       "  'question': 'Ms Ng Ling Ling asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth what are the existing platforms or initiatives that the Ministry has created to promote inter-generational collaboration and actions in tackling the issues facing Singaporeans, including the ageing population and shift in workforce composition going forward.',\n",
       "  'answer': \"Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai: MCCY brings together Singaporeans from across generations to build consensus on issues that matter to them, and plan our future together. Some examples are as follows:(a) We engage Singaporeans to forge our shared identity, and to think about the values and legacy we want to leave behind for future generations. More than 80,000 people of all ages contributed their ideas and views to the Founders' Memorial to date.(b) This year, in spite of the on-going pandemic, 74 Singaporeans aged between 17 and 73 are working together to create content to update the Singapore Citizenship Journey for new citizens.(c) In June 2020, DPM Heng Swee Keat launched the Singapore Together Emerging Stronger Conversations, for Singaporeans young and old to come together, reflect on the COVID-19 crisis, and contribute their views on how Singapore can emerge from it stronger and more resilient. The conversations will lead to Singapore Together Action Networks – collaborations formed around the salient issues that emerge from the conversations – these too will reflect inter-generational involvement.There are other initiatives to encourage meaningful connections between the young and the old, and which recognise how our ageing population can still be a force for good when coupled with the strengths of our youth.(a) Seniors have stepped up to be part of the Mentoring Alliance to mentor youths; (b) Youth Corps Singapore's Eldercare Cluster has regular youth-led initiatives such as Cantonese classes taught by seniors to youths, as well as Senior Superheroes where seniors impart practical knowledge and skills including shopping at wet markets and cooking to youths;(c) NYC supports youth-led initiatives such as Interlogue aimed at strengthening relationships between grandparents and children through a museum programme involving conversation starter kits and activities.(d) Our Singapore Fund has also supported ground-up initiatives by groups such as the Cassia Resettlement Team, Empower Aging and ACE Seniors, which bring different generations of Singaporeans together to serve the community.It will be increasingly important for different generations of Singaporeans to work together to overcome our challenges – such as the ones brought to the fore by the pandemic – and to seize the opportunities ahead of us. This ability to work together, empathise with the experiences of different generations, and recognise each others’ strengths, will also make us a more competitive workforce as our workplaces will better harness the energies of a more diverse profile of employees.Therefore, MCCY will continue to work with other agencies to provide more platforms for Singaporeans of all ages to work together. However, fostering inter-generational collaboration is not something the Government can do alone. It ultimately requires all Singaporeans, young and old, to make the effort to listen and build relationships with one another. We encourage Singaporeans of all generations to step forward to be part of our democracy of deeds, and to work together to gift a stronger, better Singapore for future generations.\"},\n",

       "  'question': 'Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth what are the efforts and upcoming plans by the Government to engage youths during this pandemic so that their views, concerns and aspirations can be taken into account as Singapore plans for a post-COVID-19 world.',\n",
       "  'answer': 'Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai: MCCY and the National Youth Council (NYC) have been engaging our youths during the COVID-19 period, through our digital platforms, to better understand and respond to their sentiments and concerns. During this period, our youths have been concerned about job prospect, finances, and their mental well-being. In response, NYC partnered youth sector organisations to create digital content and resources to help youths cope with the COVID-19 situation. For example, videos, articles and infographics addressing these concerns were published on Youth.sg. NYC also partnered CR8 Studio SG, a digital video channel that hired creative freelancers affected by COVID-19, to develop content to engage youths during the Circuit Breaker.Our youths also care about how COVID-19 has impacted our wider society, such as vulnerable groups. They see an opportunity to restate what Singapore stands for, and re-shape our society to be more inclusive, and sustainable. Many have stepped forward to organise or participate in initiatives to help vulnerable groups, and re-create social connections during this time when it is difficult to gather as we would usually do pre-COVID.Government and the National Youth Council will continue to enable and partner our youth, to address their concerns and also their aspirations to contribute during this time. These platforms include:(i) Youth Action Challenge (YAC), where youths can come up with innovative solutions on issues they care about, supported with funding and mentorship. The first run of YAC, held in September 2019 involved about 250 youths forming teams and pitching 57 project ideas to a panel of judges. The second run of the YAC will start this October, with a focus on COVID-19;(ii) Young ChangeMakers, a platform for youths to pitch ideas that benefit the community and receive grants to implement their ideas. NYC has made it easier and faster for Covid-19 related projects to access grants; and(iii) Youth Corps Singapore, where youths can volunteer for community activities in areas such as mental health, vulnerable groups and environment. COVID-19 has certainly not limited our youths’ perspectives or ambitions for our country. We have heard their views as part of an ongoing journey that started with the Youth Conversations in 2018, followed by the SG Youth Action Plan, and we will further build on these through the ongoing SG Together Emerging Stronger Conversations. Our youths will have more opportunities to discuss national issues and policies, and be part of the implementation plans, so that Singapore society can emerge stronger from COVID-19.'},\n",
       " 3: {'title': 'number and trend of cases of thefts and vandalism of community gardens in last five years and measures and public education programmes in place',\n",
       "  'question': 'Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development (a) how many cases of thefts and vandalism of community gardens have been reported in the last five years, (b) whether there has been a rising trend; (c) whether there are measures to make it easier for the gardeners to make reports; and (d) what measures and public education programmes are in place to deter and reduce these crimes.',\n",
       "  'answer': 'Mr Desmond Lee: NParks has only received infrequent feedback on theft and vandalism in community gardens over the last five years. As community gardens are shared gardening spaces set up and managed by the community, gardeners have the option of reporting such incidents to their Residents’ Committee (for public estates) or Neighbourhood Committee (for private estates), or making a police report.To allow both gardeners and other residents to enjoy community gardens respectfully and amicably, some community gardens have signs to encourage residents to contact the gardeners should they wish to request for plants or their harvest. Some community gardeners also work with the People’s Association to install community refrigerators, to allow gardeners to freely share excess harvests with other residents.NParks also encourages community gardeners to hold regular outreach events to allow other residents to appreciate the efforts and hard work that goes into these spaces, and to build stronger relationships within the community. Such events include garden open houses, gatherings to share harvests, and gatherings to grow common edible plants for the community to freely harvest. By working together, community gardening groups can ensure that their gardens continue to serve as shared spaces that beautify and add vibrancy to our neighbourhoods.'},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Desmond Lee: There are an estimated 35,000 to 45,000 species of flora and fauna native to Singapore. No species of flora or fauna native to Singapore has been classified as presumed nationally extinct in the last five years. 857 species of native flora and fauna are currently classified as critically endangered, while 352 species are classified as endangered.Youth engagement is a key component of NParks’ biodiversity conservation efforts. NParks conducts programmes for students and young Singaporeans to raise awareness of biodiversity conservation issues, and to encourage them to participate in nature conservation-related projects. This includes the Greening Schools for Biodiversity programme, which equips students with the necessary knowledge and skills to carry out habitat enhancement within their campus. There is also the Biodiversity Friends Forum programme, which nurtures young Singaporeans to become future leaders in biodiversity conservation. In addition, NParks involves young Singaporeans in its biodiversity surveys.NParks will continue to find new ways to improve awareness by involving students and young Singaporeans in biodiversity conservation efforts, as we transform into a City in Nature.'},\n",
       " 5: {'title': 'number of requests for assistance with rent payments under hdb public rental scheme and plans to consider temporary rent freeze',\n",
       "  'question': 'Ms He Ting Ru asked the Minister for National Development (a) under the HDB Public Rental Scheme, how many requests for assistance with rent payments has been received so far for this year; and (b) whether HDB is considering a temporary rent freeze for tenants.',\n",
       "  'answer': 'Mr Desmond Lee: HDB will help public rental households who need assistance with rent payments. From January to July 2020, HDB received an average of 370 requests per month for rent assistance. Over the same period, 325 households per month had their rents reduced. The reduced rent will apply for the rest of each household’s current tenancy term (up to three years). There were also 1,470 households per month emplaced on or renewed for ComCare rent assistance.Public rental rates are highly subsidised. Rents are never raised within a tenancy term, but can be lowered at any time if the household income falls. Rents are reviewed only at tenancy renewal, which happens every two to three years. Any tenants having difficulty affording their rent should approach their local HDB Branch for assistance. We will continue to monitor the situation, and ensure that public rental households in need will get the assistance that they require.'},\n",
       " 6: {'title': 'employment rate and redundancy rate of jobs support scheme recipient firms in march 2020 versus currently',\n",
       "  'question': 'Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the employment rate for Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) recipient firms in March 2020 versus currently; (b) whether the redundancy rate of the JSS recipient firms has increased and, if so, by how much; and (c) what is the unemployment or redundancy rate among firms that are recipients of JSS versus those that have declined the JSS payouts.',\n",
       "  'answer': 'Mrs Josephine Teo: Employment rate is measured at the population level, and not at the firm level.JSS support has been tiered by the estimated impact of COVID-19 on different sectors. To date, over 150,000 employers have received JSS payouts. Of these, nearly 600 employers have declined or returned their JSS payouts. It stands to reason that these 600 employers have been less severely impacted by the COVID-19 situation, with less need to trim their workforce. The data on their employment reflects this.Between March 2020 and June 2020, resident employment fell by an estimated 2.7% in firms that received Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) payouts, compared with 0.6% increase in firms that declined JSS payouts.Data on retrenchment is based on private sector establishments with at least 25 employees. In 2Q 2020, the retrenchment rate among resident employees in firms that received JSS payouts is estimated to be 3.1 per 1,000, compared to 1.8 per 1,000 in firms that declined JSS payouts.'},\n",
       " 7: {'title': 'number of adult singaporeans not having a bank account and reasons for not having one',\n",
       "  'question': 'Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis asked the Prime Minister (a) how many adult Singaporeans currently do not have a bank account; (b) what are the primary reasons for individuals not having a bank account; and (c) whether special bank accounts for Government transactions can be created through POSB for such individuals.',\n",
       "  'answer': 'Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): It is estimated that over 98% of adult Singapore residents have bank accounts. In the recent Solidarity Payment payout, 98.7% of Singaporeans who received the payments had the amounts credited into their bank accounts. As for the remaining recipients, surveys showed that many also had bank accounts but preferred to collect the payouts in cash.  Notwithstanding this high level of banking access, to ensure that Singaporeans have access to affordable and convenient basic banking services, the three local banks, Citibank, HSBC, Maybank and Standard Chartered Bank already offer Basic Banking Accounts (BBAs) since 2002. Typically, such accounts come with ATM/debit card, internet banking and electronic payment services, and can be maintained at very low or even no cost. For instance, DBS/POSB does not set any initial deposit or minimum account balance and waives the $2 maintenance fee if the individual chooses to receive eStatements. The local banks also waive fall-below fees for specific customer segments such as children, the elderly and recipients of public assistance.However, some Singaporeans remain unbanked. This may be due to low awareness of the availability of BBAs, or by choice. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has made clear its expectation that banks should provide accounts to individuals who want them. In some cases, where specific safeguards may be required to mitigate money laundering or terrorism financing risks, banks may offer accounts with more limited functionalities. There is a small number of individuals who have committed serious crimes related to sanctions imposed by the United Nations1 who may not be able to open bank accounts. Banks have significant concerns in such cases, due to the difficulty of confirming the source of the customers’ funds or the legitimacy of transactions. MAS has been working with the banks to allow accounts to be opened for such individuals with enhanced due diligence and account restrictions. MAS is working with banks on further ways to enhance financial inclusion, while ensuring that risks are adequately managed.

       "  'answer': \"Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): The Monetary Authority of Singapore's (MAS) objective is to ensure that financial institutions manage their climate-related risks well, and support our economy's transition to a sustainable and low carbon future. To do so, MAS is issuing new supervisory guidance that incorporates best practices on environmental risk management developed by global regulators, including at the Network for Greening the Financial System. MAS' proposed Guidelines on Environmental Risk Management1, which has undergone public consultation, will be finalised in Q4 2020. It will set out clear expectations for banks to implement environmentally responsible financing policies and practices, and includes:(a) Boards and senior management should maintain effective oversight of banks' management of environmental risk and address material environmental risk in their risk appetite framework;(b) For sectors that pose higher environmental risk, develop sector-specific policies, setting out banks' expectations on customers, taking into account relevant sustainability standards and certification schemes. Banks should also engage these customers to support their transition towards sustainable business practices over time; and(c) Disclose their approaches to managing environmental risk, and the impact of environmental risk on their financial performance, including quantitative metrics such as exposures to sectors with higher environmental risk. This will enable investors to better assess the banks' environmental risk exposures.Our approach is therefore not to outrightly disallow financial institutions from serving industries that are subject to climate-related risks at this stage. Instead, MAS expects financial institutions to assess their exposures to these industries, mitigate risks, work with each higher-risk customer to improve its environmental risk profile, and ensure there is senior level oversight on these issues. This approach strikes a better balance between supporting sustainable development, and recognising that many of these industries still play a role in the broader economic and social development needs of the region.MAS is engaging the banks on how they intend to implement the Guidelines. We are collaborating with fellow regulators to develop climate risk measurement methodologies and metrics. We will also continue to promote the best practices among banks on environmental risk analysis and management.\"},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Heng Swee Keat: The Rental Relief Framework provides for the Government, landlords and SME tenants to share in the rental obligations of SME businesses during this difficult period. This framework recognises that landlords, in partnership with the Government, have a shared interest in helping their SME tenants survive and succeed.In designing the Framework, the Ministry of Law had carefully considered and consulted a range of stakeholders on the potential impact on landlords. Landlords who meet the criteria for financial hardship may apply to halve their rental waiver obligations under the Additional Rental Relief component. Based on our records, about 3,000 landlords may qualify for a reduction in obligations under the financial hardship criteria1. Of these, more than 65% are aged 62 and above. As at 30 August 2020, the Registry of Rental Relief Assessors has received about 455 applications, and we expect more in the coming months.Individual and SME landlords facing cash flow difficulties can also apply to banks and finance companies to defer principal payments on their mortgages up to 31 December 2020 and to extend the loan tenure by up to the corresponding deferment period. Individual landlords who are required to provide relief to their tenants can also apply to defer interest payments, in addition to principal payments, on their mortgages up to 31 December 2020, and to extend the loan tenure by up to the corresponding deferment period.The provisions to help landlords in financial hardship strike a balance between the needs of landlords and tenants.

From February to July in 2019 and 2020, ICA received 4,503 and 4,243 applications respectively for renewal of Long-Term Visit Pass (LTVP) from foreign spouses of Singaporeans. In both years, about 0.4% of applications were rejected. Over the same period, ICA received 987 and 1,554 applications respectively for renewal of Long-Term Visit Pass Plus (LTVP+) from foreign spouses of Singaporeans. 0.9% and 0.5% respectively were rejected. Applications for STVP, LTVP and LTVP+ are considered holistically and there may be a number of reasons why a pass is not extended or renewed. STVP extension applications are rejected mostly because the sponsor or applicant was found to have adverse records, or the applicant was unable to substantiate the need for further extensions. For LTVP or LTVP+ renewal applications, reasons for rejection were mostly because the sponsor or the applicant was found to have adverse records, or was not able to demonstrate the ability to support the family financially.To assist those with genuine difficulties during the current COVID-19 situation, ICA considers additional factors, such as the prevailing travel restrictions and flight connectivity, when assessing the extension or renewal of passes.'},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mr Heng Swee Keat: To help enterprises with credit and cash flow, the Government introduced and enhanced financing schemes, such as the Temporary Bridging Loan Programme (TBLP), as part of the COVID-19 support packages. The TBLP has supported $13.1 billion of loans and 16,349 companies as of 31 August 2020. 99.7% of these companies are SMEs, and 0.3% of them are larger firms.Under the TBLP, Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) can choose to tap on their own capital, Government's loan capital or the MAS SGD Facility for ESG Loans when issuing loans. For Government's loan capital, there is an interest rate of 1.9% per annum (p.a.) without collateral. The repayment period, for a PFI which borrows from the Government, is tied to the tenure of the loans offered by the PFI, i.e. up to five years. The MAS SGD Facility for ESG Loans provides funds to PFIs at 0.1% p.a. for up to two years, and requires PFIs to provide collateral.For now, most of the loans supported under the TBLP are drawing capital from the MAS SGD Facility.

       "  'question': 'Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Law in each of the past two years (a) how many cases of neighbour disputes arising from second-hand cigarette smoke have been mediated successfully by HDB; (b) how many cases have proceeded to the Community Mediation Centre and mediated successfully; (c) how many cases are filed with the Community Disputes Resolutions Tribunals; and (d) what is the extent of increase or decrease in the number of such cases after the start of the circuit breaker period.',\n",
       "  'answer': 'Mr K Shanmugam: In a densely populated state such as Singapore, disagreements between neighbours may arise. These include instances where second-hand cigarette smoke from one neighbour affects another. In some cases, neighbours are able to discuss such issues directly and resolve them amicably. Finding mutually acceptable solutions in this way strengthens neighbourly relations in the long run. In instances where neighbours are unable to resolve the dispute themselves, the Government has created avenues to help neighbours work out their disagreements. While Housing and Development Board (HDB) officers do not themselves conduct mediation, the Community Mediation Centre (CMC) provides trained, neutral, mediators who can help neighbours arrive at mutually acceptable solutions. Mediation at the CMC is generally voluntary.  Between January 2019 and July 2020, 71 cases concerning second-hand cigarette smoke were registered with the CMC. During and after the circuit breaker, there was an increase in the number of disputes over cigarette smoke registered with the CMC, up from an average of two cases before, to eight cases monthly. 70 out of the 71 cases registered were voluntary. To date, nine cases have proceeded to mediation. Six of these cases were successful. About two-thirds of the 71 cases did not proceed to mediation because one party either declined mediation or did not respond.As mediation is generally voluntary, it has its limitations. As can be seen, despite the relatively high success rate of CMC mediations, the take up rate remains low. In some cases, parties may presume that the relationship has deteriorated so much that there is no point attempting to negotiate. Mediators also cannot make binding decisions; they can only help parties reach a mutual agreement. Some parties believe that it is better to skip mediation and go straight to the courts, in order to obtain a permanent, binding order, in their favour. The Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals (CDRT) was established in 2015 as an avenue of last resort. A CDRT judge can require parties to attend mediation. If mediation is not successful, the dispute can also be litigated before the CDRT. Between January 2019 and July 2020, 25 claims relating to excessive smoke, caused by activities such as the burning of incense and cigarette smoking, were filed at the CDRT. There was no discernible shift in the number of claims filed with the CDRT during and after the circuit breaker.The Government is mindful that even with the CMC and CDRT in place, there continues to be difficult cases that are not resolved and differences not reconciled.  It has been about five years since the community dispute resolution framework was launched. It is timely to review how we can strengthen it and make it more effective.'},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Government is closely monitoring the global progress in the development of COVID-19 vaccines, and taking active steps to ensure that Singapore has timely access to an effective and safe vaccine when this becomes available. Duke-NUS Medical School is collaborating with a United States biotechnology company, Arcturus Therapeutics, to co-develop a COVID-19 vaccine. The school supported the pre-clinical studies by conducting rapid screening of potential vaccine candidates for effectiveness and safety, and by conducting animal trials. Phase 1 human clinical trials for this vaccine started in early August at the SingHealth Investigational Medicine Unit (IMU). Singapore is also participating in the discussions led by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on the multi-country Solidarity Vaccine Trials.Singapore is actively pursuing the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines with a number of pharmaceutical companies, while keeping abreast of the progress of the various vaccine candidates under development. These discussions are covered by confidentiality obligations and we will not be able to provide more information at this point in time. We are also actively engaged in international discussions, such as with the WHO, CEPI and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (Gavi), as well as like-minded countries to look into early, fair and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines through the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX) Facility. MOH is working on plans for the administration of a COVID-19 vaccine when it is assessed to be safe and effective for use, and has received the appropriate approvals by the Health Sciences Authority. This will take into consideration the characteristics of the vaccine, suitability for different population subgroups, and availability of the supply and other factors. Our priority is to protect individuals who are most vulnerable or at high risk from the disease, as well as those who may be more likely exposed to infection, while working progressively towards a high level of vaccination in the population.

       "  'answer': \"Mr S Iswaran: In recent years, the Government has made a concerted push to drive the adoption of cashless payment solutions by merchants.  We have made significant strides in developing a single, interoperable e-payment solution which unifies different payment schemes under a single Singapore Quick Response (SGQR) label, making it easy, convenient and secure for users. There are understandable concerns about fraud, errors and security threats behind cashless payment solutions, among merchants as well as consumers. Beyond existing verification measures and safeguards within payment systems, merchants and consumers are encouraged to exercise vigilance to combat such scams, keep devices secure with the latest security patches, and maintain their password secrecy.  Recently, concerns were raised that merchants unfamiliar with cashless payments may face greater risk of payment scams. In June 2020, IMDA launched the Hawkers Go Digital programme, as part of a nationwide effort to help micro-enterprises like stallholders at NEA hawker centres, HDB coffeeshops and wet markets and JTC industrial canteens, to accelerate the adoption of the unified SGQR solution. We also established the SG Digital Office (SDO), mobilising 1,000 Digital Ambassadors to work together with NETS to engage and guide stallholders. Along with the deployment of the SGQR code, NETS will also help stallholders install the NETSBiz App on their digital device and teach them how to verify successful payment transactions in real-time. This App provides real-time notifications of successful payment transactions in English or Mandarin, has a voice notification capability in English and Mandarin, and allows stallholders to view their transaction histories. Stallholders may also approach NETS personnel or SDO's Digital Ambassadors on the ground should they need further assistance. \"},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Gan Kim Yong: Under the Community Mental Health Masterplan (CMHMP), primary care providers receive support to improve early identification and access to mental health care for persons with mental health issues. Mental health services have been set up in the polyclinics. Family physicians, nurses, psychologists and medical social workers sited at these polyclinics are trained to recognise early signs of mental distress among patients so that they can provide timely mental health assessment and intervention. In addition, over 220 general practitioners (GP) have been trained under the Mental Health General Practitioner Partnership Programme (MHGPP) to identify, diagnose and manage persons with mental health issues in the community. Government subsidies are available at polyclinics and Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) subsidies are available at CHAS GPs for Singaporeans who seek treatment for mental health issues in the primary care setting. In November 2019, CHAS Green was introduced to allow all chronic patients, regardless of income, to enjoy CHAS subsidies for mental illnesses under the Chronic Disease Management Programme (CDMP) (namely major depression, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia) at CHAS GPs clinics. Currently, patients can also withdraw up to $500 per year from their MediSave for the outpatient management of conditions under the CDMP. For patients with complex chronic conditions, this annual withdrawal limit will be raised to $700 from 1 January 2021. Lastly, those aged 60 and above may tap on Flexi-MediSave. In addition to providing accessible and affordable care for persons with mental health condition(s), the Agency of Integrated Care (AIC) helps to coordinate care across the health and social sectors for persons with mental health issues. Primary care providers, community partners, ground agencies and members of the public can refer persons with/suspected to have mental health condition(s) to AIC, who will then work with relevant stakeholders to support clients with the appropriate medical and social services.

       "  'answer': 'Mr K Shanmugam: Under the Private Security Industry Act (PSIA), a person must be licensed before carrying out the functions of a security officer. Security screening is part of the licensing procedures. This reduces the risk that persons abuse their positions as security officers to commit crimes against their clients or the public. Security officers perform duties such as patrol, access control, and responding to incidents. They need to be properly trained and qualified, so that they can perform these important duties effectively. The process of licence application and training can be done concurrently. A person can obtain his licence and complete the requisite training in about two weeks if he meets the security screening and course requirements. It is also a licensing condition that security officers above the age of 60 be certified medically fit for duty before being deployed. This is for their own welfare and safety, as the job of a security officer is physically demanding. In short, there are important reasons for these requirements. The Police can allow security agencies to deploy as security officers, only persons who have been security cleared and are properly qualified.'},\n",

For example, Starbucks offers a $0.50 discount to customers who bring their own cups or tumblers, and SaladStop! offers a free topping for customers who bring their own bowls for takeaway orders. We are heartened by the initiatives and commitment of the private sector and encourage more companies to join in this effort.Addressing the excessive consumption of disposables remains a priority of my Ministry and NEA. A Citizens\\' Workgroup to look into measures to check the excessive consumption of disposables will be convened this month. We look forward to hearing their ideas on how we can encourage everyone to play his or her part to reduce the use of disposables, including incentivising the use of environment-friendly food and drink containers.'},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The COVID-19 Support Grant (CSG) supports lower- to middle-income resident employees who, as a result of the economic impact of COVID-19, are presently i) Involuntarily unemployed due to retrenchment or contract termination; ii) Placed on involuntary no-pay leave for at least three consecutive months; or iii) Experiencing reduced monthly salary of at least 30% for at least three consecutive months. As at 16 August 2020, around 115,000 individuals had applied for the CSG. Of these, MSF approved the CSG for around 65,000 recipients. About 41,000 applicants were unsuccessful, and around 9,000 applications were still being processed. The unsuccessful CSG applications were mainly due to applicants not meeting the eligibility criteria for salary loss, job loss, or no-pay leave, or were not employees. This accounted for almost three quarters of unsuccessful applications. Other reasons included employment details not being verifiable, and the Annual Property Value and household income criteria not being met.As at 16 August 2020, MSF had received around 8,000 appeals for the CSG. Around 7,500 of these appeals were approved.

       "  'answer': 'Mr Chan Chun Sing: Between January 2020 when the first local COVID-19 case was confirmed and July 2020, the Consumer Price Index-All Items1 declined by 0.2 per cent on a year-on-year basis. This decline was largely driven by a fall in the cost of pre-primary education, electricity, outpatient services and petrol, which outweighed an increase in food prices.Nonetheless, the Government recognises that cost of living may remain a cause for concern for Singaporeans, especially those who have suffered employment losses or wage cuts during the current economic downturn. To help Singaporeans tide over this difficult period, the Government has rolled out several support measures, including the Care and Support Package, COVID-19 Support Grant, and SG United Jobs and Skills Package. The Government will continue to monitor developments closely, and stands ready to provide more support to Singaporeans if necessary. '},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The Special Needs Savings Scheme (SNSS) enables parents to set aside their CPF savings for the long-term care of their children with special needs. Parents can nominate their children with special needs to receive a regular stream of fixed payouts upon the parents' demise. If the SNSS nominee passes on before the parents, the CPF savings originally bequeathed to the SNSS nominee remain in the parents' CPF accounts. If the parents wish to, they can update their CPF nomination to specify how their CPF savings will be distributed upon their demise.However, if the SNSS nominee passes on after the parents, any unused SNSS monies upon the demise of the nominee, will form part of the nominee’s estate, and be distributed either via a will or intestacy laws. Parents who would like to decide how their bequeathed CPF savings will be distributed in the event that their SNSS nominees pass on after them can consider setting up a trust to specify how their bequeathed monies will be used. Parents of SNSS nominees who are assessed to lack mental capacity can also apply to the Court to make a will on their nominees' behalf.\"},\n",

The unemployment rates of PMETs by residential status, age and sex, from 2010 to 2019, are provided in Table 2.

       "  'answer': 'Mrs Josephine Teo: Over 1,000 fresh graduate trainees have taken up traineeships under the SGUnited Traineeships programme. The majority of traineeship positions filled are in growth sectors such as Information Communications Technology and Media, Professional Services, and Financial Services. As the process of shortlisting and selecting suitable trainees by host organisations takes time, we can expect to see more placements into traineeships subsequently. We have expanded outreach to increase awareness of these opportunities. To reach out to fresh graduates on opportunities under the SGUnited Traineeships programme, WSG works closely with the Ministry of Education, the Institutes of Higher Learning, the National Trades Union Congress and People’s Association. We also reach out to graduates through various digital media.The traineeships do not automatically convert into a permanent job. However, we are hopeful that companies will find a good number of trainees a good fit and make them part of their permanent staff. This will depend largely on the fit of each trainee to the job, and the business situation and hiring needs of the host organisation when the traineeships are completed. Workforce Singapore’s experience with Attach-and-Train programmes so far has been that host organisations that are impressed with trainees will place them in full-time positions in the companies to make the most of the time and money they have invested in the attachment. The newly-launched Jobs Growth Incentive scheme will give greater support to businesses to expand and grow their local headcounts over the next six months. This will also help spur hiring of trainees.For cases where the traineeship does not result in a permanent job, the experience will equip the trainee with industry-relevant knowledge and skills, and help to burnish their credentials and value proposition to other employers. The Government will also continue to support them in their job search journey, through career matching services offered by WSG and NTUC’s Employability and Employment Institute.'},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mrs Josephine Teo: There are currently about 400 firms placed on the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF) Watchlist for having a higher share of foreign PMETs compared to their industry peers, or high concentration of a single foreign nationality source. Employment Pass (EP) applications from these firms are held back, while the Tripartite Alliance for Fair & Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) engages these firms to help them improve their human resource practices. Firms on the FCF Watchlist have not flouted any rules but have been identified through proactive surveillance. Measures must therefore be proportional and also consider the impact on their existing local workforce. In most instances, employers on the FCF Watchlist have been responsive to TAFEP’s engagement efforts and expanded their employment of local PMETs. Naming these firms and withdrawing their access to Government grants and tax incentive schemes would likely have frustrated their local hiring efforts and is ultimately counter-productive. Instead, following TAFEP’s intervention, many firms exit the FCF Watchlist within a year. For the minority who are uncooperative, their work pass privileges remain suspended.We plan to proactively engage even more companies under the FCF, such as those whose Singaporean core has been weakening, or whose EP and S Pass workforce are concentrated with a single foreign nationality source.

       "  'answer': 'Mr Ong Ye Kung: LTA regularly reviews the provision of public bus services to ensure that they are within 400 metres of developments, subject to a minimum level of ridership. This approach strikes a balance between providing connectivity while maintaining prudent use of public funds. The developments in Brickland are currently within 400 metres of public bus services and residents are served by Services 172, 983 and 991 to amenities such as the mosque, polyclinic and Teck Whye market. Besides the option of walking about 250 metres to the polyclinic and Teck Whye market, residents can also transfer to Service 307 along Choa Chu Kang Avenue 1. LTA will continue to monitor travel patterns and adjust the provision of bus services where necessary. This can come in the form of additional trips for existing bus services to cater to increased demand in new estates such as Brickland.

       "  'answer': 'Mrs Josephine Teo: Employment rate is measured at the population level, and not at the firm level.JSS support has been tiered by the estimated impact of COVID-19 on different sectors. To date, over 150,000 employers have received JSS payouts. Of these, nearly 600 employers have declined or returned their JSS payouts. It stands to reason that these 600 employers have been less severely impacted by the COVID-19 situation, with less need to trim their workforce. The data on their employment reflects this.Between March 2020 and June 2020, resident employment fell by an estimated 2.7% in firms that received Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) payouts, compared with 0.6% increase in firms that declined JSS payouts.Data on retrenchment is based on private sector establishments with at least 25 employees. In 2Q 2020, the retrenchment rate among resident employees in firms that received JSS payouts is estimated to be 3.1 per 1,000, compared to 1.8 per 1,000 in firms that declined JSS payouts.'},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mrs Josephine Teo: In the Unity, Resilience and Solidarity Budgets, the Government introduced measures to provide greater assurance and support to workers and businesses. Budget support measures, including the Jobs Support Scheme, have helped businesses to retain and retrain local workers. These measures have provided some cushion for the labour market. While the number of retrenchments rose in 1Q 2020, it was significantly lower than the quarterly peak during the Global Financial Crisis (1Q 2020: 3,000 (preliminary) versus 1Q 2009: 12,760). However, I expect labour market conditions to weaken in the second quarter given the sharp fall in demand globally, as well as the implementation of circuit breaker measures in Singapore. We have therefore stepped up efforts to help displaced workers reskill and find new employment opportunities.The recently-announced SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package under the Fortitude Budget aims to create a total of 100,000 jobs, traineeships, and training opportunities. We will be expanding the SGUnited Jobs initiative to provide more than 40,000 jobs for locals in 2020. There is a wide range of job opportunities under the SGUnited Jobs initiative, which has been running since end-March. This includes short-term jobs to handle COVID-19 related operations, as well as longer-term jobs created in the Public Service and publicly-funded sectors, such as healthcare and early childhood education. We will also scale up career conversion programmes under the Adapt and Grow and TechSkills Accelerator initiatives to help locals join sectors with strong growth potential.  We are providing our recent and new graduates, as well as mid-career jobseekers, with more opportunities to gain valuable industry-relevant experience through the SGUnited Traineeships and SGUnited Mid-Career Traineeships programmes. These will increase their employability and prepare them to seize new opportunities when the economy recovers. In the Unity Budget, we introduced a hiring incentive under the SkillsFuture Mid-Career Support Package. We are now enhancing the hiring incentive to cover all local workers, with higher support for mature workers. We are keeping our foreign workforce policy tight to ensure that our foreign workforce complements rather than substitutes our local workforce. We are maintaining the increases to the minimum qualifying salary at the Employment Pass and S Pass level which I announced this year, and are continuing with previously announced plans to cut the S Pass quota in various sectors. The quota system ensures companies retain a core of Singaporeans if they wish to continue hiring work permit and S Pass holders; a smaller base of locals will also mean a smaller quota. We also strengthened the Fair Consideration Framework earlier this year by requiring more jobs to be advertised and raising the penalties for all forms of discriminatory hiring practices. Strengthening the Singaporean core in the workforce remains our objective and we will continue to pursue this, even as we take into account current economic conditions.'},\n",

       "  'question': 'Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Trade and Industry how will the economy be reopened in stages after the circuit breaker ends.',\n",
       "  'answer': 'Mr Chan Chun Sing: Singapore will exit our Circuit Breaker from 2 June 2020. We will ramp up our economic activity safely, in order to protect lives and livelihoods.Currently, even during the Circuit Breaker period, we have allowed key companies in our global manufacturing, biomedical, and petrochemical sectors to continue functioning and supporting global supply chains.From 2 June 2020, we will resume additional economic activities that do not pose a high risk of transmission. Sectors that will be allowed to reopen or ramp up their operations in Phase One include those that are closely intertwined with global supply chains, and those in settings with lower transmission risks. These include most manufacturing and production facilities, as well as office-based businesses and those that do not require interactions with large groups of people.Businesses that reopen must comply with the requirements on safe management practices set out by the Ministry of Manpower and respective government agencies. These include enforcing safe distancing and mask wearing amongst their employees at the workplace, staggering working hours and break times, ensuring no cross-deployment of staff across teams or worksites, reducing physical interaction or mixing amongst workers, and cancelling or deferring social gatherings. In addition, businesses must allow their employees to Work From Home (WFH) to the maximum extent. Employees should only go into the office when demonstrably needed (e.g. to access systems or equipment that cannot be accessed from home, or to fulfil legal requirements such as completing contracts or transactions). The Government will conduct checks, and close businesses that do not provide a safe workplace, or fail to comply with safe management measures.If community transmission rates remain low and stable in Phase One, more firms will gradually be allowed to reopen in subsequent phases. These include more consumer services (e.g. retail shops), and fewer restrictions on existing services (e.g. dining-in will be allowed at F&B establishments). Employers should, however, still ensure that those who can WFH continue to do so.'},\n",

       "  'question': 'Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Manpower whether employers who have received payouts under Jobs Support Scheme are required to adhere to any stipulation in relation to consumption of vacation leave by their employees or requiring employees to go on no-pay leave.',\n",
       "  'answer': \"Mrs Josephine Teo: Given the varied financial positions of employers, the tripartite partners agreed not to take a prescriptive approach on the type and degree of cost-saving measures (e.g. consumption of annual leave, no-pay leave) in issuing advisories1 to guide employers. With the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) payout, employers should provide some wage support to employees even if their employees are not working. To manage cost pressures and conserve manpower for when they are most needed, employers may request employees to clear some of their paid annual leave when business activity has been sharply reduced. Employers should be allowed to do so, and encouraged to seek their employees’ support and understanding to help the business get ready for business resumption. Where employers have genuine cashflow issues, they may not even be able to afford placing employees on paid annual leave and may have to request employees to go on no-pay leave, in order to avoid the worse alternative of retrenchment. In such instances, tripartite partners have made it clear that employers should allow their employees to seek additional temporary employment to boost their incomes. The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) is closely monitoring such cost-saving measures to ensure that they are implemented responsibly and fairly with reasonable support to employees. We will investigate employees' concerns that are brought to our attention. Irresponsible employers may see a withdrawal of Government-paid employment support including future JSS payouts, and suspension of their work pass privileges.The tripartite partners urge both employers and employees to be open, transparent and understanding in their discussions on cost-saving measures and take a long-term view on saving jobs and emerging stronger together from the crisis.\"},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Lawrence Wong: The question by Ms Ong presumes that we are reducing the green and natural spaces in Singapore. But in fact, our urban plans seek to expand such spaces. In 2000, we had about 5,500 hectares of land in nature reserves, nature areas, nature parks, parks and gardens. We have increased this to 7,800 hectares today.  Under the Master Plan 2019, which guides development over the next 10 to 15 years, we will add another 1,000 hectares of parks, gardens, and park connectors. We announced plans to transform Singapore from a City in a Garden into a City in Nature during the Committee of Supply debate in March 2020, including plans for a new nature park at Sungei Khatib Bongsu, and planting one million trees by 2030. We will also continue implementing innovative and practical solutions to intensify greenery and restore nature in our urban areas, to further enhance liveability for our residents. In addition, where there are any new developments close to sensitive nature areas, robust assessments are undertaken in consultation with stakeholders, to ensure that the development works are done in an environmentally sensitive manner.These efforts, together with other efforts to enhance our natural ecosystem and marine environment that provide carbon storage and sequestration, will strengthen our climate resilience.

       "  'answer': 'Mr K Shanmugam: From January to April 2020, a total of 5,425 scam cases were reported with at least $60.4 million cheated. Of these, 394 were COVID-19 related scams, with at least $1.4 million cheated.There are three scam types of concern that are related to COVID-19. First, e-commerce scams relating to the sale of face masks and hand sanitisers. Second, scams where scammers impersonate officials from the Ministry of Health (MOH) to obtain from victims their personal data and information. Third, phishing scams involving fraudulent emails and text messages containing fake offers or fake information on COVID-19 payouts, to trick victims into divulging their credit or debit card details and One-Time Passwords (OTP).The Police have been taking action against such scammers. Between 3 February and 8 April 2020, they mounted island-wide operations leading to the arrest of 27 persons who were involved in scams amounting to more than $484,000. In these cases, the scammers had exploited the use of e-commerce platforms and online channels such as Gumtree, Facebook Marketplace, Carousell, WhatsApp and Telegram. Of the 27 subjects, 16 have been charged in Court.The Police are also ramping up public education and awareness efforts. They and the National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC) are working with the Ministry of Communications and Information to issue scam advisories via WhatsApp on the Gov.sg platform. Prior to the COVID-19 situation, the Police were already working with Residents’ Committees and grassroots volunteers to spread scam alerts to residents, including senior citizens, via WhatsApp and community events like block parties, roadshows, festive events and Community Safety & Security Programmes (CSSPs). One such CSSP focusing on the elderly is the Silver Watch Group. Launched in 2013, the initiative aims to impart elderly residents with crime prevention knowledge by keeping them informed of the latest crime situation and encouraging them to share relevant advice with their peers. These activities will resume gradually with the easing of safe distancing measures.The key to the fight against scams is a discerning public. We should be sceptical of promises of incredulous inducements, transact only on reliable platforms, and always check with the relevant authorities when approached by dubious entities purporting to be their officials.Everyone has a part to play in the fight against scams. Members of the public are urged to stay vigilant and report possible scams promptly to the Police.'},\n",
       " 60: {'title': 'extending relief under part 2 of covid-19 (temporary measures) act 2020 to cover rental agreements between vehicle hire companies and private hire car drivers',\n",
       "  'question': 'Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Minister for Law whether relief under Part 2 of the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020 can be extended to cover rental agreements between vehicle hire companies and private hire car drivers.',\n",
       "  'answer': 'Mr K Shanmugam: The COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020 (the \"Act\") provides temporary relief from legal action for those who are unable to perform certain contracts as a result of COVID-19. The Government has studied the possibility of extending temporary relief under Part 2 of the Act to rental agreements between vehicle hire companies and Private Hire Car (PHC) drivers, but has assessed that this is not necessary for the time being. Part 2 of the Act imposes a moratorium on legal action, so that parties have time to negotiate and work out their differences. However, this does not, in itself, address the substantive decline in earnings faced by drivers during this period. To this end, the Government has been working closely with the taxi and PHC operators, the National Taxi Association (NTA), and the National Private Hire Vehicles Association (NPHVA), to provide targeted relief for drivers. The current package of relief measures includes cash grants, initiatives by operators, creating supplementary sources of income for drivers, and providing upskilling opportunities for drivers to move into adjacent sectors.For instance, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) has worked with tripartite partners to launch the Point-to-Point Support Package (PPSP) to support drivers who have seen their livelihoods badly affected. Through the PPSP\\'s Special Relief Fund (SRF), active PHC drivers can receive up to $10 per vehicle per day (or $300 per month), until 12 October 2020. Apart from the SRF, PHC drivers can also draw on the Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme (SIRS) which provides eligible persons with $1,000 per month for nine months (or $9,000 in total).All in all, under the SRF and SIRS, drivers can receive up to $1,300 of Government support per month in support to tide them over this challenging period. This is in addition to the Solidarity Payment, and other cash payouts announced under the enhanced Care and Support Package.The Government also notes that some PHC operators and rental companies have stepped forward to offer rental waivers and discounts on commission fees.  To enable drivers to supplement their income, LTA has also temporarily allowed drivers to deliver food and groceries. To date, more than 10,000 drivers have taken on deliveries, and this has helped to cushion the fall in ridership earnings. LTA will continue working with tripartite partners to help drivers.Support is also available for drivers who are looking to upskill and move laterally into adjacent sectors, or into new sectors. Under the Self-Employed Persons (SEP) Training Support Scheme, SEPs can receive up to $10 per hour when they attend approved courses. To sum up, the Government has been working closely with tripartite partners in the PHC ecosystem to come together and share the burden in an equitable manner. For now, the Government has assessed that legislative intervention is not necessary. We will however continue to monitor the situation, and make changes if necessary.'},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: On the afternoon of 30 April 2020, strong solar heating of land areas coupled with convergence of winds in the region led to intense thundery showers over Paya Lebar, Punggol and Hougang. The total rainfall of 128.4 millimetres that day was one of the highest daily rainfall ever recorded in Singapore over the past 30 years. As the capacity of roadside drains were overwhelmed by the intense rainfall, flash floods resulted at locations such as Upper Paya Lebar Service Road, Lorong Gambir, Tampines Road, Serangoon Avenue 2 and Lichi Avenue (which is close to Sennett Estate). These flash floods lasted between 10 to 30 minutes. PUB officers were on site to actively engage affected residents, provide sandbags and loan the portable Dam-Easy flood panels to prevent floodwaters from entering homes. These flood panels, which the Public Utilities Board (PUB) started loaning to residents and businesses in flood-prone areas since the start of the monsoon season in 2019, can be set up quickly during a flash flood. These flood panels were used by one of the residents during the 30 April 2020 rainstorm, who found them effective in preventing water from entering his home.Drainage Improvement WorksAs part of PUB's broader efforts to address the impacts of climate change, PUB had raised the drainage design standards to cater to higher rainfall intensity in 2011. Since then, the Government has invested almost $2 billion in drainage works, and will invest another $190 million this year to enhance our flood resilience.In most of the areas affected by the intense rainfall on 30 April 2020, a number of flood alleviation projects have been recently completed or are ongoing. For example, PUB completed the upgrading of the Tampines Canal (from Hougang Avenue 1 to Hougang Avenue 7) in March 2019 at a project cost of $27 million to alleviate flooding along Tampines Road. The hydraulic analysis showed that the completed works had successfully reduced the flood area by 86%, including a large section of Tampines Road. As a result, the flash flood on 30 April 2020 was confined to a localised road depression at the junction of Tampines Road and Hougang Avenue 1. PUB will study the feasibility of raising the depressed road junction.For the low-lying Upper Paya Lebar Service Road, works are on-going to divert stormflow from existing drains to larger new drains. The works are expected to complete in 2021 and will further improve flood protection in these areas. In addition, PUB will be upgrading the drains serving Serangoon Avenue 2 and Lorong Gambir to alleviate flooding. These works are expected to commence over the next two years.In the case of Sennett Estate, which is a low-lying area and prone to flooding, PUB has been progressively upgrading the drains serving the estate between 2006 and 2015. There are on-going works to upgrade the remaining stretches of drains in the estate. When completed in 2021, flood protection for Sennett Estate will be further enhanced.While PUB will continue with efforts to improve drainage systems, it is not practical to expand our drains to meet every extreme rainfall event in land-scarce Singapore. Besides drainage improvements, PUB will put in place cost-effective measures to minimise flood risks and better manage flood events. For instance, PUB is in the midst of upgrading its rainfall forecasting radar technology, which will help improve prediction of locations where heavy rainfall might occur and enhance its response time to potential flash floods. Members of the public can also stay updated on weather and flash flood warnings by subscribing to NEA's or PUB's mobile apps and SMS alerts. In the event of a flash flood, members of the public are advised to take appropriate safety measures, such as to avoid driving and walking in flooded areas.\"},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Data on life expectancy, hospital 30-day re-admissions and prevalence of chronic conditions by income groups is not available. There are many factors that influence hospital re-admissions. For example, the patient's age, presence of any pre-existing conditions, reason for initial hospital admission, quality of inpatient care, transition to community care, and follow-up care. Home environment and family support are also important contributing factors. Public hospitals have introduced various programmes to reduce re-admissions. This includes the Hospital-to-Home (H2H) programme, which supports patients' transition home and links patients and care-givers with appropriate community-based services. The H2H programme has served more than 14,000 patients.For chronic conditions, using educational levels as a proxy for socio-economic status (SES), men with primary education and below were more likely to have diabetes (1.3 times), but less likely to have hypertension (0.9 times) or high cholesterol (0.6 times) when compared to men with post-secondary education. However, for women with primary education and below, the chances were higher at 3.4 times for diabetes, 1.9 times for hypertension, and 1.4 times for high cholesterol compared to those with post-secondary education.1Persons in the lower SES group with chronic diseases have good access to healthcare services and health outcomes. Among Singaporeans with primary education and below who have chronic conditions like diabetes, hypertension and high blood cholesterol, more than 90% had visited their doctor in the previous year for their condition. They had comparable disease outcomes with better educated Singaporeans in managing their blood sugar and cholesterol levels, although less so for blood pressure control.Individuals can achieve good health outcomes by taking charge of their health, seeking timely treatment and adopting healthy lifestyles. MOH facilitates this by reducing cost barriers to healthcare. For example, on health screening, subsidies under Screen for Life were enhanced in September 2017. Under this revised scheme, Pioneer Generation pays $0 for screening whereas Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) blue/orange cardholders (as well as Merdeka Generation since November 2019) pay only $2, and all other Singaporeans pay $5. This payment covers screening tests, doctor's consultation as well as the first follow-up consultation at CHAS GP clinics.MOH will continue to monitor health inequalities and put in place measures to ensure that all Singaporeans have access to quality and timely healthcare.\"},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The total number of dengue cases in 2020 has exceeded 6,000 so far – more than double that over the same period in 2019. The number of weekly dengue cases remains high, hovering at around 300 to 400 cases per week, and the total number of dengue cases is projected to exceed the 16,000 cases in 2019. To manage the expected increase in cases as we approach the traditional peak dengue season, The National Environment Agency\\'s (NEA) dengue operations are continuing during this circuit breaker period. NEA has also called for all stakeholders to take concerted action to suppress the Aedes mosquito population.  Regular housekeeping and maintenance of premises and common areas are crucial to curb dengue transmission. Raising the standards of personal and public hygiene are not only critical for our defence against COVID-19, they also mitigate the spread of dengue. Good housekeeping at residential premises is critical, especially as more people are working from home. NEA has observed a 50% increase in Aedes mosquito breeding in homes over the past three years, compared to the preceding three years. NEA therefore brought forward the launch of the National Dengue Prevention campaign to 22 March to rally the community to be vigilant in carrying out the Mozzie Wipeout to remove potential mosquito breeding habitats. Homeowners of landed houses are also urged to check their roof gutters and perimeter drains in their compounds for potential mosquito breeding habitats.NEA is working closely with stakeholders in the Inter-Agency Dengue Task Force, including Town Councils, to remove potential mosquito breeding habitats in public areas and housing estates. Despite increased demands on the cleaning sector arising from the ongoing COVID-19 situation, NEA has worked with our cleaning service providers and Town Councils to ensure that cleaning of higher footfall areas and flushing of drains are not compromised, and even stepped up as necessary.Even though businesses are closed during the circuit breaker period, NEA requires owners of premises and work sites to continue with proactive vector control measures. Pest control operators are allowed to continue operating during the circuit breaker period. Owners of premises, especially construction and renovation sites which have a propensity for water pooling that allows for larger mosquito breeding habitats, should apply for \"Time-Limited Exemptions\" for their workers to return to their premises to perform essential mosquito prevention measures during this period. NEA has also embarked on a stepped-up inspection regime of construction sites, prioritising hotspots which are located in dengue clusters or have a previous record of mosquito breeding. NEA has reached out to members of the Singapore Contractors Association Limited and operators of dormitories to sustain their vector control works. This posture will be maintained for the entire duration of the Circuit Breaker period. All stakeholders, residents, contractors and business owners, have a part to play in preventing dengue. Everyone must step up efforts to eradicate mosquito breeding habitats together, uphold good personal and public hygiene, to protect themselves and their loved ones from dengue and COVID-19.'},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Lawrence Wong: Workers performing essential services play an integral role in ensuring that critical functions remain operational during the circuit breaker period. In Town Councils, essential services include services such as conservancy and lift management. In response to the economic challenges posed by the COVID-19 outbreak, the Government has rolled out a series of support measures. These include the corporate income tax rebate, the waiver and rebate of the foreign worker levy, and the Jobs Support Scheme, where the Government co-funds up to 75% of the wages of local employees. These measures will help to stabilise businesses and minimise any impact on the livelihoods of our workers, including those in essential services. The Government has also taken steps to safeguard our essential service workers. To suppress the spread of COVID-19 at workplaces, employers are required, by law, to implement appropriate safe distancing measures. Specific to the cleaning sector, the tripartite partners have issued a joint advisory to ensure the sustainability of the sector in view of COVID-19. Amongst other measures, this advisory calls upon employers to provide suitable protective equipment, and to remunerate their cleaners appropriately, such as through increasing the wages of cleaners with higher workloads. Essential service workers with concerns about workplace safety or other employment matters can provide feedback to MOM for further follow-up. To minimise the risk of transmission amongst workers during the circuit breaker period, there has also been a reduction in the number of workers performing essential services. This could result in degradation of services, and we seek the public’s understanding on this matter. We thank all essential service workers for their efforts and call upon the public to also show their support.'},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mr Lawrence Wong: About 5,200 public rental households, or about 10% of all public rental households, are in rent arrears. In terms of value, about 75% of them owe less than $3,000 in rent, and in terms of duration, about half of them owe less than one year's worth of rent. The Housing Development Board (HDB) takes a compassionate and holistic approach when assisting tenants who are in arrears, and will seek to understand their individual circumstances. HDB has various assistance measures in place to help public rental households in arrears.For households whose financial circumstances have changed (e.g. household income has fallen), HDB will assist to reduce their monthly rent upon appeal. Tenants who need more time to resolve their arrears are also allowed to pay off the arrears in instalments. HDB also works closely with MSF's Social Service Offices (SSOs), and will refer households who may be in need of financial assistance to the SSOs. For tenants who prefer to move to a smaller rental flat to ease their rental burden, HDB will help to facilitate their transfer. In the last three years, HDB assisted 159 households in arrears to move from 2-room flats to 1-room flats. The vast majority of them had four persons or fewer in the household. Termination of rental tenancies is only taken as a last resort, and would not be solely due to the accumulation of rent arrears.

       "  'answer': 'Mr Chan Chun Sing: On 3 April, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce announced a set of circuit breaker measures, including only permitting entities providing essential services to continue operating onsite with reduced manpower. This took effect from 7 April. Around 80,000 entities were allowed to operate, with 21% of our total workforce operating on-site. On 21 April, the Taskforce directed a further reduction in work premises which could operate on-site. Around 45,000 entities were allowed to operate, with 17% of our total workforce operating on-site.We are acutely aware that the circuit breaker will disrupt businesses and have a substantial impact on our economy, but it is also essential in the fight against COVID-19. Our primary objective in this fight is to save lives and protect Singaporeans and our families. We recognise that the more stringent the measures we put in place to curb transmission of the virus, the bigger the impact on our economy. But the alternative of not taking sufficiently stringent measures to curb the virus will result in more infections and more deaths.We must therefore work together – business, workers and Government – to make the circuit breaker as effective as possible so that we protect lives and recover faster and emerge stronger. Every business can play their part – strictly observe the circuit breaker measures and shut down onsite activities if you have not received approval to operate so that your workers and their families can stay safe. For essential firms that have to continue to operate, minimise the number of workers who have to travel to work onsite and make sure that safe distancing measures are implemented at the workplace. As long as we can keep the number of cases low, this will mitigate the need for a circuit breaker.'},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Singapore adopts a multi-prong approach to suicide prevention based on building mental resilience, encouraging help seeking and early identification, supporting at-risk groups, and providing crisis support.The reasons for suicides are often complex and multi-dimensional requiring a holistic management approach. Consequently, funds have been allocated for overall mental health awareness, prevention, detection and intervention and not specially for suicide prevention. In FY18, MOH's expenditure on mental health was approximately $310 million, comprising operating subvention to Institute of Mental Health (IMH), psychiatry services in Public Healthcare Institutions and intermediate and long-term care facilities, including funding for the various programmes under the National Mental Health Blueprint and Community Mental Health Masterplan.  Social service agencies also have a key role in suicide prevention, by providing community-based intervention and support to individuals who are in distress. Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) provides support to individuals facing crises, thinking about or are affected by suicide. In addition to SOS, agencies such as Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH) and TOUCH community services provide helpline and counselling services to the general public and youths respectively. These early intervention and upstream support help to reduce suicide ideation and suicide attempts. The National Council of Social Service (NCSS) provided $8.7 million and $5.7 million in funding to Social Service Agencies (SSAs) for mental health support services and counselling programmes respectively in FY18. In addition to funding suicide prevention services, NCSS has launched Belle, an interactive Helpbot to consolidate and provide 24/7 access to information about helplines and mental health services to make it easier for users to seek help when they need it.MOH will continue to work with public hospitals and service providers in the community, including schools, social service agencies and family service centres, to ensure that we provide holistic and timely support for persons with mental healthcare needs.  \"},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mr Heng Swee Keat: The Ministry of Finance recognises the significant challenges faced by firms during this difficult time. As such, various support measures have been introduced through the Unity, Resilience and Solidary Budgets. The Jobs Support Scheme is meant to provide wage support to employers to help them retain their local employees during this period of economic uncertainty. In this regard, all eligible employers who have made CPF contributions for their local employees will qualify for at least 25% wage support. In the Resilience Budget, greater support of up to 75% is provided for sectors that are more significantly and directly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, such as aviation, tourism and food services. In the Solidarity Budget, the support has gone up to 75% for all sectors for the month of April. This has since been extended to include the month of May. In addition, there are also other support for companies.  The economic linkages across firms and sectors are intricate, and hence, many firms have been affected by this unprecedented global pandemic. Some firms, as a matter of strategy, may choose to focus their businesses on a particular customer segment and may, as a result, have higher exposure to the harder-hit sectors.

       "  'answer': \"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: During the current circuit breaker period, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) has implemented several safe distancing measures in the public transport network. All trains and train stations, as well as buses, bus interchanges and bus stops have been marked with safe distancing stickers, wherever practical. This includes marking out seats that should be avoided and where commuters should be standing. Public Transport Operators' (PTOs) Transport Ambassadors (TAs) and bus captains work together with LTA's enforcement officers to help commuters maintain a safe distance from one another.We also require all commuters to wear masks in the public transport network. Errant commuters may be refused entry or asked to leave. Offenders will face fines or prosecution in court.When the circuit breaker measures are lifted and commuter traffic returns, the measures will largely remain in place. The exception is that we will find it very challenging to implement safe distancing in public transport, especially during peak periods. It will therefore be very important for companies to continue to implement staggered working hours and maintain their telecommuting practices as much as possible. Commuters can also play their part to minimise discretionary travel and to travel during off-peak hours when the trains and buses are less crowded.

       "  'answer': 'Mr Desmond Lee: Family Service Centres (FSCs) are community-based social services that support low-income and vulnerable individuals and families to achieve independence, stability and resilience, through social work intervention.The number of social workers in the FSCs has increased over the past few years, from 588 in 2017, 680 in 2018 and to 706 in 2019. This translates to an average of about 15 social workers per FSC in 2019, with the variance depending on the size and needs of the town it serves. FSC caseloads vary across centres and are generally stable from quarter to quarter. The FSCs see an annual average of 350 clients each, with social work practitioners managing an average caseload of 23 in 2017, 25 in 2018 and 22 in 2019. Each FSC distributes the cases among its staff according to the needs of their centre.MSF and NCSS work closely with our FSCs and Social Service Agencies (SSAs), both in normalcy and during challenging periods like COVID-19. During this period, MSF has been in regular contact with FSCs to understand their concerns, and issues advisories to FSCs on the precautionary measures to be taken to cope with the evolving situation. MSF also provides funding to FSCs based on their caseloads, with more funding provided for complex and high-risk cases. This ensures that FSCs have the resources and flexibility to hire more staff when needed. In addition to the support measures announced in the Resilience Budget, FSCs being NCSS member agencies are eligible to claim $3,000 from the Community Chest to help them cope with COVID-19-related expenses. NCSS will also support SSAs in adopting digital tools through the existing VWOs-Charities Capability Fund, and these tools can enable FSCs to continue serving clients remotely during this period. SSAs can also tap on the SG United portal to recruit volunteers to augment their manpower, to support them during this period.We will continue to work closely with the FSCs to support them and their clients during this challenging season.'},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mrs Josephine Teo: The majority of companies in sectors employing nurses, cleaners and security officers are able to offer some form of flexible work arrangements (FWAs) to their employees. In 2018, between seven to nine in 10 companies in these sectors offered formal FWAs1.2Although frontline workers often have to be physically present in their workplaces, employers can still offer FWAs by way of staggering the start and end times of their shifts (i.e. flexi-time), or enabling shifts to be shared by multiple workers (i.e. flexi-load).To help more frontline workers benefit from FWAs, MOM and tripartite partners are developing sector-specific resources and employer support groups to help employers overcome challenges in offering FWAs unique to some sectors. These are in line with recommendations recently made by the Citizens' Panel (CP) on Work-Life Harmony, which comprises diverse participants including business owners and employees.As emphasised by the CP, both employers and employees have a part to play in achieving better work-life harmony. Employers and senior management need to better understand challenges faced by frontline employees, optimise work processes and enhance staff welfare. Employers should also be mindful about giving workers excessive workloads, and respect their workers' rest hours and off days.

       "  'answer': \"16 Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) whether the Council of Board Diversity's latest findings include data on how many existing board members in public-listed companies, statutory boards and IPCs hold more than two board seats across these organisations and, if not, why not; (b) what are the Ministry's plans to achieve the 20-20 vision for at least 20% female representation on boards of public-listed companies by end-2020; (c) whether there should be a higher target than 20% as a First World country; and (d) what are the Ministry's strategic plan and priorities after 2020 for achieving gender equality at home and at work.Mr Desmond Lee: The importance and benefits of having more women on boards and in senior management are well recognised. Indeed, having more women on boards adds to the boards’ diversity in skillsets, experiences and perspectives, thus leading to better decisions. However, while there has been some progress on this front, more needs to be done to quicken the pace. The Council for Board Diversity, or CBD in short, was formed by MSF in 2019 to increase the representation of women on the boards of private, people and public sectors organisations. This is an expanded scope from its predecessor, the Diversity Action Committee, or DAC, which focused on the private sector.CBD has been working towards its 2020 target of achieving 20% women on boards in the top 100 primary-listed companies. The Council has been actively engaging the Chairpersons and Board Members of these companies. To help achieve the 2020 target, MSF is also working with the Council in its engagement efforts and in building a pipeline of board-ready women candidates. The Council’s efforts include collecting data on board renewal so that it can encourage, ahead of time, the organisation concerned to nominate women candidates to be appointed. It encourages organisations, where possible, to consider creating additional positions on their boards so that we can achieve the 20% target sooner rather than wait for the renewal of existing board members.The CBD has been doing good work since it was established and it is on the way towards achieving its 20% target. We have seen an increase in women participation on the boards of the top 100 listed companies, top 100 institutions of public character (IPCs) and Government Statutory Boards. But both MSF and CBD see the need to look beyond this short-term target. As such, we should aim higher. Ultimately, boards should have an approximately equal number of men and women directors. To achieve this, CBD will gradually set higher targets as we progress. For example, CBD has set an interim target for all SGX-companies to have 25% women on boards by end-2025, and 30% women on boards by end-2030. In response to Ms Yip's point on quotas, we note that some may see mandatory quotas as a straightforward means to having more women on boards. Voluntary quotas require a lot more time and effort, as it requires changing mindsets. However, mandatory quotas would not be effective in creating a meaningful increase in the representation of women on boards, as it does not address root causes of the issue. The causes for the low percentage of women on boards are complex and intertwined. It has to do with culture and traditions. Many countries, like the United States and Denmark, face similar challenges.Thus, a multi-stakeholder approach that empowers stakeholders to collaborate and collectively address underlying root causes would be more effective. Moreover, we understand that candidates, both men and women, prefer to be appointed on their own merits, rather than being seen as mandatory 'token' representatives on boards, which would undermine their standing credibility. As the pipeline of board-ready women candidates grows and boards have more candidates to select from, there will be an organic increase in the representation of women on boards based on their own merits. Ms Anthea Ong asked whether the Council has information on how many board members are sitting on more than two boards in public listed companies, statutory boards and IPCs. I assume she is thinking of whether we can restrict the number of boards a person can sit on to allow for more people, especially women, to be appointed.  Such information is available. But I think it is better not to be too restrictive as it may not be helpful to the organic growth that we want to see in the number of women on board by having them appointed on their own merits. If a person has the capacity and the capability, he or she should not be prevented to serve on more than one board.Besides the efforts to get more women on boards, the Government also supports the multiple roles that women play in our society. Women are active in leadership positions at work and in their community. Currently, Singapore is the only ASEAN country with a female Head of State. We have three female full Ministers, several other Political Office Holders and senior Civil Servants, including Permanent Secretaries. We have 24 women Parliamentarians in this Thirteenth Parliament, which is about 24% and about the same as the Inter-Parliamentary Union’s world average of 24.5%. Women also make up half of our public service and Judicial Officers posts in the State and Supreme Courts Our approach is to empower women with choices to pursue their aspirations, be it career, family or both. As such, we will continue eliminating barriers for women at the workplace, in the community and at home. To do so, we need a whole-of-society movement to change mind-sets, attitudes and expectations. Our colleagues at the Ministry of Manpower recently announced plans to enhance the implementation of Flexible Work Arrangements, or FWAs, after hearing from the citizens' panel on work-life harmony. Apart from increasing awareness and facilitating easier adoption of FWAs, MOM will also work on shifting societal norms to make FWA more acceptable.We will continue to encourage the people, private and public sector organisations to work together towards having more women on boards and in leadership positions. \"},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Being an island state, Singapore is vulnerable to sea level rise. Our coastal protection efforts could cost us S$100 billion over the next 50 to 100 years.The S$100 billion cost estimate was based on BCA's Coastal Adaptation Study (CAS) which was commissioned in 2013. The findings referenced the Fourth (AR4) and Fifth (AR5) Assessment Reports from the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as well as Singapore's Second National Climate Change Study published in 2015. These reports did not fully account for the ice-sheet melt in Greenland and the Antarctic as the science then was still nascent.Over the past five years, scientific understanding of this issue has developed significantly and the IPCC released a Special Report on Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) in September 2019. The SROCC found that: global warming has increased the rates of ice loss from ice-sheets and glaciers worldwide, and contributed to accelerated rise in global mean sea levels; global mean sea level is projected to rise by up to 1.1 metres in 2100 (about 0.1 metre higher than the AR5 projections); and historically rare extreme sea level events could occur at least once per year, especially in tropical regions.Scientists from the Centre for Climate Research Singapore (CCRS) have studied the SROCC findings closely and note that sea level rise in tropical areas could be up to 30% higher than the global average. As this is a complex topic, CCRS will be studying this in greater detail under the National Sea Level Research Programme (NSLP). The findings from the NSLP will provide important insights to help strengthen our defences against sea level rise. As part of the Third National Climate Change Study to be completed in 2022, CCRS will develop the new framework for future sea level projections for Singapore, making use of the upcoming Sixth Assessment Report's (AR6) climate projections. This will ensure that CCRS' sea level rise projections are robust and informed by the latest scientific knowledge.PUB, who has been tasked as the national coastal protection agency, will focus on studying our coastal areas, beginning with City-East Coast and Jurong Island, to ascertain the type, feasibility, and extent of protection measures required, and derive detailed cost estimates. To provide for the substantial capital outlay, the Government will set up a Coastal and Flood Protection Fund within PUB, with an initial S$5 billion injection.Other countries are looking at investments of similar or even greater magnitude to protect their coastlines. For example, reports have suggested that the US may need to spend more than US$400 billion between now and 2040 to defend its coastlines. The Netherlands currently commits around 1 billion Euros a year to address flood protection and water supply challenges.Climate science is constantly evolving, and projections of sea level rise will continue to change. Our coastal protection plans will need to be flexible and dynamic to be able to accommodate both future needs and the latest science. The $100 billion is an estimate that could change as science advances. This is a long-term and large-scale effort that the Government will undertake to protect Singapore and Singaporeans.\"},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Between 2015 and 2019, 41 dengue clusters were reported in Bukit Batok East division. The top areas with frequently occurring clusters in the past 5 years include the landed residential estate at Jalan Jurong Kechil / Upper Bukit Timah Road / Chun Tin Road / Yuk Tong Avenue, as well as the public housing estates at Bukit Batok East Avenue 4 / Bukit Batok East Avenue 5 and Toh Guan Road. The largest cluster of 35 dengue cases in that period was reported in the Chun Tin Road/Jalan Jurong Kechil/Yuk Tong Avenue area in November/December 2018. As of 1 April 2020, there were nine clusters in the Bukit Batok East division this year, of which five have closed. The National Environment Agency (NEA) addresses the risk of dengue transmission through a multi-pronged evidence-based approach. This is consistent across all clusters in Singapore, including Bukit Batok East. NEA conducts comprehensive surveillance of the mosquito population through its network of more than 64,000 Gravitraps. This allows NEA to target its vector control operations early and prioritise areas with higher mosquito population. NEA also adopts a preventive approach by conducting regular inspections for potential mosquito breeding habitats, and taking enforcement action against premises owners found to be breeding mosquitoes. NEA works closely with members of the Inter-Agency Dengue Task Force (IADTF), including Town Councils, to step up vector control operations in dengue cluster areas. Dengue cluster alert banners and posters are also put up at the lift lobbies of HDB blocks to heighten residents' awareness on the dengue situation. Residents living in cluster areas are urged to co-operate with NEA officers to allow them to carry out checks for mosquito breeding habitats. Residents can also apply mosquito repellent to protect themselves from mosquito bites, and spray insecticide in dark corners within their homes to kill adult mosquitoes. Since 2019, NEA has published, on the NEA website and myENV app, information on areas with relatively higher Aedes aegypti mosquito population. In February 2020, a total of 103 areas were detected with higher Aedes aegypti mosquito population by NEA's Gravitraps Surveillance System, including one in the Bukit Batok East division. Residents of Bukit Batok East and members of the public are encouraged to subscribe to the notification on dengue clusters and areas with higher Aedes aegypti mosquito population in the myENV app, and do their part to stem dengue transmission.NEA has ongoing educational and publicity campaigns to promote community action to prevent dengue transmission. The annual National Dengue Prevention Campaign was launched on 22 March 2020, to rally the community to fight dengue ahead of the traditional mid-year peak dengue season. NEA also launched the SG Clean campaign to galvanise collective community action to keep our public spaces clean. The SG Clean campaign, which calls on members of public to adopt good public and personal hygiene habits, goes hand in hand with our fight against dengue. For instance, throwing litter into trash bins, to remove potential mosquito breeding habitats. NEA alone cannot prevent dengue transmission in Singapore. NEA has observed a 50% increase in Aedes aegypti mosquito larval breeding habitats found in homes over the past three years, compared to the preceding three years. There is hence an urgent need for all stakeholders and home owners to step up their efforts to eradicate mosquito breeding habitats. Everyone must do their part to protect themselves and their loved ones from dengue.\"},\n",

       "  'question': 'Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Ministry will consider introducing a Tripartite Standard on Gender-Equal Workplace Practices that requires companies to adopt practices such as regular audits of employee wages to ensure gender parity and adequate female representation in key leadership positions.',\n",
       "  'answer': \"Mrs Josephine Teo: MOM has continually adopted policies to encourage fair employment practices that support men and women in our diverse workforce. While well-intended, instituting a Tripartite Standard on Gender-Equal Workplace Practices may not lead to the desired outcomes of gender wage parity or greater representation of females in key leadership positions. Instead, there may be some unintended consequences.For instance, audits of gender pay gaps may lead to firms hesitating to employ lower-wage women as they try to avoid widening gender pay gaps. This could then restrict opportunities for many women in rank and file jobs. Rather than impose a Standard, we need to address the underlying reasons for gender pay gaps and low female representation in leadership roles. One of the root causes lies in current social norms or gender roles. In Asian families, women typically take on the primary role of caring for their children and elderly persons. This affects the amount of time women can spend at work and the extent of their work experience, and hence it impacts their career progression and earnings.Therefore, our policies aim to achieve a more balanced share of caregiving responsibilities by men and women. To reach this goal, we spur the adoption of flexible working arrangements, or FWAs, through the Tripartite Standard on FWAs and Work-Life Grant so that they can better manage their work responsibilities and at the same time fulfil family and personal aspirations. With FWAs, women are better supported to remain in the workforce, gain work experience, earn higher wages and assume leadership roles. In addition, to increase the board representation of women, the Council for Board Diversity, started by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), actively engages Chairpersons and Board Members of private and public sector organisations to encourage the appointment of women candidates.  We have seen encouraging results thus far. Singapore’s adjusted gender pay gap narrowed from 8.8% in 2002 to 6% in 2018. Our women's participation on the boards of the top 100 listed companies increased from 15.2% in 2018 to 16.2% last year.As a society, adjusting social norms can also help men and women achieve greater parity in their roles at home and at work, which is key to reaching greater wage parity and more female representation in key leadership roles.\"},\n",

       "  'question': 'Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Prime Minister whether the Ministry will change the default arrangement of taking paternity leave so that fathers can split the two weeks of paternity leave into working days and take them in any combination within 12 months after the birth of the child without mutual agreement from the employer.',\n",
       "  'answer': \"Mrs Josephine Teo (for the Prime Minister): Fathers play an important role in their children's care and development, as partners to their wives in raising the family. The default arrangement to consume two weeks of paternity leave within 16 weeks after delivery allows fathers to play their part in caring for their newborns, during this time when the family's caregiving load is higher. Without this default arrangement, it may be difficult for fathers to be excused from work for an extended period. The consumption of parental leave in a continuous block soon after birth is also practised in other countries such as France, Spain and the United Kingdom. For those who wish to take it flexibly, the two weeks of paternity leave can already be taken in days within a year from the child's birth, if there is mutual agreement with their employers. This arrangement recognises that fathers have different work arrangements, and balances support for fathers to take their leave flexibly with employers' manpower needs. Beyond leave provisions, the Government encourages and provides support for employers to implement the Tripartite Standards on Flexible Work Arrangements (FWAs) and Unpaid Leave for Unexpected Care Needs, to develop a more family-friendly work culture. Parents may tap on such arrangements to care for their children as well.  We will continue to work with tripartite partners to encourage companies to better support parents in managing their work and family responsibilities, including being understanding when fathers take paternity leave for their caregiving needs.\"},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Malaysia's Movement Control Order has so far not affected our public transport services drastically. First, the number of public transport workers who remain in Malaysia is a very small proportion of the public transport workforce. Most chose to stay and work in Singapore. Second, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and the public transport operators worked overnight to adjust the duty rosters promptly, to respond to the sudden announcement.Since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, public transport ridership has fallen by more than 30%. This is due to individuals and companies responding to Government’s safe distancing measures, which include telecommuting and minimising discretionary travel.As the situation is still evolving, we will continue to work closely with public transport operators to better match supply with demand. If intensified safe distancing measures result in a significant dip in ridership, we will adjust bus and rail capacity, to optimise resource allocation.

Under the CVES, private bus operators who choose lower emissions alternatives for their private buses with maximum laden weight not exceeding 3.5 tonnes can enjoy an incentive of up to $30,000.

       "  'answer': 'Mrs Josephine Teo (for the Prime Minister):  A study commissioned by the National Population and Talent Division in 2019 found that most fathers in Singapore want to use their paternity leave and play a bigger role in child-raising. However, across different types of jobs and companies, a key factor affecting fathers’ utilisation of paternity leave is workplace support from supervisors and colleagues.  The healthy social norm in the Public Service where the majority of fathers (84%) already take paternity leave is self-reinforcing: it helps fathers feel assured about taking paternity leave, and contributes to the high take-up rates in the public sector.1 One of the key reasons for this social norm is that fathers from the public sector generally have supervisors and colleagues who are supportive of them taking paternity leave. A whole-of-society effort is needed to support fathers to be more active in parenting, and to take time-off from work to spend time with their children. We will continue to work with tripartite partners, employers and community partners, to strengthen attitudes and norms in support of fathers taking paternity leave to care for their children.'},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: All hawkers are licensed by the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) and are required to comply with licensing conditions and regulatory requirements. These include maintaining and cleaning their stalls regularly, and having proper infrastructure in place to safely prepare, handle and sell food. Hawkers and their assistants who handle food must also pass the Basic Food Hygiene Course, which equips them with relevant food safety and hygiene knowledge, including proper food handling and good personal hygiene practices. SFA conducts regular inspections to ensure that the regulations are adhered to. The National Environment Agency (NEA) also encourages best practices for the cleaning of hawker centres, such as the use of two separate cloths for table cleaning, as well as sanitising and soaking of cleaning cloths in household bleach at the correct concentration according to manufacturer\\'s instructions. Following the SARS episode in 2003, NEA has also instituted quarterly \"spring cleaning\" for all hawker centres, where hawkers are required to clean up their stalls and the centre is closed for thorough cleaning, such as high pressure jet-wash of the whole centre and cleaning of hard-to-reach surfaces.When COVID-19 cases were first detected in Singapore, NEA and SFA issued joint advisories and stepped up engagement efforts to food establishments, including hawker centres and hawker stalls, to ramp up cleaning efforts and safeguard public health. Last month, the national SG Clean campaign was launched to rally all Singaporeans to keep Singapore clean. As part of the campaign, NEA and SFA introduced sanitation and hygiene checklists for hawker centres and stalls which highlight key practices to safeguard hygiene and reduce contamination risks. Practices include regular cleaning of premises, especially frequent touch points or heavily soiled areas, and sanitisation of food preparation surfaces, utensils and cooking equipment. Hawker centres and stalls that adhere to the checklists will be awarded the \"SG Clean\" quality mark. To date, 19 hawker centres and one in five hawker stalls have been certified \"SG Clean\". We will audit all hawker centres and stalls for the \"SG Clean\" quality mark standards by this year.Every Singaporean must also play our part to keep Singapore clean in our battle against COVID-19. As individuals, we should continue to practise good personal hygiene and responsibility like frequent handwashing and temperature monitoring.

The average attendance for the past two editions has been about 50,000 attendees each year. SIFA's strength in curating and showcasing high-quality artistic works has culminated in a 17% increase in returning visitors to SIFA in 2019 as compared to the previous year based on audiences surveyed.As articulated by the National Arts Council in Our SG Arts Plan (2018 to 2022), growing audiences is a key priority area for the development of Singapore's arts landscape. For SIFA, close to half (47%) of the audiences surveyed last year were first time patrons, of which 70% were Singapore residents – this is heartening and we would like to see more Singaporeans attend SIFA or an arts event. SIFA will continue to present interesting programmes and experiences that can reach people from all backgrounds to attend this national event.

To-date, more than SGD 6.5 billion of green bonds have been issued in Singapore.Over the years, we monitored the take-up of the grant, reviewed and refined the scheme. In February 2019, MAS lowered the minimum issuance size from SGD 200 million to SGD 20 million to support more issuers, including medium-sized enterprises. MAS also expanded the scope of the scheme to include social and sustainability bonds and renamed it the Sustainable Bond Grant Scheme. Even with changes to the scheme, issuers of green bonds are still required to have in place a green bond framework based on internationally accepted principles – governing the use of proceeds, the evaluation and selection of projects, and reporting on the allocation of proceeds to eligible projects. Issuers are also required to obtain independent external reviews1 to assure investors that their frameworks are robust and not subject to \"greenwashing\", where unsubstantiated or false claims on the environmental contribution of one\\'s products, services or business activities are made.

       "  'answer': \"Mr Desmond Lee: Today, many young children with developmental needs are enrolled in a preschool. Three-quarters of children aged five to six who are enrolled in the Early Intervention Programme for Infants & Children (EIPIC) are also enrolled in preschools.There is a range of support available within preschools for children with developmental needs. For example, about 550 preschools offer the Learning Support and Development Support programmes, which cater to children with learning and mild developmental needs respectively. However, some preschools may find it challenging to cater to a child with moderate to severe developmental needs. The Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) receives feedback on a few such cases per year. Where needed, ECDA works with parents and stakeholders such as SG Enable, EIPIC centres and preschools to find a solution that meets the needs of the child. This includes engaging the parents and the preschools to better understand the child's needs, and arranging for the preschools to work with EIPIC centres to adopt appropriate strategies to support the child. ECDA may also refer the child to suitable preschools which are better placed to support the child’s development. The Government is continuing to enhance support for children with developmental needs in preschools. For example, we introduced the Development Support-Plus (DS-Plus) programme last year to cater to children who have made sufficient progress under EIPIC and are able to transit to receiving intervention in a preschool setting with added support. Under DS-Plus, early intervention professionals from EIPIC centres work with the child in his or her preschool up to twice a week, co-teaching the child alongside the preschool teacher. We have also set up the Inclusive Preschool Workgroup, which will develop recommendations on how to better support children with moderate to severe developmental needs in preschools.\"},\n",

In 2015, NEA issued legal notices under the THPA to six companies to take immediate measures to stop the fires that caused haze that affected Singapore. Two of the companies responded and explained that they were no longer associated with the affected lands. Upon further investigation, NEA accepted their explanation and closed these two cases. The cases against the other four companies are still open. If the directors of the relevant companies enter Singapore, they will be required to assist in our investigations. Action will also be taken against one of the directors who has an outstanding court warrant against him.The THPA is not a panacea or the only tool to fight transboundary haze.

       "  'answer': \"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Singapore's Climate Action Plan outlines our climate mitigation strategies across key sectors – namely, the power, industry, transport, buildings, households, and waste and water sectors. Improving energy efficiency is a key strategy that not only contributes to emission reductions, but also enhances companies' long-term business competitiveness.The Energy Efficiency National Partnership (EENP) launched by the National Environment Agency (NEA) in 2010, aims to support companies in their energy efficiency efforts. The EENP is a voluntary, industry-focused programme, in partnership with the NEA, the Economic Development Board and the Energy Market Authority. As of January 2020, 302 companies have joined the programme. As part of the EENP's learning network, NEA organises the biennial National Energy Efficiency Conference. Companies, organisations and individuals are also recognised for their achievements in energy management through the annual EENP Awards. These platforms allow companies to share best practices and promote the adoption of energy efficient technologies. The Government also works closely with industry-led work groups such as the Singapore Chemical Industry Council Industry Sustainability Committee, the Biopharmaceutical Manufacturers Advisory Committee and the Food Manufacturing Energy Efficiency Committee to support companies in energy efficiency improvement.The manufacturing sector in particular is heterogeneous, with varied manufacturing processes and bespoke equipment and systems. In addition to setting energy efficiency standards for common industrial systems and equipment, NEA analyses the energy performance of systems and equipment of more than 180 energy-intensive companies regulated under the Energy Conservation Act and shares the findings with individual companies, as benchmarked against others in their respective manufacturing sub-sectors.Climate action requires collective action from all stakeholders.

       "  'answer': \"Mrs Josephine Teo: A big majority of the Chinese work pass holders who travelled to China over the new year period have yet to return to Singapore. This is because of MOM's strict requirement for their employers to seek prior approval, to ensure an orderly flow and enable effective enforcement of the Stay-Home Notices (SHN) upon arrival. An average of 220 applications have been approved daily. Upon their return, all the workers are expected to serve the SHN. Those found to have wilfully flouted the SHN have had their work passes revoked and permanently banned from working in Singapore. Employers who were non-compliant have also had their work pass privileges suspended.Among those who have not returned, an estimated 25% stay in HDB units while 75% stay in other accommodation including dormitories and private residences.In line with the advice from the public health professionals, persons who are on SHN need not be segregated. Nevertheless, MOM informed dormitory operators to take additional precautionary measures to minimise contact between persons on SHN and their other residents. Residents on SHN would thus reside in a section of the dormitory that is separate from the other residents. Food and daily necessities are provided so that there is no need for them to leave their room, except to seek medical attention.Apart from specific measures for residents on SHN, MOM has also advised dormitory operators to cease mass activities, stagger the use of common facilities, and manage residents who have mild flu-like symptoms by isolating them and seeking medical attention immediately.\"},\n",

As mentioned in a recent response to Mr Louis Ng's Parliamentary Question on barriers to fathers taking paternity leave, our research showed that fathers' utilisation of paternity leave is dependent on workplace support, especially from supervisors and colleagues. As such, giving fathers additional leave may not help to raise the take-up rate of paternity leave. Instead, it is especially important for us to work together to shape more supportive workplace norms and culture for parents. When considering further enhancements to leave schemes, we also have to balance support for parents with employers’ concerns over manpower needs at the workplace.

Under the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change (IMCCC), various government agencies are involved in implementing a series of sectoral mitigation measures to enable Singapore to meet our climate commitments. For example, the Building and Construction Authority's (BCA) initiatives under the Green Building Masterplan will accelerate the proliferation of green buildings. This will help Singapore become an even more sustainable and highly liveable city.The public sector itself is taking concrete steps to lead in the adoption of sustainable practices and initiatives. This is coordinated through the Public Sector Taking the Lead in Environmental Sustainability (PSTLES) initiative, which was introduced in 2006 and updated in 2017. PSTLES serves as a platform to leverage the collective capabilities across the Whole-of-Government (WOG) to improve resource efficiency in the public sector and effect our commitment towards environmental sustainability.Under PSTLES, the SolarNova Programme aggregates demand for solar deployment across public sector buildings and spaces, catalysing solar adoption in Singapore. For example, HDB's target to deploy 540 Megawatt peak (MWp) of solar on the rooftops of HDB blocks will make up a significant proportion of our national target to deploy at least 2 Gigawatt peak (GWp) of solar deployment by 2030.Under the PSTLES initiative, the Government has set targets to reduce our electricity and water consumption, achieve Green Mark standards for our buildings, procure green electronics and paper products, and hold events and functions in venues with at least a Green Mark certified rating.We intend to raise our ambition for the next phase of the PSTLES initiative. More details will be announced later this year.Key efforts in environmental sustainability undertaken by government agencies are reported in the biennial publication – Singapore Public Sector Outcomes Review (SPOR). The publication takes stock of how Singapore has fared in addressing climate change, water and energy usage, and waste management, amongst other government programmes.

When the Police receive a report of attempted suicide, the nearest available resource will be dispatched to respond quickly to the case. If medical intervention is needed, the SCDF will also send the nearest available ambulance to the scene. If you want specialised \"mental health ambulances\" then you will have to have these in sufficient numbers to respond immediately to cases at any part of the island. That would not be a sensible approach. The right approach is to quickly get to such persons, with the use of normal ambulances, and make sure they get care. They can receive specialised mental healthcare thereafter. All Police officers receive training on how to manage cases involving individuals who are mentally distressed or traumatised. They also undergo regular refreshers through after-action reviews of such incidents.Where necessary, the frontline officers will activate additional resources to assist with the case such as SCDF\\'s Disaster Assistance and Rescue Teams (DART) and the Police’s Crisis Negotiation Unit (CNU).

       "  'answer': \"Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): Meeting Singapore's climate commitments requires a whole-of-nation effort. Under the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change (IMCCC), various government agencies are involved in implementing a series of sectoral mitigation measures to enable Singapore to meet our climate commitments. For example, the Building and Construction Authority's (BCA) initiatives under the Green Building Masterplan will accelerate the proliferation of green buildings. This will help Singapore become an even more sustainable and highly liveable city.The public sector itself is taking concrete steps to lead in the adoption of sustainable practices and initiatives. This is coordinated through the Public Sector Taking the Lead in Environmental Sustainability (PSTLES) initiative, which was introduced in 2006 and updated in 2017. PSTLES serves as a platform to leverage the collective capabilities across the Whole-of-Government (WOG) to improve resource efficiency in the public sector and effect our commitment towards environmental sustainability.Under PSTLES, the SolarNova Programme aggregates demand for solar deployment across public sector buildings and spaces, catalysing solar adoption in Singapore. For example, HDB's target to deploy 540 Megawatt peak (MWp) of solar on the rooftops of HDB blocks will make up a significant proportion of our national target to deploy at least 2 Gigawatt peak (GWp) of solar deployment by 2030.Under the PSTLES initiative, the Government has set targets to reduce our electricity and water consumption, achieve Green Mark standards for our buildings, procure green electronics and paper products, and hold events and functions in venues with at least a Green Mark certified rating.We intend to raise our ambition for the next phase of the PSTLES initiative. More details will be announced later this year.Key efforts in environmental sustainability undertaken by government agencies are reported in the biennial publication – Singapore Public Sector Outcomes Review (SPOR). The publication takes stock of how Singapore has fared in addressing climate change, water and energy usage, and waste management, amongst other government programmes. In the light of these efforts, there is no need to require the Ministries to produce a climate compliance certificate.\"},\n",

When the Police receive a report of attempted suicide, the nearest available resource will be dispatched to respond quickly to the case. If medical intervention is needed, the SCDF will also send the nearest available ambulance to the scene. If you want specialised \"mental health ambulances\" then you will have to have these in sufficient numbers to respond immediately to cases at any part of the island. That would not be a sensible approach. The right approach is to quickly get to such persons, with the use of normal ambulances, and make sure they get care. They can receive specialised mental healthcare thereafter. All Police officers receive training on how to manage cases involving individuals who are mentally distressed or traumatised. They also undergo regular refreshers through after-action reviews of such incidents.Where necessary, the frontline officers will activate additional resources to assist with the case such as SCDF\\'s Disaster Assistance and Rescue Teams (DART) and the Police’s Crisis Negotiation Unit (CNU). DART is specially trained for complex rescue operations, including cases of attempted suicide at height and in confined spaces.

This is to ensure that the emissions from WTE plants comply with emission standards specified under the Environmental Protection and Management (Air Impurities) Regulations. These standards cover key pollutants associated with the incineration of plastics waste, such as carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, as well as dioxins and furans. Under the Environmental Protection and Management Act (EPMA), operators who fail to meet the specified standards can be fined up to $20,000 on the first conviction and up to $50,000 on the second or subsequent conviction. To complement emissions testing, NEA inspects WTE plants twice a year to verify that pollution control equipment are properly maintained and operating effectively.Singapore's emission standards are published as part of the Environmental Protection and Management (Air Impurities) Regulations under the EPMA.

       "  'answer': 'Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: As of 22 February 2020, there were 110 active dengue clusters. Since the start of the year, a total of 2,894 dengue cases have been reported, with 386 cases reported in the week ending 22 February. The number of Dengue virus serotype 3 (DENV-3) cases has risen over the last three months. The monthly proportion of DENV-3 cases in January was approximately 46%, higher than the proportion of Dengue virus serotype 2 cases at 40%. We are watching very closely whether there is a potential for a serotype switch. Such a switch is historically associated with dengue outbreaks. Singapore has not had a dengue outbreak driven by DENV-3 in over two decades, hence our population’s immunity to DENV-3 is low. The National Environment Agency (NEA) is monitoring this closely.NEA, together with Inter-Agency Dengue Task Force partners and Town Councils, has stepped up inspections to remove potential mosquito breeding habitats. Community volunteers and grassroots leaders have also been working hard to raise awareness on dengue prevention. Of the 346 clusters notified this year, nearly 70% have been closed, with the cooperation of our partners and the community.NEA has made available information on dengue clusters and areas with high Aedes aegypti mosquito population on the NEA website and myENV app. These are useful indicators to encourage early intervention, heighten community awareness to the risk of dengue transmission, and facilitate targeted action by stakeholders and residents. From January 2020, NEA started distributing flyers to alert residents living in areas with high Aedes aegypti mosquito population. Dengue cluster alert banners have also been put up in cluster areas to update the residents and members of the public of the latest dengue situation within the precinct.In view of the dengue outlook for 2020, NEA will bring forward the launch of the annual National Dengue Prevention Campaign to March, ahead of the traditional mid-year peak dengue season. Together with grassroots leaders and Dengue Prevention Volunteers, NEA will embark on intensive nationwide outreach efforts. NEA does outreach to elderly at neighbourhood elderly corners using customised, vernacular-language videos. NEA also works with preschools and schools to provide dengue prevention materials depicting the life cycle of the Aedes mosquito, which also serves as a teaching aid.But NEA alone cannot prevent dengue transmission in Singapore. 60% of mosquito breeding habitats detected continue to be found in residential premises. In addition to doing the Mozzie Wipeout, residents, especially those living in dengue clusters or areas with high mosquito population, are advised to regularly spray insecticide inside their homes, targeting dark areas where adult mosquitoes are likely to be resting. Young and old, there is an urgent need for everyone to step up their efforts to eradicate mosquito breeding habitats together with community partners and NGOs.

There are 14 SHs licensed under the Homes for the Aged Act. We do not track residents' age at admission to SHs. Based on a recent survey conducted in 2019 on SHs which are funded by the Ministry of Social and Family Development, the average age at admission was 72 years; and the average length of stay was about six years. The gender ratio of residents in SHs is about one male to one female. There are no immediate plans to set up more SHs as the occupancy rate has been relatively stable.Not every senior requires the services and close supervision provided by SHs. Most seniors prefer to grow old where they live, and with or close to their loved ones. To enable seniors to age in the community, there are other housing options such as senior group homes which provide assisted living in public rental flats for seniors with mild care needs.

Employers who fail to issue KETs or issue an incomplete set of KETs may be subject to an administrative penalty of a fine up to $400 for each breach. Uncooperative employers will also be directed to rectify the breaches and failure to abide by the direction will be a criminal offence. A 2019 survey by MOM found that 98% of employees worked in private establishments that issued written KETs. This is consistent with our enforcement findings. The Ministry also ensures that the employment rights of workers are protected even if they are not given KETs by their employers.

If the employer fails to prove either of the two requirements, the original declared salary holds and the employer will be required to make good any salary shortfall, regardless of reason for the salary reduction. In addition, MOM will also impose a fine of up to $10,000 per worker on the employer.The requirement for employers to obtain their workers' written agreement ensures that the WPH can refuse to give his consent. WPHs whose contracts are terminated by their employer for refusing to provide consent should seek help from MOM. MOM allows such WPHs to find a new employer and we work with the Migrant Workers’ Centre to facilitate the process.The suggestion by the Member to make employers declare the reason for the salary reduction when notifying MOM is redundant. Even if the employer did so, he would still need to obtain the written agreement of the WPH.

Across different types of jobs and companies, the key factor affecting fathers' utilisation of paternity leave is workplace support. This includes whether supervisors are adequately assuring that using paternity leave will not affect fathers' career prospects and that colleagues are willing to cover fathers' duties in their absence. The influence of workplace norms on paternity leave take-up is similar to other East Asian societies, such as South Korea and Japan, where take-up rates of paternity leave are less than 10%.1Even though workplace norms take time to change, we have seen encouraging progress. Our paternity leave take-up rate has risen from 25% in 20132 to 53% in recent cohorts. In the public sector, the majority of fathers (84%) take paternity leave. Even in Nordic countries where paternity leave has been implemented much earlier, the take-up rates are around 70% to 80%.3 More employers in Singapore are also adopting the Tripartite Standards on Flexible Work Arrangements and Unpaid Leave for Unexpected Care Needs, to support their employees in managing their work and family responsibilities.A whole-of-society effort is needed for fathers to feel supported in taking time-off from work to spend time with their children.

Through our consultations, tripartite partners recognise that there is a need to retain the flexibility to renegotiate employment terms, including making salary revisions to reflect the demonstrated performance of the worker. Disallowing downward revisions of salary entirely will leave the employer with no other option except to terminate the employment of a non-performing worker.

Such approaches that cut costs to save jobs would no longer be possible if the Member's suggestion is adopted. Given the feedback from tripartite partners, the Ministry has decided to retain the flexibility for employers to revise the salaries of their foreign workers. We will continue to focus on protecting the interests of foreign workers by strongly enforcing against employers who reduce their workers' salaries without their agreement. When there are disputes involving salary reduction, the onus is on the employers to declare and substantiate their reasons for the salary reduction. The Ministry of Manpower's (MOM) actions against errant employers include requiring them to make good any salary shortfall to the workers and imposing a fine of up to $10,000 per worker. In 2019, we imposed a total of $488,000 in administrative financial penalties on 68 employers. MOM also allows such workers to be transferred to a new employer.\"},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr K Shanmugam: The Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) has put in place many preventive drug education (PDE) programmes targeted at youths. CNB also reaches out to youths through persons in positions of influence like parents, counsellors, educators, youth advocates, community leaders and National Service commanders, so that they can also help to advise the youths.A key touchpoint is the school setting. In January 2019, CNB launched a new exhibition for schools, incorporating Augmented Reality (AR), to give students a more immersive experience on the harms of drugs. CNB has reached out to close to 3,000 students so far, and received good feedback.Another initiative launched in August 2019 in collaboration with MOE is the After-School Engagement (ASE) programme, targeted at vulnerable and at-risk students.1 The ASE programme is an additional platform for students to learn about the harms of drug abuse and its consequences, through activities such as sharing by former drug abusers.Social media is another key platform. CNB regularly publishes on its social media, content about drugs. For example, it has pushed out a series of bite-sized infographics to explain the harmful effects of cannabis and the cost to society of cannabis legalisation, to de-bunk the misinformation surrounding cannabis.CNB also equips staff of community agencies such as the Ministry of Social and Family Development\\'s (MSF) Boys\\' and Girls\\' Homes, Youth Centres supported by MSF, self-help groups and Social Service Agencies (SSAs) such as Fei Yue Family Service Centre and Care Corner Singapore Ltd, with knowledge of the tell-tale signs and behavioural changes of abusers. This facilitates the agencies\\' work when managing youths under their charge, and enables them to surface potential abusers for early intervention.CNB has also been working with the National Council Against Drug Abuse (NCADA). NCADA will be launching a media campaign in March 2020, built around Singapore\\'s first interactive film \"HIGH\" directed by local filmmaker Royston Tan. The purpose of this campaign is to engage youths in conversations around drug abuse and anti-drug advocacy.CNB and NCADA engage community partners and volunteers through the United Against Drugs Coalition (UADC) and Anti-Drug Abuse Advocacy (A3) Network to amplify and strengthen anti-drug narratives.2 So far, CNB has recruited 162 youth advocates under the A3 Network. Last but not least, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and MSF co-chair the National Committee on Prevention, Rehabilitation and Recidivism (NCPR), which was set up to coordinate efforts in research, rehabilitation, as well as to address offending and re-offending, among at-risk children and youths, offenders and their families.'},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Dr Vivian Balakrishnan: Singapore established formal diplomatic relations with China on 3 October 1990. We have a close, vital and multifaceted relationship with China involving our leaders, our corporate sector and at the people-to-people level in many fields including education, science and culture. Consequently, we have many frequent high-level exchanges, institutionalised platforms and substantive cooperation all across China. The Government-to-Government projects at the 1994 China-Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park; the 2008 Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City; and the 2015 Chongqing Connectivity Initiative are icons of success that reflect Singapore\\'s complementary roles at various phases of China\\'s spectacular development. We share deep economic relations. China has been Singapore\\'s largest trading partner and Singapore has been China\\'s largest foreign investor since 2013. Singapore and China are commemorating the 30th anniversary of Singapore-China diplomatic relations this year in the face of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. China has borne the brunt of the impact of the epidemic. The Singapore Government, our business community, as well as our people have come together to offer support to a friend in need by donating funds, some critically needed test kits and medical supplies to support communities in China which have been severely affected by COVID-19. As of 25 February 2020, the Singapore Red Cross has raised more than S$6 million. This is a reflection of concern for our Chinese friends and our solidarity with China and the international community to fight the virus, understand the disease, and prevent its further spread. We are confident that through close cooperation, Singapore, China, and the international community will ultimately overcome this challenge. I have just returned from attending a Special ASEAN-China Foreign Ministers\\' Meeting on COVID-19 in Vientiane, Laos where I also had a bilateral meeting with Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi. He thanked me for Singapore\\'s encouragement and support during this challenging period for China. We reaffirmed the strong, multifaceted and mutually beneficial partnership between Singapore and China and discussed new areas of cooperation, including in enhancing public health. As part of our commemoration of 30 years of diplomatic ties between Singapore and China, we have planned a number of high-level exchanges this year. President Halimah Yacob has accepted President Xi Jinping\\'s invitation to make a State Visit to China, while Singapore will host the 16th Joint Council for Bilateral Cooperation (JCBC), our apex institutionalised platform, co-chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat and Chinese Vice Premier Han Zheng, to advance bilateral cooperation. The 30th anniversary also coincides with the anniversaries of some of our key projects in China. This includes the 5th anniversary of the Chongqing Connectivity Initiative – our third Government-to-Government project – as well as the 10th anniversary of the China-Singapore Guangzhou Knowledge City, a state-level bilateral cooperation project. We will expand cooperation in existing and new areas, such as the Belt and Road Initiative and smart city development. Both sides have also planned activities that will highlight our close cultural ties, such as an exhibition of the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM)\\'s Tang Shipwreck Collection at the Shanghai Museum, which will showcase the longstanding links between Singapore and China, as well as the region along the maritime silk routes. ACM will also present an exhibition in Singapore titled \"Yongle.Wanli – Emperors of the Ming\", with the spotlight on China\\'s Ming Dynasty and featuring artifacts loaned from the Palace Museum in Beijing. Such exchanges will further promote mutual understanding and enhance people-to-people ties, and we look forward to many years of close cooperation between Singapore and China.'},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Lawrence Wong (for the Prime Minister): Singapore has faced several infectious disease outbreaks since SARS in 2003, including H1N1, Zika, and most recently Monkeypox. Many lessons have been drawn from these past experiences to improve our readiness for the next outbreak. Over the years, we have strengthened our epidemiological surveillance and containment capabilities, and held regular emergency preparedness exercises to keep ourselves operationally ready. The setting up of the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) has enhanced our infrastructure and capabilities to manage a disease outbreak in Singapore.When COVID-19 emerged, we alerted all our healthcare institutions and put in place precautionary measures according to our response plans. Even before Singapore had its first confirmed case, we anticipated that we would need a Whole-of-Government effort to respond effectively to this threat and we set up the Multi-Ministry Taskforce on 22 January 2020 to coordinate our responses and measures. Since then, the Taskforce has put in place in place a whole range of measures from border controls to extra precautions within Singapore. We will continue to monitor the situation and take more measures when necessary. We recognise that an important part of our system of defence is the role that every individual plays, by exercising social responsibility, practising good personal hygiene, and supporting our fellow citizens, especially our healthcare workers on the frontline. We must not let our fears overwhelm us and cause us to behave irrationally, selfishly or irresponsibly. Instead, let us support and look out for one another, so that we can all get through this together and emerge stronger.  It is also important not to spread unverified information or false news which can cause panic and fear. The Government has and will continue to push timely information through various platforms including broadcast media, display panels in HDB estates, websites and social media, so that Singaporeans can easily refer to these authoritative sources for news, health advisories and the latest updates.  The Government has also taken proactive steps to secure essential supplies, including masks. In peacetime, we had built up a stockpile of surgical and N95 masks. As we draw down on this stockpile, we will also need to replenish it with new supplies. In recent weeks, some places like Taiwan, Thailand and India have banned or tightened regulations on the export of masks. We are therefore strengthening the resilience of our supply chain, including looking for new sources, and developing local manufacturing capabilities.We will continue to do everything we can, to keep Singaporeans safe, and to overcome this challenging situation together.'},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mr K Shanmugam: We have strengthened the law to enhance protection for children against sexual offences. The amendments to the Penal Code came into effect on 1 January 2020. In particular, the threshold for the offence of sexual grooming has been lowered, by reducing from two to one, the number of instances of prior contact between the offender and the child needed to make out the offence. Another amendment is the reduction of the age floor below which an offender cannot be charged for the offence of sexual grooming, from 21 to 18 years of age. In addition, new offences were introduced, for example, to criminalise sexual communication with a minor or showing a minor a sexual image. This allows authorities to intervene earlier, before the offender is able to commit additional and more serious sexual offences.The Government has taken steps on various fronts to raise public awareness of the risks associated with the use of the Internet and social media. Through MOE's Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) programme, students learn about the harmful and criminal exploitation of the internet and how to protect themselves. MCI, on its part, has been strengthening digital literacy in Singapore. In July 2019, the Digital Media and Information Literacy Framework was launched to deepen Singaporeans' appreciation of the benefits and risks of digital technologies and information. MCI's partner agencies and programme owners, such as NLB, have incorporated this framework into their programmes. Police do not track statistics on the number of sexual assault cases involving children, broken down by the type of housing in which the crime was committed. We take a serious view of sexual assault against all children, regardless of where it takes place. \"},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mr Chan Chun Sing: The Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) uses a range of grant and tax incentives to attract investments into Singapore. These are compliant with the World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules, as well as with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) rules to address base erosion and profit shifting. The value of incentives awarded is a fraction of the projected total investment. Tax incentives are notional, and do not erode the tax base from existing activities. In addition, if a tax incentive recipient is not profitable, it will not enjoy any benefit. Other incentives such as training or research and development (R&D) grants are modest. Moreover, these grants are administered on a reimbursement basis. In other words, if the grant recipient does not incur the expenditure, it will not receive the grant.  The number of jobs created are new jobs linked to new and expansion projects committed in that particular year. It is not meaningful to hypothesise the investments into Singapore absent these incentives. Competition for these investments is intensifying, and we must continue to remain globally competitive and an investment destination of choice. Doing so requires us to go beyond incentives, to strengthen our fundamentals such as our strong rule of law, pro-business environment, physical and data connectivity, and access to skilled talent. MTI will continue to do so, to grow our economy and better Singaporeans' lives.\"},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: For our 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), we have pledged to reduce our emissions intensity (emissions per dollar GDP) by 36% from 2005 levels by 2030, and to stabilise emissions with the aim of peaking around 2030. Given expected growth in economic activity and increased energy demand, Singapore's greenhouse gas emissions are projected to rise over the next few years before stabilising. Short-term year-on-year emissions projections may be affected by a multitude of factors such as unforeseen disruptions, and are thus not a good reflection of the emissions trajectory.To achieve our 2030 NDC, the Government is putting in place mitigation measures to reduce emissions across all sectors, such as the industry, transport and building sectors, and ensure that Singapore continues to develop in a sustainable manner. The carbon tax is not standalone. It forms part of our comprehensive suite of mitigation measures. It provides an important economy-wide price signal to spur emissions reduction, while giving companies the flexibility to take action where it makes the most business sense. The Government is prepared to spend more than the expected carbon tax revenue of about $1 billion over the first five years to help companies improve their energy and carbon efficiency. As such, it is more meaningful to monitor the progress and impact of our mitigation package as a whole. \"},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: \"Virtual\" food businesses, also known as \"cloud kitchens\", are food establishments that do not have a physical store front but sell food directly to consumers through online food delivery platforms. They are licensed by the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) under the Environmental Public Health Act. There were 61 of such food businesses as of 31 January 2020.Just like any other food establishment, \"virtual\" food businesses must comply with SFA\\'s food safety requirements and standards, and ensure that the food they prepare is safe to eat. For instance, their food handlers and food hygiene officers must all be trained and certified under the Basic Food Hygiene Course and the Workforce Skills Qualifications\\' \"Conduct Food & Beverages Hygiene Audit\" programme respectively. These \"virtual\" food businesses are also subjected to inspection and enforcement actions by SFA just like other food establishments. Since \"virtual\" food businesses started being licensed in 2017, there has been one food hygiene and safety offence committed which involved an unregistered food handler.

       "  'answer': 'Mr Khaw Boon Wan: In November 2018, LTA introduced e-notifications for vehicle-related transactions such as road tax renewals to provide vehicle owners with timely and convenient updates. To ensure reasonable notice, vehicle owners are sent notice of renewals one month ahead of the expiry date. Subsequent electronic reminders are issued seven days and three days before road tax expiry. These reminders are issued via hardcopy letters to vehicle owners who prefer physical notifications. It is an offence for vehicle owners to fail to renew their road tax on time. Since the introduction of e-notifications, the number of such offences has decreased from 7.3% in 2018 to 6.9% in 2019.  We have no plans to withdraw the offence of non-renewal of road tax, which ensures compliance with the road tax regime.

       "  'answer': \"Mrs Josephine Teo: With greater awareness following the global #MeToo movement in late 2017, and TAFEP's establishment of a help & resource centre for managing workplace harassment in 2019, we have seen more reports of workplace harassment where employers have been the subject of such complaints.In each of these cases, the employer had not properly followed up on allegations of workplace harassment. TAFEP engaged the employer to educate and ensure they implement measures in the Tripartite Advisory on Managing Workplace Harassment, including asking the employer to re-investigate the complaint, where necessary. Specifically in one of these 22 cases, as the employer was alleged to have verbally harassed the complainant, TAFEP additionally advised the employer to be more mindful of his behaviour and respectful when engaging his staff. So far, all the employers that TAFEP engaged have been cooperative and receptive to their advice.A watchlist allows MOM to monitor specific workforce metrics of employers suspected of errant behaviours to see if they have improved their employment practices. However, workplace harassment complaints typically involve specific incidents and persons. There are no clearly identifiable metrics to monitor. A watchlist approach is therefore impractical. Instead, MOM's policy is to revoke the work pass privileges of egregious offenders, such as employers who fail to provide a safe environment for employees or refuse to improve their grievance handling processes.

This is because parents are more willing to send their children to primary schools near their homes, instead of popular schools. To the Member's specific question, across our 17 schools that offer IP, there is considerable variation in terms of which are their three highest-contributing primary schools. On average, these primary schools account for 24% of IP schools' admission, falling from 27% in 2019 and 28% in 2018.  Our IP schools are taking active steps to ensure that they remain accessible to deserving students from all primary schools, including through the Direct School Admission scheme. IP schools also undertake individual efforts to increase diversity in admissions, from enhancing their school-based awards to reaching out to the community.\"},\n",

However, the Government will continue to track data on attempted suicide that are made known to us.The Member suggested tapping on first-aiders to help in cases of attempted suicide. SGSecure Responder is an initiative to alert community responders to fire and cardiac arrest cases. It is much more challenging for community responders to intervene in attempted suicide cases due to their complexity. Members of the public should continue to call the Police or the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF).The Member also suggested specialised emergency response for suicide cases. That may not be feasible. We have SPF and SCDF officers who are trained to intervene in suicide attempts, and they will be mobilised when such cases are reported. The SPF's Crisis Negotiation Unit will also help where necessary. The SCDF's Disaster Assistance and Rescue Teams (DART) are specially trained for complex rescue operations, including cases of attempted suicide at height and in confined spaces.

       "  'answer': \"Mr Desmond Lee (for the Prime Minister): The Singapore Bicentennial commemoration was a success. There were more than 250 events held in 2019, mostly organised by the community. The total visitorship was more than 9 million, with many attending more than one event. We also worked with 340 community partners and more than 3,500 volunteers, reflecting the broad support for the commemoration.Expenditure on The Bicentennial Experience at Fort Canning was about $35.5 million, of which $23 million was for the original run, and $11 million for the three-month extension due to overwhelming public demand. Just under $1.5 million was for conferences and books that explored Singapore's longer history. The commemoration also leveraged several existing annual events (e.g. iLight Singapore Bicentennial Edition, Singapore Night Festival) which were enhanced to feature the bicentennial themes.We received positive feedback from those who attended the various Singapore Bicentennial events. Many visitors appreciated the importance of reflecting on our past, in order to glean lessons for our future. Response to The Bicentennial Experience was particularly good. It was the first time that a large-scale exposition on Singapore's history had attracted such strong interest from over 760,000 visitors. In particular, younger Singaporeans including almost 20,000 NSFs and 105,000 students and pre-schoolers, came on learning journeys with their school teachers. More than 96% rated The Bicentennial Experience 'Good' and 'Very Good', reflecting the breakthrough in storytelling that benefits the visitors and offers lessons for other institutions to reference. About 93% said that it had increased their knowledge of Singapore’s history, and offered lessons for our future.The positive outcomes from this, and other community events, cannot all be quantified. For example, our community partners also felt that the Singapore Bicentennial commemoration provided a meaningful platform to showcase their community's history and origins, as well as to examine different aspects of Singapore's past. Many of their events engaged new audiences. Much of the new content created has also made different aspects of our longer history more accessible to the public, and will enrich our archives for future generations of Singaporeans.We would like to thank our community partners and volunteers for their support throughout the bicentennial year.\"},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mrs Josephine Teo: The Ministry of Manpower supports workers seeking membership in a union registered with the Registry of Trade Unions. They can benefit from union support and representation, in areas such as training and upskilling, collective bargaining and dispute resolution.  However, it would be inappropriate to insist as a condition of Government contracts, that the contractors' workers be union members. Such a condition could lead to perverse outcomes. For example, a contractor may feel compelled to terminate a worker on account of his preference not to be a union member, in order to be eligible to bid for government contracts. To avoid unemployment, a worker may then feel compelled to join the union. This goes against the fundamental right of a worker to decide on union membership.The Government recognises unionised companies in other ways. For instance, companies can tap on an extra 10 per cent in funding support through the Enterprise Development Grant, if they work with unions to train workers as the companies' jobs transform. We also support unionised companies' efforts to be more progressive employers, through engagement programmes organised by the tripartite partners.\"},\n",

MediShield Life provides additional coverage should they require an inpatient stay, and MediSave withdrawals can be made to offset the remaining cost of their bills. From 2016 to 2018, an average of 4,400 MediShield Life claims were approved and about $4 million paid out each year for inpatient psychiatric treatments. As MediShield Life is meant to cover medically necessary treatments for subsidised patients, the claim limit does not take into account patients with longer period of stays that may generally be due to social reasons. Among subsidised patients, around two in 10 exceeded the 35-day cap, and another four in 10 were within the 35-day cap but exceeded the $100 per day limit. About 300 claims each year are excluded from coverage as they are for treatment of injuries resulting from attempted suicide.Over the same period, an average of 4,800 patients withdrew about $6 million from MediSave for inpatient psychiatric stays each year. Based on the latest available data, less than one in 10 subsidised patients exceeded the yearly withdrawal limit of $5,000, while less than three in 10 subsidised bills exceeded the daily withdrawal limit of $150 per day. For outpatient care, an average of 14,000 patients a year utilised Medisave for psychiatric conditions under the Chronic Disease Management Programme (CDMP) from 2016 to 2018. These conditions are selected in consultation with a Clinical Advisory Committee comprising clinical experts. The factors considered include level of disease burden, effectiveness of early intervention, and availability of clear clinical guidelines. The MediSave limit for CDMP was raised to $500 in 2018, and about two in 10 patients who withdrew MediSave for psychiatric conditions reached the yearly withdrawal limit.MediShield Life and MediSave limits are reviewed regularly to ensure that they cover the majority of subsidised patients’ bills. The on-going review of MediShield Life, including the claim limits, by the MediShield Life Council is expected to complete by end 2020. Those who cannot afford their treatment even after subsidies, MediShield Life and MediSave can approach the medical social workers for MediFund and other financial assistance. '},\n",

Similarly, smoking prevalence among Singapore residents aged 18-29 years has declined from 17.2% in 20072 to 9.9% in 2017.3 The average age of smokers who started smoking daily was 18 years in 2017.4 According to research conducted by the Health Promotion Board (HPB), the key reasons behind why the youth start smoking are social influence from friends and the perception that smoking is \"cool\".The Ministry of Health adopts a multi-pronged approach to curb smoking amongst Singaporeans young and old, which includes a comprehensive mix of strategies such as public education, provision of smoking cessation services, legislation controlling tobacco advertising, sales of cigarettes to minors and taxation.One key measure that addresses the role of social influence in smoking initiation is the Minimum Legal Age (MLA) for tobacco use. This was raised to 20 years on 1 January 2020, and will be raised to 21 years on 1 January 2021. This aims to denormalise tobacco use among youth below the age of 21, restrict their access to tobacco in their social circles, and hence reduce the likelihood of smoking initiation. To reduce the influence of positive communication around tobacco product brands, which may contribute to its perceived \"cool\" factor, the standardised packaging of tobacco products with enhanced graphic health warnings will come into force from 1 July 2020.  In the community and schools, HPB works with educators and community organisations to promote smoke-free living among our youth. HPB conducts smoking cessation training for educators and youth workers. In addition, Student Health Advisors are deployed in schools to support students on health issues, including tailored counselling to quit smoking.

It has made a good start in helping organisations improve their AI governance practices. It obtained industry views and advised the Government in developing and updating Singapore's Model AI Governance Framework (Model Framework), which translates ethical principles including human-centricity and safety into pragmatic measures that organisations can adopt voluntarily. This is important to engender public trust and acceptance of AI. A wide range of organisations is now using the Model Framework for their AI deployments.The Advisory Council also provided valuable input to the Implementation and Self-Assessment Guide for Organisations and Compendium of Use Cases, which help organisations apply the Model Framework.

First, in egregious cases where such conduct is accompanied by an underlying ill-intent or poses a law and order issue, offences under the Penal Code may be disclosed. If the dissemination is carried out with the intent to harass, Protection from Harassment Act (POHA) offences may be disclosed. Whether or not a criminal offence is disclosed depends on the facts and circumstances of each case. Second, under POHA, victims of harassing photographs or videos can also bring civil proceedings to require the publisher or social media platforms to take down the harassing material.We would like to remind everyone to behave compassionately and be mindful of the consequences when sharing photos and videos of victims of accidents and crimes.

The MLA will subsequently be raised to 21 years old on 1 January 2021.Under the Tobacco (Control of Advertisements and Sale) Act, anyone caught selling tobacco products to persons below the minimum legal age is liable, on conviction in Court, to a maximum fine of up to $5,000 for the first offence and up to $10,000 for the second or subsequent offence.

The breakdown of the reported loss in these three areas can be found in Table 1.Escrow arrangements have been implemented for some services like conveyancing services and major payment services. However, such arrangements may not be suitable for all businesses. Some use prepayments to facilitate the cashflow of their business operations to allow them to offer more competitive pricing to their customers. To help consumers identify businesses with good trading practices and shop with peace of mind, CASE has worked with industry associations to develop CaseTrust accreditation schemes for specific industries.

NEA has disallowed their usage for dine-in meals at all seven new hawker centres, and at five existing hawker centres which have adopted the use of common crockery and centralised dishwashing services under the Productive Hawker Centres programme. In addition, from September 2018, NEA does not allow new cooked food stallholders who commence their tenancies at existing hawker centres to provide disposables to patrons for dine-in meals. NEA works closely with the Hawkers\\' Associations and our appointed operators to ensure that these stallholders do not use disposables for dine-in meals. NEA does not collect statistics on the number of stalls that provide disposable utensils for dine-in customers.NEA is actively engaging the remaining stallholders to phase out the use of disposables for dine-in meals. Some concerns that stallholders commonly cite are the cost of reusable crockery and the cost of manpower required to wash crockery. On this front, we are working to introduce centralised dishwashing services at more hawker centres, and we have a grant scheme in place to defray some of the costs. We will continue to engage stallholders through the Hawkers\\' Associations to encourage them to switch to reusables.

The GFA is taken from \"as-built\" information submitted to the building authority when the schools were developed or upgraded, and is further verified by MOE\\'s Managing Agents prior to tender calling. Tenderers also visit a typical Primary school, Secondary school and Junior College to familiarise themselves with the nature and scope of services expected of them. Before a tender is called, schools will also provide input into the specifications so that their requirements are incorporated.The existing cleaning contract generally does not allow for price adjustments due to temporary changes or marginal discrepancies in GFA. Tenderers know that the numbers in the specifications serve as a guide, and it is in the interest of all parties not to have a tendering system that is too exact and detailed, as that will add administrative burden to everyone and can end up creating more disputes.

       "  'answer': 'Mrs Josephine Teo: The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) recognises that there could be instances where families with care-giving duties would require two foreign domestic workers (FDW) to help care for persons with disabilities. Hence, on a case-by-case basis, the Ministry approves the work permit applications of up to two FDWs for one care recipient. However, each care recipient is eligible for the concessionary levy of $60 per month for only one FDW. This is to be fair to all employers whose care-giving needs vary.The Government provides further support for households who may need help to defray care-giving costs. For example, the Ministry of Health provides a Home Caregiving Grant (HCG), which is a monthly cash payout of $200 to defray the cost of care-giving for individuals with permanent moderate disability. The HCG payout can be used flexibly for different care-giving expenses, including the cost of hiring an FDW. FDW employers who wish to train their FDWs in care-giving can also tap the Care-givers Training Grant which is an annual training subsidy of $200 for each care recipient.The Government will continue to review and improve the range of home-based support measures to meet the needs of persons with disabilities and their care-givers.

Among university graduates in the labour force, about 80% were in full-time permanent employment. Less than 10% were in part-time or temporary employment, mostly by choice. This trend has held stable over the past five years. However, Polytechnic and ITE graduates are much more likely to take up part-time or temporary work by choice, as they plan to go on to further studies.

       "  'answer': 'Mr Desmond Lee: There are more than 400 Student Care Centres (SCCs) registered with the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) to administer the Student Care Fee Assistance (SCFA) scheme under ComCare. These registered SCCs provide around 42,000 student care places, with some 32,000 children enrolled in them. While actual demand varies across areas, enrolment is below capacity in all towns. Besides these registered SCCs, there are also other centres providing student care services that are not registered as SCFA administrators.Of the appeals and feedback received from parents relating to SCC, about half (43%) concern particular SCC specific issues, such as hygiene and child management. About 5% of feedback relates to affordability and 6% relates to capacity. The remaining feedback covers a range of issues from the enrolment process to the requirements imposed on registered SCCs. MSF provides guidelines to registered SCCs on recommended educational qualifications and training for their supervisors and staff. For example, MSF recommends the Workforce Skills Qualifications Introductory Student Care Centre Course, conducted by Ngee Ann Polytechnic, for new SCC staff. This course trains SCC staff to provide a safe, challenging, positive and developmentally appropriate physical environment for SCC students.All registered SCCs are required to meet stipulated standards in the areas of supervision, physical environment, operating hours, safety, health and hygiene, and provide a structured daily programme. MSF conducts audits on registered SCCs, which may include surprise checks, at least once every two years to ensure compliance. More frequent checks may be conducted as needed, for example, to look into feedback and complaints received, and where the SCC has weaknesses identified in previous audits.'},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mr Desmond Lee: One of Government's key priorities is to ensure that parents have access to quality and affordable pre-schools for their children. This is to provide a good start for every child. To this end, the Early Childhood and Development Agency (ECDA) facilitates the development of child care centres (CCCs) in and near residential estates, community premises and at workplaces where there is demand.  Around two thirds (or 980) of all CCCs are located in HDB and private residential estates, with a total capacity of 107,000 places. One third (or 510) are located at or near workplaces – including commercial premises, Government buildings, and industrial estates – with a total capacity of 64,000. A small number are located in community premises, such as community centres. Of all these CCCs, 15% (or 210) are located in or near transportation hubs, that is, bus and MRT interchanges, with a total capacity of 26,000.  The large majority (or about 95%) of Anchor Operator (AOP) childcare centres are located in residential estates, as families have generally expressed a preference for childcare services close to their homes. The remaining 5% of AOP centres are located at or near workplaces. The Partner Operator (POP) scheme extends the range of affordable, quality options for families, with 60% of POP centres located in residential estates, and 40% located at or near workplaces. A small number of AOP and POP centres are also located in community premises. Of all these AOP and POP centres, 15% to 20% are located in or near transportation hubs.ECDA will continue to expand the provision of quality and affordable Government-supported pre-school places to cater to parents' needs and preferences.\"},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Gan Kim Yong: The five most common mental health conditions that were seen at public hospitals were schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder and substance abuse. At the polyclinics, depression, anxiety and insomnia were the three most common mental health conditions. Schizophrenia and depression were also common mental health conditions receiving service from the community intervention teams funded under MOH. For the whole public healthcare system, the average age of subsidised patients for the different mental health conditions seen was between 40 to 50 years old1. MOH does not track data on income nor time taken between onset of symptoms and treatment as the patient might have seen providers outside the public healthcare system. However, based on the Singapore Mental Health Study (2016)2, a self-reported survey, the median time taken between the onset of symptoms and seeking help is 11 years for Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD); four years for bipolar disorder and alcohol abuse, two years for Generalised Anxiety Disorder and one year for Major Depressive Disorder. Stigma and lack of mental health literacy may be contributory factors to the delay. There are various initiatives by the Government, as well as healthcare and community providers to proactively reach out to raise awareness of mental conditions and provide information on avenues to seek help, facilitate early identification and access to interventions. We have community outreach teams to educate the public on mental health conditions and dementia, and refer those with such conditions to the appropriate health and/ or social services. We have also increased access to mental health and or dementia services in 12 polyclinics.   Over the last three years (2016 to 2018), the average number of subsidised patients who received inpatient treatment for mental health conditions was about 6,900 per year, with an average length of stay (ALOS) of 21 days per admission. The average number of subsidised patients seen as outpatients for mental disorders was about 60,000 per year.MOH will continue to work with public hospitals and service providers in the community, including schools, social service agencies and family service centres, to provide holistic support for all persons with mental healthcare needs and to ensure timely access to quality care and support.

       "  'answer': \"Mr Gan Kim Yong: In 2018, the average overall median waiting time for new subsidised appointments across the public hospitals was 27 days1 to see a psychiatrist, and 28 days2 to see a psychologist. However, anyone requiring urgent mental health assistance or who wishes to see a psychiatrist, may contact the Institute of Mental Health's (IMH) 24-hour Mental Health Helpline3 or seek medical help at the 24-hour Emergency Services located at IMH. MOH does not have specific numbers of counsellors practising in Singapore as many healthcare professionals and social workers provide counselling as part of their work. For cases requiring community support, patients can be referred to Community Outreach Teams and Community Intervention Teams, and these cases are usually contacted within two weeks. There are around 2484 psychiatrists and 4735 psychologists practising in Singapore, which translates to 4.4 psychiatrists and 8.36 psychologists per 100,000 population. To reduce waiting time, the hospitals have implemented measures such as reviewing work processes to optimise appointment slots and efficiency of clinical operations (for example, calling patients prior to their appointment), tightening the triaging of urgency of cases, tiering services to the appropriate level of care, and right-siting of non-emergency or more stable cases to primary and community-based care to enable specialist services to focus on more complex cases. As of March 2019, we have set up 41 community outreach teams and, 21 allied health-led community intervention teams to provide mental health support in the community.

       "  'answer': 'Mr Gan Kim Yong: Cataract is one of the leading causes of blindness commonly associated with ageing. The risk of developing cataracts is higher if one regularly smokes or drinks alcohol, or has chronic diseases such as diabetes. MOH has efforts in place to promote general eye care amongst seniors. First, in prevention, the Health Promotion Board (HPB) conducts regular health talks in the community to equip seniors with bite-sized information to improve their physical, mental and functional health. Maintaining good eye health is one of the key topics, and seniors are taught the importance of good vision, early detection and management of common eye conditions, such as cataract and glaucoma, as well as simple eye care tips. Seniors can also obtain information on eye care and nutrition via the HealthHub website or app.Second, on early detection, we encourage our seniors to attend regular health screenings. In 2018, MOH partnered Temasek Foundation to roll out Project Silver Screen (PSS), a nationwide functional screening programme for seniors to check their vision, hearing and oral health. As part of the screening, seniors are advised on good eye care practices, and those with abnormal vision screening results are referred to an optometrist or eye specialist for further assessment. Since January 2018, more than 61,000 seniors have benefited from PSS, with about 20% referred for follow-up eye care services.  In addition, patients with diabetes, who are at higher risk of developing eye disorders, including cataract, are recommended to undergo regular eye screening as part of their routine care in polyclinics and Primary Care Network (PCN) General Practitioner clinics.Third, on accessibility, we have set up clinical eye care services in the community, particularly for seniors who may be less mobile. For example, MOH has worked with the public healthcare institutions (PHIs) to establish mobile eye services in the community, which provide in-depth visual testing to detect a wide range of eye conditions including cataract. The PHIs have also established six Community Eye Clinics (CECs) island-wide since June 2018, to provide prompt eye assessment and treatment for persons with stable eye conditions that do not require complex care by specialists. Specific to cataract management, optometrists and doctors at the CECs would also provide advice on monitoring symptoms, good eye health habits and appropriate follow-ups.  The above measures enable earlier detection and appropriate management of cataract and other vision disorders, so that our seniors can maintain their quality of life as far as possible. '},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Local training programmes are available for psychiatrists, psychologists and counsellors. Under MOH's Health Manpower Development Plan (HMDP), over the past three years, an average of three overseas experts from a variety of professions visited local healthcare institutions to advise and teach aspects of mental healthcare each year.  In addition, under the HMDP, an average of 13 local mental health professionals were sent to overseas centres to study and learn different models of care delivery each year. A Skills Framework (SF) was established in January 2019 to guide the developmental pathways of psychologists, including clinical psychologists. This framework for psychologists is administered by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF). MSF had also set up a Social Service SkillsFuture Tripartite Taskforce (STT) to drive, coordinate and implement tripartite collaborations for manpower development initiatives, including that for psychologists.Currently, there are about 2481 psychiatrists and 4732 psychologists in Singapore. This translates to 4.4 psychiatrists and 8.33 psychologists per 100,000 population.

       "  'answer': \"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Appeals for additional MediSave withdrawal beyond these limits are assessed on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration circumstances of the patient and his family, such as whether more complex treatment was required, as well as the family's social and financial situation. In some appeal cases, the patient may already have low MediSave balances, or expect recurrent treatment in future years, and additional Medisave withdrawal may not be the only or the best solution. To ensure that these patients have enough MediSave for their future needs, we may instead refer such cases to Medical Social Workers for other forms of support, such as MediFund. For cases that are likely to face more complicated and challenging social and financial issues, MOH may work with other agencies, such as MSF and HDB, to coordinate support for these patients.In other cases, the patient may have sought unsubsidised care resulting in unexpectedly large bills. In such cases, we would encourage the patient to also work out alternative payment arrangements, such as payment through an instalment plan, instead of prematurely depleting their MediSave balances which would be needed in future. As it takes time to obtain information and assess a patient's financial and clinical circumstances, it generally takes around one month to process an appeal after we have received it. We will continue to review MediSave withdrawal limits and our healthcare financing schemes to ensure that they remain adequate and relevant. No Singaporean will be denied access to necessary and appropriate healthcare because of an inability to pay.\"},\n",

MCI and IMDA have a range of initiatives to help Singaporeans from diverse backgrounds seize new employment opportunities in information technology, as well as manage career challenges caused by digital disruption. These include upskilling courses for ICT professionals, reskilling courses for working Singaporeans who wish to move from other sectors into ICT job roles, and programmes to encourage students to embark on an ICT career. These initiatives are designed to help match and prepare Singaporeans with the demands and requirements of the new ICT job roles, so that they can fully benefit from the emerging job opportunities.For working adults hoping to pursue an ICT career, the TechSkills Accelerator (TeSA) programme provides training for ICT job roles that are in demand by the industry. To date, more than 93,000 training places have been taken up or committed since TeSA started in 2016. In total, more than 4,300 companies have upskilled their existing ICT workforce and a further 900 have employed individuals trained through TeSA. TeSA\\'s Company-Led Training Programme works with private-sector companies to provide on-the-job training to fresh graduates and experienced professionals. Trainees build up their tech skills by working on industry projects and through interactions with tech practitioners and business users. As of October 2019, 50 companies have participated in the programme since its inception, and all trainees have secured full-time jobs upon completion of their training.For ICT professionals who wish to upskill themselves in emerging areas with strong industry demand, such as Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Cybersecurity and Internet of Things, the Critical Infocomm Technology Resource Programme Plus (CITREP+) helps them gain specialised ICT skills through short-form training and certifications.In addition, MCI and IMDA are stepping up efforts to ensure that mid-career PMETs and those hoping to take on an ICT job role are able to adapt to challenges brought about by technological changes in industry. The Tech Immersion and Placement Programme (TIPP) provides an immersive training course delivered by industry practitioners. As of October 2019, about 1,400 trainees have completed TIPP with a more than 90% job placement in companies ranging from start-ups to large enterprises. Mid-career professionals are also encouraged to leverage TeSA\\'s integrated career services, a career support ecosystem, to get career guidance, mentoring, and support for better job matching. Our trade associations are also actively contributing their efforts to help locals. Under the Career Compass initiative, the Singapore Computer Society has provided experienced ICT mentors to partner with career centres managed by Workforce Singapore. SGTech has also been helping to manage some Professional Conversion Programmes with platform companies, such as Salesforce, to help train and place locals into jobs. MCI and IMDA will continue to provide Singaporeans with the means to reskill, upskill, and seize better job opportunities in the digital economy.In an increasingly technologically driven world, we must support future generations of Singaporeans to lead and thrive in the digital age. To interest school-going Singaporeans to develop ICT skills, IMDA has programmes such as the \"Code for Fun\" enrichment programme to inspire students and develop their computational thinking. IMDA\\'s tertiary talent development programme provides scholarships and global exposure opportunities for tertiary students through immersion programmes and international competitions. For example, the Industry Preparation for Pre-graduates (iPREP) equips ITE, Polytechnic and University students with relevant skillsets for an ICT career through work attachments and overseas internships.

       "  'answer': 'Mr S Iswaran: Digitalisation creates exciting opportunities for both Singaporeans and enterprises who seek to benefit from the growth of the digital economy. MCI and IMDA have a range of initiatives to help Singaporeans from diverse backgrounds seize new employment opportunities in information technology, as well as manage career challenges caused by digital disruption. These include upskilling courses for ICT professionals, reskilling courses for working Singaporeans who wish to move from other sectors into ICT job roles, and programmes to encourage students to embark on an ICT career. These initiatives are designed to help match and prepare Singaporeans with the demands and requirements of the new ICT job roles, so that they can fully benefit from the emerging job opportunities.For working adults hoping to pursue an ICT career, the TechSkills Accelerator (TeSA) programme provides training for ICT job roles that are in demand by the industry. To date, more than 93,000 training places have been taken up or committed since TeSA started in 2016. In total, more than 4,300 companies have upskilled their existing ICT workforce and a further 900 have employed individuals trained through TeSA. TeSA\\'s Company-Led Training Programme works with private-sector companies to provide on-the-job training to fresh graduates and experienced professionals. Trainees build up their tech skills by working on industry projects and through interactions with tech practitioners and business users. As of October 2019, 50 companies have participated in the programme since its inception, and all trainees have secured full-time jobs upon completion of their training.For ICT professionals who wish to upskill themselves in emerging areas with strong industry demand, such as Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Cybersecurity and Internet of Things, the Critical Infocomm Technology Resource Programme Plus (CITREP+) helps them gain specialised ICT skills through short-form training and certifications.In addition, MCI and IMDA are stepping up efforts to ensure that mid-career PMETs and those hoping to take on an ICT job role are able to adapt to challenges brought about by technological changes in industry. The Tech Immersion and Placement Programme (TIPP) provides an immersive training course delivered by industry practitioners. As of October 2019, about 1,400 trainees have completed TIPP with a more than 90% job placement in companies ranging from start-ups to large enterprises. Mid-career professionals are also encouraged to leverage TeSA\\'s integrated career services, a career support ecosystem, to get career guidance, mentoring, and support for better job matching. Our trade associations are also actively contributing their efforts to help locals. Under the Career Compass initiative, the Singapore Computer Society has provided experienced ICT mentors to partner with career centres managed by Workforce Singapore. SGTech has also been helping to manage some Professional Conversion Programmes with platform companies, such as Salesforce, to help train and place locals into jobs. MCI and IMDA will continue to provide Singaporeans with the means to reskill, upskill, and seize better job opportunities in the digital economy.In an increasingly technologically driven world, we must support future generations of Singaporeans to lead and thrive in the digital age. To interest school-going Singaporeans to develop ICT skills, IMDA has programmes such as the \"Code for Fun\" enrichment programme to inspire students and develop their computational thinking. IMDA\\'s tertiary talent development programme provides scholarships and global exposure opportunities for tertiary students through immersion programmes and international competitions. For example, the Industry Preparation for Pre-graduates (iPREP) equips ITE, Polytechnic and University students with relevant skillsets for an ICT career through work attachments and overseas internships. Tertiary institutions have also expanded the number of places offered in ICT-related programmes to encourage more students to specialise in information technology.MCI will continue to work with our partners to enable Singaporeans to take on good ICT jobs and fully benefit from Singapore\\'s growing digital economy.'},\n",

The \"greening\" of buildings play an important part in ensuring Singapore continues to develop sustainably and meet our international climate change commitments. Singapore is targeting to \"green\" 80% of our total building gross floor area (GFA) by 2030 and to date, about half of Singapore\\'s non-residential building GFA has been greened to meet minimum sustainability standards. Today, users of air-conditioning in commercial buildings are encouraged to set their indoor temperatures at around 25 degrees Celsius through voluntary schemes like the BCA Green Mark (GM) scheme. The GM scheme recognises buildings for maintaining indoor temperature in air-conditioned space at 24 to 26 degrees Celsius. Under the scheme, recognition is also given for the installation of energy efficient air-conditioning systems. The latest Third Green Building Masterplan, launched in 2014, also focuses on changing the way building tenants and occupants consume energy. Aside from commercial buildings, the Government also works closely with industries on cooling efficiency.

       "  'answer': 'Mr Lawrence Wong: The Executive Condominium (EC) Housing Scheme was introduced to provide an affordable option for higher-income Singaporeans who aspire to own private housing. That is why ECs offer similar design features and facilities as private condominiums, and are treated as strata-titled private housing after 10 years. Given this objective, it would not be possible for HDB to take over the development of ECs.  The Government has put in place various measures to ensure that ECs remain affordable. For example, initial eligibility and ownership restrictions, such as an income ceiling and a minimum occupation period, are imposed on EC buyers. This helps to reduce the land cost of the EC projects, as well as their selling price. Currently, the prices of ECs are about 25% cheaper than private condominiums of similar size and location. EC buyers also benefit from the CPF Housing Grant when making their purchase.

       "  'answer': 'Mr Ong Ye Kung: Our approach is not to teach technology or information technology through a single subject but through a multi-faceted, immersive experience. At the Primary and Secondary levels, students have many opportunities to develop their interest in information technology including through enrichment programmes, such as Code for Fun and Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs). Secondary students can participate in technology-related Applied Learning Programmes (ALP) and formal Computing subjects. Moving ahead, these opportunities will be expanded further. For example, starting in 2020, all primary students will now participate in the Code For Fun enrichment programme. Also, starting in 2023, some primary schools will offer ALPs in technology-related areas, such as health science, robotics and coding. We also need to recognise that the foundation of technology-related competencies lie in Mathematics and Science, which are also traditional strengths of our education system.  We must therefore continue to focus on these subjects in school, and encourage students with the interest to take up STEM subjects or courses. For example, those with a special talent or interest in computing can offer O-Level and A-Level Computing in selected schools, and develop key skills to pursue their interest further at the post-secondary level.The Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) offer many STEM-related pathways in engineering, information technology, data analytics and artificial intelligence. They regularly refresh the curriculum to ensure that they are up to date with the latest developments in technology and industry demands.  The IHLs also ensure students possess baseline competencies needed in the digital economy. For example, all Polytechnic and Institute of Technical Education (ITE) students have to complete a module on data analysis for problem solving, and students at National University of Singapore (NUS), Nanyang Technological University (NTU), and Singapore Management University (SMU) all undergo modules on computational thinking. Even after leaving school, Singaporeans can continue to stay abreast with technology through various SkillsFuture courses. These subsidised courses are offered across different proficiency levels, and help Singaporeans stay relevant in the digital workplace. Singaporeans who wish to move into ICT jobs can also take advantage of TechSkills Accelerator programmes to acquire relevant and in-demand digital skills.'},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mr Ong Ye Kung: MOE has been monitoring the number of students in private education institutions (PEIs) offering external degree programmes closely. This is because unlike Autonomous Universities and publicly-funded degree courses, we do not have direct oversight of the institutions and their programmes. However, we do regulate them to ensure that systems and processes are in place to protect students' interest.Over the years, we have tightened the regulations on these PEIs. One of the new requirements introduced two years ago was to conduct graduate employment surveys and make results public so students can make more informed choices. The latest survey results showed that the median starting salary for graduates of private Universities is $2,650, compared to $3,500 for Autonomous Universities, and $2,501 for Polytechnic graduates who have completed their National Service.Over the past five years, the number of Singaporeans who were admitted into PEIs undergoing full-time degree programmes have decreased from 8,200 to 6,100.This is partly because of the tighter regulations and transparency in graduate outcomes.

       "  'answer': 'Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Climate change brings new existential threats. Singapore is already experiencing warmer temperatures, more intense rainfall and prolonged dry spells. Being an island state, we are also vulnerable to sea level rise. Just like how we have tackled other existential challenges in the past, we will plan ahead and invest in innovative solutions to reduce emissions as well as protect Singapore against the impacts of climate change.We are making hefty investments in research and development (R&D) to develop solutions to decarbonise our grid, industries, and even our buildings. Nine hundred million dollars has been set aside for the Urban Solutions and Sustainability domain under our national Research, Innovation and Enterprise plan. We are working closely with industry and academic partners to develop as well as deploy innovative technologies and resource-efficient solutions that not only address our local challenges, but can also be applicable to other urban centres. For example, we are driving the adoption of super-low energy and zero-energy buildings and working closely with industry to implement more carbon-efficient processes.Singapore is alternative energy-disadvantaged. Nevertheless, we are working to maximise the deployment of solar energy, our most feasible source of renewal energy. To overcome our land constraints, PUB has conducted floating solar photovoltaic (PV) cell test-bed in Tengeh Reservoir to study the performance and cost-effectiveness of 10 different PV systems. Following the study, PUB has sought proposals from companies to build a large-scale floating solar PV system in Tengeh Reservoir (of at least 50 megawatt-peak), and deploy two smaller systems in Bedok and Lower Seletar Reservoirs. We are also studying and developing technologies in other areas, including studying the potential of \"clean fuels\", such as hydrogen, and carbon capture, utilisation and storage.   Mitigation and adaptation must go hand-in-hand as we are mindful that we are unable to reverse climate change completely. We have placed equally strong emphasis on the sciences in our adaptation plans because Singapore’s climate change policies must be based on robust climate science. We established the Centre for Climate Research Singapore (CCRS) in 2013 and today, CCRS is one of the few dedicated centres in the region that focuses on research in tropical weather and climate. CCRS will set up a new Programme Office next year to drive the formulation and implementation of our national climate science research masterplan and systematically build up climate science capabilities across our research institutes and universities.To deepen our knowledge in a complex and multi-disciplinary issue like sea level rise, CCRS recently launched a call for research proposals for the National Sea Level Programme (NSLP) grant. The NSLP brings together both local and international experts to integrate and analyse various domain areas in sea level rise, and customise it to our local context. To protect our coasts, low-lying areas and communities from sea level rise, we are exploring various coastal protection technologies and solutions, including learning from the experience of other countries. For example, we are building a small polder at Pulau Tekong to gain experience in operating one. Our agencies will also undertake R&D to enhance the cost-effectiveness of coastal protection solutions. Even as we pursue innovative solutions, we will need to harness the collective efforts of the Government, businesses, civil society and Singaporeans to fight climate change.'},\n",

       "  'answer': \"7 Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) what are the respective roles of grassroots advisors (GAs) and elected Members of Parliament (MPs) in deciding (i) leadership and (ii) membership of grassroots leaders appointed by People's Association (PA); (b) how are GAs and MPs respectively empowered to influence the operations and decisions of (i) Citizens' Consultative Committees (CCCs) and (ii) Community Development and Welfare Fund (CDWFs); and (c) whether the Citizens' Consultative Committee ComCare Fund (CCF) applications and CDWF disbursements are decided by GAs or MPs.Mr Chan Chun Sing (for the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth): Members of Parliament (MPs) are elected to represent their constituents in Parliament, to debate and make laws. They conduct Meet-the-People sessions and lead their town councils in managing the municipal operations and issues of the estates.The role of Grassroots Advisors (GRAs) is different from that of MPs. GRAs are appointed by the People’s Association (PA), a statutory board under the MCCY. The PA's role is to promote social cohesion, and to act as a bridge between the Government and the people. The PA appoints GRAs to guide its grassroots organisations (GROs) in communicating and implementing the policies and programmes of the Government of the day. These include difficult and unpopular policies which are necessary for the good of Singapore, such as CPF cuts during the 1986 recession, the increase in retirement age and the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA). In appointing GRAs, the PA therefore looks to those whom can be entrusted to carry out this role faithfully.Similarly, the PA appoints grassroots leaders, including volunteers who serve on the Citizens' Consultative Committees (CCC). Among other things, the CCCs help the PA to administer Government and local schemes such as the Community Development and Welfare Fund (CDWF) and CCC ComCare Fund (CCF), based on established criteria.  The CDWF supports community bonding programmes and welfare assistance for needy residents. The CDWF Committee, appointed by the CCC, manages and oversees the disbursement of funds. Those applying for welfare assistance under CDWF should minimally fulfil the following criteria:(a) Residents of the constituency or Division of Group Representation Constituency (GRC) where the CCC serves; and(b) Singapore Citizens or Permanent Residents (PRs) or their children must be Singapore Citizen or PR.Established under the ComCare Endowment Fund (ComCare), the CCF offers interim assistance to needy residents who require urgent and temporary financial relief. The CCC helps to administer the scheme based on the eligibility criteria set by MSF. For the amount and duration of assistance rendered by CCF, the CCCs can grant up to three months of financial assistance per application, capped at $200 per month. Residents with longer term financial needs will be referred to the MSF's Social Service Offices. Residents can apply for both the CDWF and CCF at the Community Centres/Clubs. In instances where applications for the CCF or CDWF do not meet the eligibility criteria, the CCC and CDWF committee may seek the help of the GRA to identify and connect residents with other sources of government and community support.Based on an average of Financial Year (FY) 2016 to FY2018, the amount of direct grant given by PA to the CCCs and CDWFs is about $290,000 per CCC and $9,000 per CDWF per FY. These grants are used towards welfare assistance and community bonding programmes.\"},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Ong Ye Kung: MOE has studied a number of international models for supporting students with Special Educational Needs (SEN). The models differ, reflecting the specific context of each jurisdiction. British Columbia, for example, places great emphasis on the mainstreaming of students with SEN. However, other education authorities such as that in the UK recognise that the educational needs of children with higher needs are better met in more specialised settings, and are setting up more specialised schools and units for children with SEN.In Singapore, we have adopted a multi-pronged approach, so as to cater to the diverse range of educational needs of students with SEN. Hence, around 80% of students with SEN, including many with dyslexia, Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), as well as the majority of students with sensory and physical impairment, are in mainstream schools. The rest who have moderate-to-severe SEN, are in Special Education (SPED) schools. That way, students with moderate-to-severe SEN can benefit from a highly customised curriculum and pedagogy, delivered by specially-trained SPED teachers, and supported by a range of allied professionals such as psychologists and therapists. Having well-trained staff is key to the quality of support for students with SEN. In mainstream schools, all Allied Educators (Learning and Behavioural Support) [AED(LBS)] undergo the Diploma in Special Education (DISE) programme at the National Institute of Education (NIE). In 2016, MOE enhanced the career structure, progression and development of AED(LBS), including creating higher appointments, such as Lead AED(LBS), Master AED(LBS) and Chief AED(LBS) to lead the fraternity at the school cluster, zonal and national levels. MOE enhanced professional development opportunities for AED(LBS) through modular training, conferences and milestone programmes, and offer scholarships and awards to AED(LBS) for further studies. The number of SPED teachers has increased by about 40% since 2014, to meet the needs of the growing enrolment of students with SEN. MOE and NCSS will continue to support mainstream and SPED schools in the recruitment of educators with appropriate skill-sets and aptitude to teach students with moderate-to-severe SEN. '},\n",

They comprised less than 0.03% of all workplace injuries and occupational diseases in the same period.  MOM together with the Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Council, has developed the WSH Guidelines on Managing Heat Stress in the Workplace. The guidelines inform employers to conduct risk assessments associated with heat stress and the precautionary actions they should take to prevent heat stress at work. These include acclimatising newly arrived workers who come from colder climates, providing regular rest breaks at shaded areas, making cool drinking water accessible, and educating workers on the symptoms and seriousness of heat-related disorders.The WSH Council has also been disseminating information on heat-related safety and health risks through its website, the WSH bulletin1, as well as collaterals such as the Heat Stroke Card. Heat stress is also included in the WSH Council's Total WSH Programme. Total WSH consultants are expected to advise companies on what they can do to protect workers from heat stress.Heat stroke and dehydration are already included in the types of work incidents that are reportable.

       "  'answer': \"Mrs Josephine Teo: To cater to the needs of working parents, including mothers re-entering the workforce, childcare centres are required to operate from 7 am to 7 pm on weekdays, and from 7 am to 2 pm on Saturdays. This arrangement meets the needs of most parents, without extending the working hours of childcare centre workers. For families working shifts or on weekends, many of them arrange for other care-givers, such as grandparents and relatives, to help out. Some centres may extend their services, taking into consideration demand and resources. Currently, around 55 centres operate beyond 7 pm on weekdays.Mothers, including those re-entering the workforce, may prefer some flexibility in their work hours to meet their care-giving needs. Through the Work-Life Grant and Tripartite Standard (TS) on Flexible Work Arrangements (FWAs), the Government encourages employers to provide FWAs such as flexible start and end times or telecommuting to help employees better manage work and family responsibilities. As at end-September, around 1,900 employers, covering around 450,000 employees, have adopted the Tripartite Standard on FWAs.

Such CYPs generally continue to attend school and participate in activities in the community. Where there are mental health concerns, these CYPs are supported by school counsellors and/or MSF psychologists, together with the care team of the Homes. There are also multidisciplinary Response, Early Intervention, Assessment in Community Mental Health teams to strengthen the ability of schools and SSAs to identify and support CYPs with mental health concerns and to make appropriate referrals. Where the mental health concerns are more severe, the CYPs may be referred to medical institutions such as the Child Guidance Clinic run by the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), where they may receive outpatient treatment, such as psychotherapy, or be admitted for inpatient treatment. Before the CYPs are discharged, caseworkers in the Homes engage the relevant medical professionals to formulate post-discharge care plans such as follow-up treatment and safety planning.

       "  'answer': \"Mr K Shanmugam: The Government adopts a multi-pronged approach against online vice. The Police and the Infocomm Media Development Authority regularly block vice websites targeting Singaporeans, as and when they are discovered. To date, 202 such websites have been blocked. The Police also conduct regular enforcement operations to disrupt and deter vice activities, including those perpetuated through online platforms. For example, in November 2018, Police conducted a joint operation with China's Ministry of Public Security against a transnational online vice syndicate. This led to the arrest of 201 persons in Singapore and China and the shutting down of a website which advertised sexual services in Singapore. MHA takes a tough stance against vice, and in fact is proposing amendments to the Women's Charter this month to further strengthen our levers against online vice syndicates. The Police conduct extensive public communication efforts on vice activities and related arrests. Members of the public are encouraged to report any criminal or suspicious activities they see, such as the operation of online platforms that promote vice activities. They can call 1800-255-0000, submit the information via Police's i-Witness, or lodge a report in person at a Police station. More broadly, the Government has introduced a number of programmes to raise awareness of online harms and promote safe and responsible use of the Internet. For example, MOE's Cyber Wellness Education Programme educates students on appropriate online behavior. These lessons sensitise students to potential negative influences they may encounter online, and teach students how to protect themselves. MCI has also been putting in efforts to strengthen digital literacy among Singaporeans. It launched the Digital Media and Information Literacy Framework in July 2019 to develop in Singaporeans a fundamental appreciation of the risks and benefits of technology, and cultivate a basic understanding of how to use technology safely and responsibly.  The community and parents also play a critical role. We are glad to see organisations, such as the Media Literacy Council (MLC), engaging in outreach efforts on safer Internet use.

       "  'answer': \"Mr Desmond Lee: Under the Early Childhood Development Centres Act, kindergartens are licensed to provide half-day education programmes of six hours or less per session. As the provision requirements for kindergartens are for half-day education services only, kindergartens cannot provide care services for pre-school-aged children. Nevertheless, centres that wish to provide such before or after preschool care services can do so if they are licensed as childcare centres instead.Subject to the Early Childhood Development Agency’s (ECDA) approval, pre-schools may provide before and after school care (BASC) services during their operating hours for older children aged seven to below 14 years. This is mainly to cater to working parents who require after-school care support for their Primary-school going children, including those who may have siblings attending the pre-school where the BASC services are provided. The BASC programme must be run in a separate space from the preschool programme, and centres can enrol children only up to 10% of the centre’s accommodation capacity. The centre must adhere to stipulated safety, health, hygiene and supervision standards, to ensure the well-being of the children. To date, ECDA has not received any applications from kindergartens to run BASC services during their operating hours.Kindergarten operators may also offer BASC services for older children after the kindergarten's operating hours or outside the kindergarten premises. There are currently three private kindergarten operators which provide such services and are registered with MSF to also administer the Student Care Fee Assistance Scheme.

An important first step towards this is improving the chances of employers being matched with FDWs who can suitably meet their household needs.With this aim in mind, MOM recently announced that from October 2020, employers and employment agencies (EAs) will be provided with more information on the past work experience of prospective FDWs to help improve matching outcomes. This would include the FDW's previous job scope, the residence type and household size of the FDW's former employer, as well as the FDW's reason for leaving her past employments.Besides these efforts, MOM regularly reaches out to employers and FDWs through electronic direct mailers and newsletters that often feature best practices and tips on how to develop good working relationships through mutual understanding and support. For first-time employers and FDWs, entering into a new work arrangement entails substantial adjustment. This is why MOM requires all first-time employers of FDWs to attend the Employers' Orientation Programme (EOP), which helps them understand their roles and responsibilities as employers. The EOP emphasises the importance of developing a good employer-FDW relationship and reminds employers to be understanding and patient when guiding FDWs on their household chores and integrating them with the family. Similarly, first-time FDWs have to attend the Settling-In-Programme (SIP), which introduces them to the social norms in Singapore and teaches them how to maintain open communication with their employers.   There are also many on-going efforts by employment agencies (EAs) and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to promote a positive working relationship between employers and FDWs. The Association of Employment Agencies Singapore (AEA(S)) gives out awards to honour and recognise FDWs and employers who have maintained healthy long-lasting relationships. NGOs like the Centre for Domestic Employees (CDE) and the Foreign Domestic Worker Association for Social Support and Training (FAST) also organise fun and social activities to encourage bonding between FDWs and their employers. CDE and FAST now also offer dispute resolution services to help employers and FDWs work out their disagreements. Many of our employers do make the effort to ensure that their FDWs are adjusting well. An FDW survey conducted in 2015 showed that the vast majority (97%) of FDWs were satisfied with working in Singapore. MOM will continue to work with EAs and NGOs to promote a healthy working relationship between employers and FDWs. \"},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Desmond Lee: The Government is committed to enhancing access to affordable and quality pre-schools. To achieve this, the Government funds operators through the Anchor Operator and Partner Operator schemes, and runs MOE Kindergartens. The Anchor Operator scheme was introduced in 2009. Government grants are provided to Anchor Operators in return for them adhering to fee caps1 for the pre-school places they provide, plus significant demands on efforts to improve quality and invest in teacher development. In addition, Anchor Operators offer Malay and Tamil language instruction, and support enrolment of children from low-income families. There are currently five Anchor Operators. As at end 2018, the Anchor Operators operated about 570 centres and enrolled 60,300 Singapore Citizen children.As the size of Anchor Operators varies substantially, it is more meaningful to look at the amount of Government grants provided for each child. For 2018, the Government provided about $6,000 of grants (on average) for each Singapore Citizen child enrolled in Anchor Operator centres. The highest grant per child was provided for children in MY World Preschool, E-Bridge Preschool, and Skool4Kidz.'},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mrs Josephine Teo: In 2016, MOM introduced the Advance Placement Scheme (APS) to reduce the time taken for households with urgent caregiving needs, such as eldercare and/or childcare, to hire foreign domestic workers (FDWs). There are currently 32 employment agencies (EAs) on the APS. The EAs on the APS are carefully selected based on their track record and training plans for their FDWs. In addition, MOM also monitors carefully the number of FDWs placed successfully by the EAs through the APS. On average, about 3,000 prospective FDWs were brought in under the APS each year. The vast majority (90%) of them were successfully matched with employers. For the remaining 10%, the EAs will make arrangements to send them home. There is another scheme, the Eldercarer FDW Scheme administered by the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC), which specifically helps households that require FDWs trained in eldercare. There are currently 55 EAs under the Scheme. Households that require faster deployment of their FDWs can also select EAs participating in the APS. There are 15 EAs that are on both the APS and the Eldercarer FDW Scheme. Since the introduction of the APS, MOM has progressively expanded the number of participating APS EAs to meet the demand from households.

       "  'answer': 'Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): Singapore recognises that climate change is a global and national existential issue and there is urgency for all countries to take climate action. Singapore’s Emissions Intensity (EI), that is, greenhouse gas emissions per dollar of GDP, is currently one of the lowest in the world. This is the result of choosing environmentally responsible policies as we developed, for example our vehicle control and use measures; and converting almost completely to the use of natural gas for electricity generation instead of fuel oil since the early 2000s. In comparison, many developed and developing countries are still using significant amounts of coal for electricity generation, and motor-vehicle fuel is still subsidised in several countries in our region. We are continuing to do our part to address greenhouse gas emissions. We have pledged in our Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) that by 2030, we will further reduce our EI by 36% from 2005 levels. We also aim to peak our emissions at 65 million tonne of CO2 equivalent around 2030. This commitment was made after carefully assessing our circumstances, and what we are able to do. Singapore\\'s NDC is ambitious, given our circumstances. We are a small, highly urbanised city-state, and our small land area, lack of great rivers and low and variable wind speeds limit our ability to deploy nuclear and renewable energy sources such as hydro, wind and solar energy. Nonetheless, we seek to push the bounds of innovation such as deploying floating solar photovoltaic systems on our reservoirs and offshore to make up for shortage of land area to deploy them. Such innovations have given us confidence to raise our level of ambition, to double our solar deployment target from 1 Gigawatt peak (GWp) beyond 2020 to at least 2 GWp by 2030. At this level, solar power will be able to meet around 4% of our current annual electricity needs.  Achieving our NDC will require significant whole-of-nation effort. We constantly encourage businesses and individuals to be more energy efficient. We amended the Energy Conservation Act in 2017 to require large industrial emitters to implement good energy management practices. Our policies aim to help our industries, such as petro-chemicals and electronics, be among the best-in-class globally so that we can be a responsible supplier of such products. This year, we implemented an enhanced set of Industry Energy Efficiency schemes. The Government is also making major investments to enhance public transport and active mobility infrastructure so that, by 2040, nine in 10 of all peak period journeys will be made on \"walk, cycle and ride\" transport modes, where \"ride\" refers to public and shared transport. We were the first to implement an economy-wide carbon tax in our region and did so without exemptions.  We are studying how further advances in technology can help Singapore transit earlier to a lower carbon future, and exploring the feasibility of working towards net zero emissions. For example, the Government has commissioned studies to evaluate the opportunities and challenges of carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS), and \"green\" hydrogen, and recommend next steps for Singapore. We will also work with industry and our research community to explore pilot projects and implement research and development initiatives to improve their feasibility, and to develop the necessary frameworks to support adoption when these solutions become economically viable.Climate change is a global issue that requires a global response, and we are committed to work with the international community to address this urgent challenge. For Singapore to do our full part, the Government cannot do it alone. We are heartened that Singaporeans, especially our youth, care deeply about this issue. A recent survey by the National Climate Change Secretariat also showed that most Singaporeans understand the importance of the issue and are prepared to take climate-friendly actions in their daily lives to address the issue. Saving electricity, using public transport and reducing waste are practical ways for Singaporeans to cut carbon emissions. We will continue to work closely with businesses, the community and individuals to do more to tackle climate change together.'},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr K Shanmugam: The increase was mainly due to lapses by Resorts World Sentosa (RWS) in performing required customer due diligence (CDD) checks; this accounted for $650,000 of the total increase from the year before. There was also an increase of $35,000 in financial penalties imposed for social safeguard breaches by both Marina Bay Sands (MBS) and RWS.On the lapses relating to CDD, RWS had processed some transactions when the required checks on the patrons were incomplete, and had failed to verify the identities of certain patrons. The casinos handle a lot of cash, and are thus susceptible to risks of money laundering and terrorism financing. CDD requirements are important measures to mitigate this risk. On the lapses relating to social safeguards, RWS had allowed five minors and MBS had allowed one, to enter the casinos. MBS had also allowed a Permanent Resident to enter without payment of entry levy.

       "  'question': \"Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources in light of the water level at Johor's Linggiu Reservoir falling below 50% due to the on-going dry weather, what plans does the Ministry have to work with Malaysia to increase the yield of the Johor River, which has its water flow regulated by the Linggiu Reservoir, to ensure a sustainable water supply for both countries.\",\n",
       "  'answer': \"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The water level at Linggiu Reservoir has fallen from 72% at the start of 2019 to below 50% in September 2019. While the water level has since risen slightly to above 50% in October 2019, Linggiu Reservoir has been slow to recover because more water is being drawn from the Johor River than is sustainable. This is exacerbated during dry weather, as PUB needs to discharge more water from Linggiu Reservoir to support water abstractions from the Johor River by both Malaysia and Singapore. Malaysia has built water plants upstream of the Johor River Waterworks (JRWW), which have increased the abstraction of water from the Johor River beyond what is sustainable. Singapore built the Linggiu Reservoir at a cost of more than $300 million to enable reliable abstraction of water at PUB's JRWW. If the Linggiu Reservoir fails, the Johor River flows during dry periods will not be sufficient to meet the abstractions of Johor's water treatment plants and Singapore’s JRWW. Singapore's right to abstract our full entitlement of 250 million gallons of water per day under the 1962 Water Agreement will then be compromised.As mentioned by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the 9th Singapore-Malaysia Leaders' Retreat in April 2019, Singapore and Malaysia have an interest to work together to ensure a sustainable water supply for both sides. MEWR and PUB have been engaging our Malaysian counterparts at both the federal and state levels through regular meetings and exchanges. Both sides have noted Singapore and Malaysia’s mutual interest in identifying appropriate and timely measures, including additional schemes, to increase the yield of the Johor River. Singapore and Malaysia have long-standing cooperation on water issues and Singapore will continue to work with Malaysia to achieve mutually-beneficial outcomes and ensure a sustainable water supply for both countries. \"},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Packaging waste is a priority waste stream identified in Singapore's Zero Waste Masterplan. We are putting in place a regulatory framework to reduce, reuse and recycle packaging under the Resource Sustainability Act. Next year, we will implement mandatory reporting of packaging data and plans to reduce, reuse or recycle packaging. This includes packaging used in the delivery of online purchases. This reporting will focus companies' attention on the packaging that they are placing on the market and increase their awareness of the potential for reducing packaging use in their operations. The requirements will apply to manufacturers and importers of packaged goods, as well as supermarkets with an annual turnover of more than $10 million. This includes Singapore-registered e-commerce companies that are also manufacturers and importers of packaged goods, as well as online supermarkets. However, it is difficult to impose our regulations on overseas e-commerce companies. This is a challenge faced around the world. We will closely monitor developments in this area and consult the local industry on ways to bring these companies on board.   The reporting framework will lay the foundation for an Extended Producer Responsibility framework to manage packaging waste including plastics, which will be put in place no later than 2025 or even earlier. We will also complement the regulatory framework with measures such as educational campaigns and co-creation of solutions. We will convene a Citizens' Workgroup next year to discuss and identify the way forward for us to collectively address excessive consumption of single-use plastics in Singapore.

       "  'answer': \"Mr Gan Kim Yong: While the Ministry does not specifically track over-prescription of medication, there are measures in place to minimise excessive provision of medication.  Depending on a patient's condition, doctors generally prescribe a supply of medication till the patient’s next appointment date. The supply of medication is normally set at no more than three months for normal medication and no more than six months for more stable chronic illnesses. For newly prescribed medications, public healthcare institutions encourage patients to collect a shorter duration of medication to prevent wastage, as the medication may be unsuitable. Public healthcare hospitals also carry out medication reconciliation prior to a patient's discharge. This is a process of creating a consolidated list of all medications a patient is taking and reconciling them where appropriate. It helps to reduce potential adverse effects arising from medication interactions and reduce unnecessary drugs. Dispensing pharmacists also review the patient's medication to eliminate unnecessary or excessive supply of medication.Beyond the public healthcare institutions, the Pharmaceutical Society of Singapore also holds regular public education events to encourage patients not to over collect medications. \"},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Lawrence Wong: Development Charge (DC) is a tax payable on any enhancement in land value arising from URA granting planning permission for a development application. The DC system allows the state to channel the gains from the enhancement in land value to offset the costs of developing public infrastructure, for example, roads and utilities.  DC rates are broken down in nine broad use groups and 118 geographical sectors. Hotels and backpackers\\' hostels are under the same broad use group, as they both provide short-term accommodation and are allowed on sites zoned \"Hotel\" under the Master Plan.

       "  'answer': \"Mr Desmond Lee: Whilst MSF does not track the number of Singapore residents specifically experiencing food insecurity, we support low-income households in a number of ways, including with their food-related needs. When people apply to the Social Service Offices (SSOs) for assistance under ComCare, their needs are assessed holistically – finances, food, healthcare, employment, family-relationship issues, and housing. When ComCare financial assistance is provided, it includes provision for food. Based on the assessed needs, SSOs may also link families with other Government agencies and social service agencies for other forms of support. One example is MOH's Meals-on-Wheels programme, which provides cooked meal deliveries to eligible clients who are unable to buy and prepare their own meals.The community plays a strong role in complementing the Government's efforts on food issues. MSF is aware of more than 20 registered charities and a growing number of informal groups in Singapore providing a variety of food support, including cooked meals, dry rations, and perishables, such as bread and vegetables. Apart from such charities, grassroots organisations and religious organisations such as mosques, churches and temples also provide free food to those in need. These organisations and informal groups are largely volunteer-driven and collaborate closely with community agencies such as Family Service Centres in their food collection and distribution. These community efforts provide support for households to meet their food-related needs, while contributing to food sustainability and reduced food wastage in Singapore. Such collaborations are good examples of the impact the community can make and how the community can partner with the Government to support those in need. \"},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mr Desmond Lee: Currently, Assisted Reproduction Technology (ART) centres in Singapore are not allowed to provide surrogacy treatment. We are still carefully reviewing our position on surrogacy, bearing in mind the following considerations.Surrogacy is a complex issue with several ethical, social, health and legal implications. Singapore's public policy encourages parenthood within marriage. Consistent with this, we will generally not object if married couples with fertility problems apply to the Singapore Court to adopt their children born through surrogacy that is carried out overseas. This is provided they are medically assessed to be unable to conceive children, and that the surrogacy arrangement is carried out in a jurisdiction where surrogacy is not illegal or unlawful.The Government does not encourage planned and deliberate single parenthood as a lifestyle choice. Hence, as a matter of public policy, we do not support the use of Assisted Reproduction Technology (ART) or surrogacy by singles to conceive children and adopt them. We also do not support the formation of same-sex families through adoption.All adoption applications will continue to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Besides factors concerning the child's well-being, such as parenting practices, family circumstances and available support networks, the circumstances surrounding each application must also be taken into account to ensure that the adoption does not go against public policy.

and (b) what is the Government\\'s assessment of the utility of the above readings to the population vis-á-vis other indices or measures.37 Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources how has the enactment of the Transboundary Haze Pollution Act 2014 enhanced Singapore\\'s response to transboundary haze pollution.Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Haze has affected ASEAN for years. It has been a perennial scourge in our region, affecting millions of people. Haze pollutes the air we breathe and sets back global efforts in tackling climate change. The 2015 fires in Indonesia generated nearly 1 gigatonne of carbon dioxide; more than half of the 1.5 gigatonne that was saved from the increased use of renewable energy by the whole world for that year. A study by Prof Euston Quah and Assoc Prof Chia Wai Mun from Nanyang Technological University estimated that the cost to Singapore of the two-month long 2015 haze episode was $1.83 billion or 0.45% of our GDP, taking into account factors such as health cost, loss in productivity, and impact on tourism and business. This year, fires in Indonesia have released 360 million tonnes of carbon dioxide since August, more than Spain\\'s emissions for the whole of 2018. Lives have been lost, and the health and livelihoods of millions impacted.The Government adopts a multi-pronged approach to tackle transboundary haze and mitigate its impact on Singaporeans. First, we have been undertaking diplomatic and regional efforts to tackle the haze problem. As early as April, I have written to my Indonesian counterpart to convey Singapore\\'s readiness to assist Indonesia in tackling land and forest fires. When the haze situation in Singapore worsened in September, CEO of National Environment Agency (NEA) wrote to his counterpart on 16 September to convey concerns about the haze situation and details of the fire-fighting assets that Singapore could activate to help Indonesia deal with the escalating number of hotspots. We also sent Indonesia a diplomatic note on the same day. On 19 September, CEO (NEA) wrote again to his counterpart after Indonesia announced that it had sealed off plantations operated by several companies, including Singapore-registered ones, after detecting fires in their concessions. CEO (NEA) requested for the offences committed and further information from the Indonesian government to support NEA\\'s investigations. We sent Indonesia a diplomatic note on 20 September expressing our concerns over the escalation of hotspots and sought their assistance to enhance measures on the ground to prevent and mitigate the occurrence of forest and land fires. Additionally, CEO (NEA) wrote on 4 October to his counterpart to further request information on all companies suspected of intentionally burning land. We have yet to receive any response from the Indonesian Government thus far.Singapore is supportive of the Indonesian Government\\'s continuing efforts to suppress the forest and land fires. We recognise President Joko Widodo\\'s personal attention and efforts in tackling this problem. The key is to prevent the fires from starting in the first place. Errant individuals and companies whose actions jeopardise the health and lives of people in ASEAN and which set back our efforts to fight climate change must be held accountable. Strong enforcement action must be taken against perpetrators and to deter others.  Singapore also works closely with other ASEAN member states to monitor hotspot activities to support measures to reduce fires. For more than two decades, the ASEAN Specialised Meteorological Centre (ASMC), which Singapore hosts, has been sharing regional weather and haze outlook, and satellite information with ASEAN Member States. The ASMC plays a critical regional role. Its technical assessments and updates on the haze situation, along with the ASMC\\'s meteorological forecasts and data on hotspot activities, support efforts to prevent, detect and fight fires. In addition, Singapore is helping fellow ASEAN member states build their capability in haze monitoring as well as weather and climate prediction. Singapore has contributed $5 million to the ASMC for a five-year regional capability building programme.But we also need greater urgency and political resolve, as well as closer cooperation amongst ASEAN countries and stakeholders if we are to make progress towards a haze-free ASEAN. This is why Singapore has been participating actively and contributing at all regional haze-related meetings, such as the 21st meeting of the Sub-Regional Ministerial Steering Committee (MSC) on Transboundary Haze Pollution held in Brunei on 6 August. The MSC is an annual Ministerial-level meeting which is convened in the run-up to the dry season in the Southern ASEAN region. This year\\'s meeting noted the ASMC\\'s report about the potential escalation of hotspot activities and increased risk of transboundary haze due to drier and warmer weather. I reminded ASEAN member states that transboundary haze remained a major concern for the region and the need for preparedness. MSC member countries – Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand – had reaffirmed their readiness to enhance cooperation and coordination to address land and forest fires. At the same meeting, MSC member countries also reaffirmed their commitment to the objectives and principles of the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution (AATHP) and the Roadmap on ASEAN Cooperation towards Transboundary Haze Pollution Control with Means of Implementation. The 10 ASEAN countries, which are signatories to the AATHP, will meet in Cambodia on 8 to 9 October 2019 to take stock of the implementation of the Agreement and discuss how to further enhance its implementation. Senior Minister of State Dr Amy Khor will lead the Singapore delegation at the coming meeting. She will reiterate our concerns about the detrimental effects of haze, its impact on climate change and global emissions of greenhouse gas, and urge all ASEAN member states to take strong action to prevent the recurrence of haze.Second, recognising that strong enforcement on the ground is needed to prevent the recurrent fires, Singapore enacted the Transboundary Haze Pollution Act (THPA) in 2014 to send a strong signal that we will not tolerate the irresponsible actions of errant companies, whether Singapore-based or otherwise, that harm our environment. In 2015, NEA issued legal notices under the THPA to six companies to take immediate measures to stop the fires that caused haze that affected Singapore. Two of the companies have responded and explained that they were no longer associated with the affected lands. Upon further investigation, NEA accepted their explanation and closed these two cases. As for the other four companies, their cases are still open. A director of one of these companies was served a THPA Notice to be interviewed by NEA when he was in Singapore. When he failed to turn up for the interview, a court warrant was obtained to secure his attendance when he next enters Singapore. NEA is on the lookout for other directors of these companies, and will similarly require them to assist in the investigations when they are in Singapore.Singapore therefore welcomes the Indonesian Ministry of the Environment and Forestry\\'s efforts to pursue action against errant companies culpable for the fires, subjecting them to the full extent of the law, and pursuing necessary evidence to do so. As mentioned earlier, CEO (NEA) has written to his Indonesian counterpart to request for more information pertaining to this year\\'s fires, so that we can investigate on our end. For this year\\'s haze episode, NEA is closely monitoring the situation and will update as appropriate. We hope that the Indonesian Government will work with Singapore and other countries in the region by sharing substantiated information that could help identify companies suspected of causing fires. Indonesia should also publish information on land ownership and concession boundaries that can help ascertain which companies are involved. Indonesia\\'s cooperation in this will be useful and necessary in providing the evidence of wrongdoing by any company that has contributed to haze in Singapore.  The THPA complements the efforts of Indonesia and other countries to hold companies to account and is not intended to replace their laws and enforcement actions. We respect the sovereignty of others but States also have a responsibility to ensure that the activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction. Given that these fires occur abroad, regional cooperation remains crucial in resolving transboundary haze pollution. We are pleased that Malaysia is also considering similar legislation. We remain committed to work with other countries to find a solution, as well as collaborate through ASEAN and other international platforms such as the UN.The THPA is not a panacea or the only tool to fight transboundary haze. Although none of the investigated companies has been prosecuted yet, the THPA has nevertheless put added pressure on companies to behave responsibly. We have no plans to amend the THPA at this moment.Third, consumer choices and demand play a crucial role in shaping the practices of forestry and palm oil industries. As more consumers opt for sustainable products, this will incentivise companies to adopt more sustainable practices which in turn contributes to reducing haze. For example, under the World Wildlife Fund Singapore\\'s Southeast Asia Alliance on Sustainable Palm Oil (SASPO), efforts are being led by the industry and there is growing momentum towards adopting sustainable and responsible practices. The Singapore Environment Council (SEC) has established the enhanced Singapore Green Labelling Scheme (SGLS+) to help consumers identify sustainable pulp and paper. This certification demands full disclosure of the company\\'s supply chain, imposes the legal sourcing of all fibre, has a zero-burning policy and includes fire and peatland management. Assessment is done through site audits, evaluation and risk assessments of companies\\' concession lands. As of 26 September 2019, 10 companies have achieved the SGLS+ certification. SEC will take punitive actions such as revocation of certification if there is proof of wrongdoing relating to companies of SGLS+ certified pulp and paper products. Financial institutions can exercise influence over regional forestry and palm oil companies, and promote the adoption of sustainable practices through their lending and investment activities. The Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) released a set of responsible financing guidelines in October 2015, comprising environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria. In 2017, the ABS released the Haze Diagnostic Kit which provides best practices guidelines for member banks to assess their clients\\' commitments to haze risk management. To support climate-related disclosures, the Singapore Exchange introduced the \"Comply or Explain\" Sustainability Reporting Guide for listed companies, beginning from the financial year ending on or after 31 December 2017. Another important signal is that our investment entities do not invest in errant companies. Temasek Holdings has stated publicly that they consider ESG factors when making decisions as an investor looking to deliver returns on a sustainable basis and they fully support no burn policies for land clearance. GIC has also stated that they integrate sustainability considerations holistically into their investment processes.Fourth, to provide the public with timely information to safeguard their health and well-being, NEA has been issuing daily advisories on the haze situation since 4 August this year. The daily advisories provide the forecast of the Pollutant Standards Index or PSI for the next 24 hours which could be used as the basis for major decisions, such as school closure. This is in addition to the 1-hour PM2.5 levels and 24-hour PSI which are updated every hour and are available online and on the MyENV mobile application. During transboundary haze episodes, PM2.5 is the dominant pollutant and has the most influence on the PSI. The 1-hour PM2.5 levels provide an indicative measure of the current air quality, and is a useful indicator to guide immediate activities, such as whether or not to exercise outdoors. Fifth, to minimise the impact of haze on the public, the Government has since 1994 set up a Haze Task Force (HTF), comprising 28 Government agencies. This is led by NEA. The HTF convened in early May this year, before the dry season, to begin preparations for a potential haze situation. With the onset of haze in mid-September, the HTF agencies have been rolling out actions to protect the health and well-being of the public, especially the more vulnerable groups such as the elderly, pregnant women, children, and people with chronic lung and heart diseases. MOH worked with our healthcare institutions, including public hospitals, polyclinics and nursing homes, to prepare for any increase in the number of cases of haze-related conditions and on the timely activation of haze preparedness measures. These measures include using air purifiers and fans, and reducing ambient temperature by deploying portable air coolers where appropriate. Our public healthcare institutions are also monitoring patients closely for possible health effects of the haze and will institute appropriate medical intervention where necessary.In addition, all classrooms of Primary and Secondary schools, MOE Kindergartens and Special Education schools have been equipped with air purifiers to enhance the well-being of students during a haze situation. Teachers will also be on the look-out for students who are unwell or have pre-existing lung or heart conditions. Contingency plans are in place should there be haze during the examinations period.The HTF has also ensured that additional stocks of N95 masks are pushed out to retail shops, and there are sufficient stocks in the warehouses and Government stockpiles. The Singapore Government has a national stockpile of 16 million N95 masks. The HTF has plans in place to distribute N95 masks to vulnerable and needy residents if the 24-hour PSI crosses into the \"Very Unhealthy\" (PSI 201-300) range. N95 masks are, however, not required for short exposure, like commuting from home to school or work, or in an indoor environment. The elderly, pregnant women and those with severe lung or heart problems who have difficulty breathing at rest or on exertion should consult their doctor as to whether they should use the N95 mask.We have considered cloud-seeding but there is a lack of reliable means to validate its effectiveness for Singapore. Given our small size and the variability of winds, the induced rain, if any, may not fall directly over our island. In the first half of October, the Southwest Monsoon is expected to transition to inter-monsoon conditions characterised by light and variable winds and increased showers. Some parts of the region can still experience periods of dry weather in October, and hotspot activities may persist in parts of Sumatra and Kalimantan. However, the change in wind conditions will help to reduce the risk of transboundary haze affecting Singapore.NEA will continue to monitor the haze situation closely. For updates, members of the public can visit the NEA website (www.nea.gov.sg), MSS website (www.weather.gov.sg), the haze microsite (www.haze.gov.sg), mobile apps (myEnv and Weather@SG) or follow NEA Facebook (www.facebook.com/NEASingapore) and NEA Twitter (@NEAsg).

       "  'question': 'Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for National Development (a) in the past five years, what is the number of cases of illegal subletting in private properties; (b) whether there is a need to enhance the awareness of private property owners about illegal subletting; and (c) whether the Ministry has any plans to further strengthen the policing of illegal subletting and take stronger legal action against agents, tenants or landlords who illegally sublet their properties.',\n",
       "  'answer': 'Mr Lawrence Wong: Subletting of private residential properties is only allowed for stays of at least three consecutive months. There is also an occupancy cap of six unrelated persons in each unit.In the past five years, URA investigated an average of about 600 cases involving suspected breaches of the minimum stay duration and an average of over a thousand cases of suspected breaches of the occupancy cap each year. In condominium developments, URA works closely with Management Corporations to raise awareness of the minimum stay duration and occupancy cap among homeowners and to identify units suspected to be in breach of the regulations. Where an offence is established, URA will take appropriate action against those responsible. These include not just direct perpetrators, but also landlords who fail to exercise the necessary due diligence to prevent infringements in their properties, even if the offence was carried out by the tenant.For marginal breaches of the regulations, URA may issue a composition fine of up to $5,000. Since May 2019, URA has issued 23 composition fines for illegal subletting offences. Recalcitrant and serious offenders, for example, those operating on a commercial scale, will be prosecuted in Court and face significantly heavier penalties upon conviction, such as fines of up to $200,000 or imprisonment of up to 12 months. Since the implementation of these measures, 18 individuals and companies have been prosecuted in court for illegal subletting offences. Of these offenders, 11 have been convicted and sentenced to fines as high as $70,000. Another seven cases are currently before the Courts. Several of these cases were reported in the media. We will continue to raise awareness of the regulations, as well as the penalties faced by those who breach them.Apart from property owners and tenants, action will be taken against other parties responsible for illegal subletting offences. For example, where estate agents are found to be complicit in such offences, CEA will take action, which could include revoking the registration of the agent or debarring them for a period of time. MOM will also take enforcement action against errant employers who house foreign workers in poor living conditions. URA will continue to step up its investigation and enforcement efforts.'},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: From 2014 to 2018, the National Environmental Agency (NEA) conducted an average of 1.3 million inspections annually, which uncovered more than 17,000 mosquito breeding habitats each year. The most common mosquito breeding habitats found in homes were domestic containers, such as pails, dish trays, flower pot plates and ornamental containers such as vases. The most common habitats detected in common areas were closed perimeter drains, discarded receptacles and gully traps.NEA takes a systematic and holistic approach to arrest dengue transmission in Singapore. NEA conducts Gravitrap surveillance, regular inspections of premises for potential breeding sites and intensive search-and-destroy operations to remove mosquito breeding habitats. Through NEA's public communication efforts and the support of grassroots organisations, most residents understand the danger of dengue transmission and have been cooperative in facilitating NEA's home inspections. For premises which NEA officers are unable to gain access to, for example when no one is at home, NEA will serve a letter to the owner or occupier to arrange for another date to inspect the unit. If our officers are still unable to enter the premises at the next inspection, a legal notice under section 35 of the Control of Vectors and Pesticides Act (CVPA) will be served to the occupiers, requiring them to open their homes for inspection at a specified time. If the owners or occupiers still fail to contact NEA and all attempts to contact the owners or occupiers via neighbours, grassroots, neighbourhood police and official records again fail, NEA will invoke section 36 of the CVPA to gain entry into the premises to check for mosquito breeding. From 2014 to 2018, 214 homes were inspected under section 36 of the CVPA.We need to remain vigilant and continue to work as a community to prevent mosquito breeding and keep dengue transmission in check. Everyone can play a part in preventing dengue by regularly doing the five-step Mozzie Wipeout. \"},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: There are currently two licensed establishments in Singapore that rear insects. One of them is licensed by the Animal & Veterinary Service (AVS) as it rears insects for pet food.The other is licensed by the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) as it rears insects to produce animal feed. This establishment rears Black Soldier Fly Larvae (BSFL) using waste streams from local food manufacturing companies such as okara, a by-product of soybean milk and tofu manufacturing, and spent brewery grains. The BSFL are processed into aquaculture feed for fish.As part of the licensing requirements for establishments rearing insects to produce animal feed, SFA requires that the substances used to feed the insects are properly handled and traceable to ensure the safety of insect-derived animal feed.Insects can be a good alternative source of feed for animals reared for food, due to their high feed conversion efficiency. This also supports Singapore's efforts to pursue circular economy approaches to reduce waste and be more environmentally sustainable. However, insect farming is still a developing field. SFA is closely monitoring developments in this area, such as rearing practices, research and scientific literature, as well as relevant regulations adopted by overseas regulatory authorities. SFA will continue to refine its regulations and support for insect farming in Singapore.\"},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mr Lawrence Wong: Between 2014 and 2018, the mean and median mortgage service ratios (MSRs) of HDB housing loans disbursed at key collection were similar – these ratios have been stable at around 20% for new flat purchases and 25% for resale flat purchases. As flat buyers are required to dispose of any existing property after they collect the keys to their flat, they will be servicing an HDB housing loan for a single flat.The Mortgage Servicing Ratio (MSR) cap of 30% of flat buyers' income is one of the criteria used to determine the maximum loan amount that flat buyers are eligible for when they apply for a housing loan to purchase an HDB flat or executive condominium. However, some flat buyers choose to shorten their loan tenure to minimise interest costs. For a small number of such flat buyers, around 3% of those who collected keys to their HDB flats in 2018, while their approved loan amount adheres to the MSR cap over the maximum applicable loan tenure, their mortgage instalment over the shortened loan tenure may exceed 30% of their monthly income.  \"},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mr Desmond Lee: Whilst MSF does not track the number of Singapore residents specifically experiencing food insecurity, we support low-income households in a number of ways, including with their food-related needs. When people apply to the Social Service Offices (SSOs) for assistance under ComCare, their needs are assessed holistically – finances, food, healthcare, employment, family-relationship issues, and housing. When ComCare financial assistance is provided, it includes provision for food. Based on the assessed needs, SSOs may also link families with other Government agencies and social service agencies for other forms of support. One example is MOH's Meals-on-Wheels programme, which provides cooked meal deliveries to eligible clients who are unable to buy and prepare their own meals.The community plays a strong role in complementing the Government's efforts on food issues. MSF is aware of more than 20 registered charities and a growing number of informal groups in Singapore providing a variety of food support, including cooked meals, dry rations, and perishables, such as bread and vegetables. Apart from such charities, grassroots organisations and religious organisations such as mosques, churches and temples also provide free food to those in need. These organisations and informal groups are largely volunteer-driven and collaborate closely with community agencies such as Family Service Centres in their food collection and distribution. These community efforts provide support for households to meet their food-related needs, while contributing to food sustainability and reduced food wastage in Singapore. Such collaborations are good examples of the impact the community can make and how the community can partner with the Government to support those in need. \"},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mr Desmond Lee: Currently, Assisted Reproduction Technology (ART) centres in Singapore are not allowed to provide surrogacy treatment. We are still carefully reviewing our position on surrogacy, bearing in mind the following considerations.Surrogacy is a complex issue with several ethical, social, health and legal implications. Singapore's public policy encourages parenthood within marriage. Consistent with this, we will generally not object if married couples with fertility problems apply to the Singapore Court to adopt their children born through surrogacy that is carried out overseas. This is provided they are medically assessed to be unable to conceive children, and that the surrogacy arrangement is carried out in a jurisdiction where surrogacy is not illegal or unlawful.The Government does not encourage planned and deliberate single parenthood as a lifestyle choice. Hence, as a matter of public policy, we do not support the use of Assisted Reproduction Technology (ART) or surrogacy by singles to conceive children and adopt them. We also do not support the formation of same-sex families through adoption.All adoption applications will continue to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Besides factors concerning the child's well-being, such as parenting practices, family circumstances and available support networks, the circumstances surrounding each application must also be taken into account to ensure that the adoption does not go against public policy. It should thus not be taken as a matter of course that applications to adopt children born overseas and outside of wedlock would be successful.\"},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Hospital visitation by relatives and friends are allowed, subject to considerations such as the patient's medical condition, visiting hours and restrictions on number of visitors at bedside to minimise disruptions. Where the patient has mental capacity, decisions on his healthcare and treatment plans rests with the patient himself. Under the Mental Capacity Act (MCA), individuals can make a Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) to appoint anyone they trust as their donees, to make decisions relating to their personal welfare, in the event that they lose mental capacity. Such donees can make decisions relating to the individuals' healthcare and treatment, such as hospital visitation, but excludes certain key medical decisions, such as sterilisation and continuation or cessation of life-sustaining treatments. A deputy may also be appointed by the court under MCA to make certain decisions on behalf of an individual who lacks mental capacity, when the individual has not made a LPA, and has no donee to make decisions on his behalf.

       "  'answer': \"Mr Desmond Lee: Civil servants are eligible for up to two days of parent-care leave per year, and they have the flexibility to take this leave in full or half day blocks. In 2017 and 2018, the percentage of eligible officers who took up parent-care leave was 43% and 44% respectively. More companies have offered paid parent-care leave over time. From an MOM survey, 20% of companies in the private sector offered such leave benefits in 2018, up from 15% in 2012.  To further support employees with unexpected care needs, the tripartite partners have also encouraged more employers to adopt the Tripartite Standard on Unpaid Leave for Unexpected Care Needs, regardless of whether they already provide parent-care leave. Today, 700 companies employing about 250,000 workers have adopted this Standard. Care-givers have given feedback to the Government that they prefer flexible work arrangements (FWAs) over parental leave, as a more sustainable way to balance work and care-giving responsibilities. Arrangements such as telecommuting or flexible working hours provide caregivers with greater flexibility if they need to take some time away from work for ad hoc parental care duties.Employees have greater access to FWAs today. More than nine in 10 employees today work in companies that provide some form of work flexibility. Among those who needed FWAs, more than eight in 10 employees had access to the FWA that they needed. To encourage more companies to meet their employees' FWA needs, MOM increased the Work-Life Grant budget from $30 million to $100 million in July 2019.

We do not condone selective coverage or cherry-picking of employees based on their personal characteristics by insurers.

       "  'answer': \"Mr Heng Swee Keat: The Ministry of Finance takes budget marksmanship seriously as part of its work in ensuring sound financial management. The accuracy of budgeted estimates for Operating Revenue (excluding Net Investment Returns Contribution) and Government Expenditure (excluding Special Transfers) is tracked as part of the Ministry of Finance's Key Performance Indicators, published in the annual Budget documents.Overall, the variances of our projections have been within a reasonable range. From FY2014 to FY2018 (revised), the average variance between our eventual outturns and forecasts was under 3% for revenues, and under 2% for expenditures. These are comparable to those in Hong Kong, Korea and New Zealand, where average revenue and expenditure forecast variances range from 2% to 6% and 1% to 3% respectively for the same period. Forecasting is an inherently uncertain exercise, in particular for a small and open economy like Singapore. The more significant differences from our past projections have tended to be driven by revenues that are influenced by economic volatility and market sentiments. In FY2017, for example, there was an exceptionally high Statutory Board Contribution from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) (+$4.6 billion) and Stamp Duty (+$2.2 billion). The former was driven by unexpected investment gains from a global rally in equity and bond markets. The latter was the result of an unexpected pick-up in property market transactions. When there were unexpected surpluses, we have deployed them for the public good, saving them for anticipated spending needs and sharing some of the surpluses with Singaporeans. For example, arising from the unexpected surplus from FY2017, we set aside funds in a Rail Infrastructure Fund to support plans for future MRT development. We also announced a one-off $700 million SG Bonus to share the surpluses with Singaporeans. Our approach to budgeting is a prudent and citizen-centric one. We plan for sufficient revenues to meet the needs of our people across each term of Government. Any surpluses are invested to yield long-term returns. Up to half of these returns on our net assets are then channeled into future budgets to meet growing needs in areas from education to healthcare, support for our seniors, and keeping our home safe and secure.\"},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): Some media reports might have given the impression that the European Commission (EC) is reducing its market access to financial institutions in Singapore. This is not true. There continues to be no impediment, for financial services provided out of Singapore to customers in the European Union (EU). There has also been no impact on investors' confidence in Singapore. Let me explain. The EC's decision covers only Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) and does not extend to any other financial services. Further, the EC recognises CRAs in a third country through two approaches: First, deeming the third country's CRA rules as equivalent to EC rules. This is called the equivalence decision; Second, an endorsement approach, where the CRAs in the third country rely on their related entities in the EU to endorse their ratings. CRAs in Singapore have been using the endorsement approach, and the EC has confirmed that it will continue to recognise Singapore-based CRAs using this approach.    Having said that, equivalence is the highest form of market integration, which CRAs in Singapore, like those in several other jurisdictions, no longer enjoy. The reason has to do with the different approaches taken by major regulators internationally.On how the Monetary Authority of Singapore's (MAS) regulations on CRAs compare to those in the EU, MAS' CRA regulatory regime is based on, and consistent with, standards promulgated by the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), which is the global standard setting body. The EC has assessed MAS' CRA regulatory regime to be less prescriptive than EU rules in certain areas, such as in defining specific situations in which a conflict of interest for the CRA arises. MAS takes a more principles-based approach. It nevertheless requires conflicts of interest to be effectively addressed, and is fully in line with international standards and appropriate to our context and needs.Singapore is in good standing with the EU. We have EC recognition on a broad range of other financial services, including for over-the-counter derivatives trading venues and central counterparties. In July 2019, we were one of the first two jurisdictions to obtain EC equivalence for financial benchmarks regulation. MAS will continue to closely engage our EU counterparts in reviewing our rules to ensure that financial institutions in Singapore continue to have access to the EU market in various financial services.\"},\n",

In 2013, two days of childcare leave were also extended to parents with children aged seven to 12, recognising that parents with children in primary school would also need time to tend to their children's needs. More days of childcare leave are granted to parents of younger children in the earlier years of their development as they require relatively more care from parents, compared to children in primary school. We have taken a practical approach to calibrating the childcare leave provisions for parents with young children, balancing the caregiving needs of parents with the manpower and operational needs of employers.

       "  'answer': 'Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): The International Monetary Fund (IMF), in its recent assessment of the Singapore\\'s financial system under its Financial Sector Assessment Programme, reaffirmed Singapore\\'s financial sector oversight to be \"among the best globally\".  Specifically, it concluded that the Monetary Authority of Singapore\\'s (MAS) supervision of payment systems, namely – MAS Electronic Payment System (MEPS+), Fast And Secure Transfers (FAST), Inter-bank GIRO, Singapore Dollar Cheque Clearing, and the NETS Electronic Funds Transfer at Point of Sale (EFTPOS) – was in line with international standards, and appropriate and effective.Notwithstanding, in anticipation of evolving systemic risks in the payments landscape, the IMF had recommended that MAS increase its resources for the supervision of payment systems. MAS\\' thinking is the same as the IMF\\'s on this matter. MAS has indeed been allocating additional resources for supervision of payment activities and implementing enhancements to its supervisory programme. These include leveraging data analytics capabilities, and applying appropriate standards to retail payment systems in line with their changing systemic importance. MAS will continue to watch developments in the payments landscape and ensure its capabilities and supervisory approaches are appropriate.'},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mr Heng Swee Keat (for the Prime Minister): Startups are an important catalyst and driver of innovation and enterprise in our economy. The Government has put in place a range of schemes to catalyse funding into Singapore startups across different stages of their development.One such scheme is the Early Stage Venture Fund (ESVF), which aims to catalyse venture capital (VC) funding for early-stage Singapore-based high-tech startups. The scheme has evolved over the past decade in line with the needs of our startups, as our eco-system developed. The scheme catalysed the formation of 10 early-stage venture capital (VC) funds and four Corporate Venture Funds, and has invested in more than 60 Singapore-based high-technology startups  More recently, the ESVF scheme supported the formation of the National Research Foundation Singapore (NRF)-Temasek IP Commercialisation Vehicle, announced at Budget 2018, to co-invest in startups underpinned by intellectual property generated from publicly-funded Research and Development (R&D). Of the startups that received investments catalysed by ESVF, about two-thirds have progressed significantly, in that they have either crossed $250,000 in revenue, raised more than $250,000 in third party investments, or increased their valuation by at least 20%.  Aslan Pharmaceuticals and De.Mem are two such startups which have benefitted from the ESVF scheme: (a) Aslan Pharmaceuticals is a biotechnology company that develops therapies for cancer tumour types prevalent in Asia. Having received more than $4 million in investments catalysed by ESVF, it has listed on both the Taipei Exchange and NASDAQ, raising more than US$75 million in the process. Aslan is headquartered in Singapore, with offices in Taiwan and Shanghai. (b) De.Mem is a company providing solutions for drinking water generation, municipal sewage treatment and industrial wastewater treatment in decentralised applications. It is a spin-off from the Nanyang Environment and Water Research Institute (NEWRI) at NTU, having licensed Forward Osmosis and Nanofiltration membrane technologies from NEWRI. De.Mem, which had received around $3.5 million in investments catalysed by ESVF, has now achieved a S$25 million (A$27 million) market capitalisation and has operations in Singapore, Australia and Vietnam. Besides the ESVF, NRF has also co-invested in high-technology startups since 2008 through two other schemes – the Technology Incubation Scheme (TIS) in partnership with startup incubators, and the Distruptive Incubator Scheme (DIS), which operated as an incubator investment fund. Then-SPRING also invested in startups through the SEEDS Capital, which was started in 2001. Collectively, these schemes have made investments into more than 400 startups. Beyond funding support, the Government has taken other steps to grow a conducive environment for startups. Startup SG, administered by Enterprise Singapore, has consolidated all the startup-facing support from the Government into a one-stop shop. This includes providing startups with access to mentorship, talent, local and global networks, co-innovation platforms and infrastructure, in order to build their capabilities and grow. Through these efforts, Singapore's startup ecosystem is becoming more vibrant. We have seen positive growth in the local tech startup eco-system. A decade ago, less than 70 VC investments were closed in Singapore in a year. This has grown to more than 350 last year. The Government will continue to grow an enabling, pro-enterprise environment for startups.  \"},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Under the Parking Places Act, operators are required to obtain a licence to offer dockless PMD-sharing services that operate in a public place. This is to prevent indiscriminate parking of shared devices. While the licensing regime does not cover PMD-sharing operators who deploy their devices solely on private land, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) engages these operators proactively to understand their deployment plans and advise them on our regulations. LTA's enforcement officers conduct regular patrols based on these plans and at known hotspots to detect illegal deployment. Operators who operate illegally without a licence may be fined up to $10,000 and/or be imprisoned for up to six months. LTA will also impound shared PMDs that are illegally deployed, and take all contraventions into account if the operator decides to apply for a device-sharing licence.All device-sharing operators, regardless of whether they operate on public or private land, must do their part to ensure users ride safely and park properly.

Where an offence was established, URA has taken appropriate action against the perpetrators. These offenders include both property owners and tenants. They come from a wide range of age groups, and are mostly Singaporeans. URA has found that while some offenders are responsible for a large number of STA listings, they typically do not own those properties, but instead rent from the owners and then sublet them illegally to short-term occupants. For such cases, property owners will also be held liable for the infringements occurring in their properties, even if the offending use was carried out by the tenant. For those renting out homes on a casual basis, and caught for the first time, URA will impose a composition fine, of up to $5,000. Since May 2019, URA has issued 14 composition fines.

       "  'answer': 'Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The Government adopts a multi-pronged approach to reduce the risk and impact of transboundary haze on Singapore. In Singapore, the National Environment Agency (NEA) continuously monitors the ambient air quality and has been issuing daily advisories to the public on the haze situation since 4 August this year. NEA also chairs an inter-agency Haze Task Force to monitor the haze situation closely during dry seasons and to implement action plans to mitigate the effects of haze should Singapore be affected.  Within the region, Singapore works closely with other ASEAN member states to monitor hotspot activities and undertake measures to reduce forest fires. The ASEAN Specialised Meteorological Centre (ASMC), which Singapore hosts, shares meteorological and hotspots forecasts with ASEAN member states. ASMC has also set aside $5 million over the next five years to help ASEAN member states. In addition, the lack of haze in Singapore over the last two years is in no small part due to Indonesia\\'s extensive and continuous efforts to minimise the number of hotspots within the country.Nevertheless, we have been observing persistent hotspot activities in the surrounding region in the past few weeks. Singapore is currently in the Southwest Monsoon season and the NEA is forecasting drier conditions in the coming weeks. These conditions can lead to an escalation of hotspot activities and an increased risk of transboundary haze in Singapore and the surrounding region. At the recent 21st meeting of the Sub-Regional Ministerial Steering Committee (MSC) on Transboundary Haze Pollution in Brunei on 6 August, Singapore and other member countries (Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand) noted the report by the ASEAN Specialised Meteorological Centre about the potential escalation of hotspot activities in fire-prone areas and increased risk of transboundary haze due to drier and warmer weather. These countries also noted that transboundary haze pollution remains a major concern for the region, and reaffirmed their readiness to enhance cooperation and coordination to address land and forest fires. Singapore has offered technical firefighting assistance to Indonesia and is ready to deploy them, as we did so in 2015, if requested by Indonesia.  At the same meeting, MSC member countries also reaffirmed our commitment to the objectives and principles of the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution and the Roadmap on ASEAN Cooperation towards Transboundary Haze Pollution Control with Means of Implementation.

Building developers are encouraged to use green building materials, such as low emissions building products certified by the Singapore Green Building Council or Singapore Environmental Council. Indoor environmental quality and the use of green building materials are an integral part of the assessment of a building's environmental performance, to be certified under the Building and Construction Authority's (BCA) Green Mark schemes.Building owners and facility managers should also take guidance from the Singapore Standard Code of Practice for Indoor Air Quality for Air-Conditioned Buildings (SS 554), which specifies good practices in managing IAQ as well as the standards and limits of IAQ parameters. Supplementing the SS 554 are the Workplace Safety and Health Guidelines on Management of Indoor Air Quality in Air-Conditioned Workplaces published by the Workplace Safety and Health Council, which provides guidance to building owners and facility managers on the implementation of IAQ management programmes in workplaces.The National Environment Agency (NEA) conducts IAQ surveys in public places and monitors public feedback on IAQ. The surveys show that most of the causes of poor IAQ are linked to factors, such as the use of furnishings or products with high volatile organic chemicals, and inadequate design and maintenance of the building air ventilation system. Hence, NEA has been working closely with relevant agencies to conduct educational sessions on IAQ for building owners and facility managers, to highlight the importance of building ventilation maintenance and raise awareness on choosing low-emissions furnishings or products to maintain good IAQ. NEA also assists building owners and facility managers in identifying the sources or causes of indoor air pollution in their premises, and providing advice on measures to improve IAQ.Building owners, facility managers and occupants all have a role in maintaining good IAQ. Occupants can provide feedback on IAQ to building owners and facility managers to take mitigation measures. Building owners and facility managers should adopt best practices to ensure the buildings are clean and well-ventilated.\"},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Ong Ye Kung: The Ministry of Education (MOE) takes a broader definition of students with Special Educational Needs (SEN). It includes students with learning difficulties, such as dyslexia and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, or with Autism, physical and sensory impairment, who are enrolled in mainstream schools or study in Special Education (SPED) schools like Pathlight using the national curriculum. Those with moderate-to-severe SEN are enrolled in specialised SPED schools, with more assistance and customised teaching and learning approaches. As at December 2018, there were about 32,000 students with reported SEN, with 80% in mainstream schools and 20% in SPED schools. The proportion of students with SEN has increased from about 5% in 2014 to 7% in 2018. The rise in students with SEN is a worldwide trend. Part of this is due to increased awareness and reporting, and better identification by hospitals and schools.Mainstream schools educate students on inclusivity through classroom lessons, as well as school-based programmes that build up peer support. Through these, schools emphasise the importance of values such as respect and care for others, and promote empathy and acceptance of differences. But it is not without challenges and the system is still improving.  SPED schools have established partnerships with mainstream schools to provide social mixing opportunities between the students. An example is the combined community service and co-curricular programmes for students of Bowen Secondary School and AWWA School. MOE, schools and partner organisations also work together to promote inclusivity in the arts and sports. For example, the Play Inclusive programme brought together student-athletes from several SPED and mainstream schools to share sports experiences. SPED students also participate in the National School Games, the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation and the National Day Parade.  '},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mrs Josephine Teo: We do not collect utilisation rate of Flexible Work Arrangements (FWAs) because it does not show if employees require more FWAs or not. A low FWA utilisation rate could be due to employees not requiring FWAs at the point in time. A more useful indicator is the accessibility of FWAs for employees who need it. Among employees aged 25 to 64 who required FWAs in 2018, more than eight in 10 had access to the FWA that they needed, an increase from seven in 10 in 2016.1 The percentage is broadly similar across age and gender.  The Work-Life Grant (WLG) is only disbursed to companies after their employees have regularly utilised the FWAs. The amount disbursed depends on the number of employees who utilised the FWAs, up to $105,000 per company. We do not track the utilisation of FWAs by all employees in each company. However, as part of the WLG conditions, every beneficiary company must adopt the Tripartite Standard on FWAs, which includes informing all their employees on the types of FWAs offered and outcomes of their applications, and engaging them on alternatives if their requests cannot be granted. To provide greater support to companies to implement FWAs, the budget for the enhanced WLG was recently increased to $100 million, up from $30 million. We strongly encourage employers to tap on the grant to offer FWAs to their employees.'},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mrs Josephine Teo: In July 2017, MOM launched the Tripartite Standards to encourage companies to adopt fair and progressive workplace practices. Employers who adopt the Tripartite Standards are publicly recognised as progressive employers. This helps them to attract and retain jobseekers and their current workers. Adoption is voluntary.  Two years on, we have seen significant progress. As of July 2019, about 2,700 employers, including public sector agencies, covering about 670,000 employees, have adopted at least one Tripartite Standard. This means that one in five workers can be assured that their employers have committed to implementing fair and progressive employment practices such as recruiting based on merit, setting out clear terms of engagement, and providing flexible work arrangements.Table 1 below provides a breakdown of the number of employers who have adopted each Tripartite Standard and workers covered. The top three industries with the most adopters of the Tripartite Standards are (i) Infocomm Technology and Media, (ii) Professional Services, and (iii) Wholesale Trade.

       "  'answer': \"Mr Chan Chun Sing: Singapore currently has 24 Free Trade Agreements (FTAs). We are also working with the European Commission to bring the EU-Singapore FTA (EUSFTA), which was ratified by the European Parliament in February 2019, into force at the end of 2019.1 In addition, we are negotiating the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which connects all ten ASEAN economies with six other economies accounting for about 30% of global Gross Domestic Product (GDP), as well as FTAs with the Eurasian Economic Union, MERCOSUR, and the Pacific Alliance.Our trade and investment partnerships create opportunities for our economy and strengthen our strategic relations with other countries. A study by the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) estimated that on average, Singapore's domestic exports to an FTA partner increased by 18% two years after its entry into force, and a further 16% in the third year.2 New agreements such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and the EUSFTA can potentially increase Singapore's GDP by up to 0.2% and 0.35% respectively.3 Our FTAs also make it easier for our companies to do business in foreign countries by providing preferential market access for our businesses, including lower tariff and non-tariff barriers for Singapore goods, fewer restrictions for services sectors, and enhanced protection for investments.  Beyond market access benefits, FTAs also establish common enforceable rules that provide certainty for businesses. For instance, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership's (CPTPP) rules for intellectual property rights and e-commerce help attract research and development, and spur the growth of transformative digital services that we all enjoy today.  MTI regularly reviews our trade agreements to account for new business models and regulations. With the rapid growth of the digital economy, we have started negotiating digital economy agreements with Chile and New Zealand, as well as a collaboration with Australia. We also upgrade our FTAs in light of changing economic circumstances. For instance, we upgraded our FTA with China in November 2018, to provide our businesses with enhanced investment protection, greater access to China’s legal, maritime and construction services sectors, and improved Rules of Origin for petrochemical and plastics exports.\"},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease (HFMD) is a common childhood illness. Most children recover from HFMD on their own without treatment. As HFMD infections are not reportable and the majority are mild, the Ministry of Health (MOH) does not track the number or percentage of children who have contracted HFMD and the number of times they have contracted the disease during their life. As HFMD can be caused by different viruses, infection by one virus does not confer immunity to other viruses. As such, a person who has recovered from HFMD may be infected again. The key to controlling the spread of HFMD is to maintain high standards of personal and environmental hygiene, and to seek medical treatment early when the child is unwell. MOH works closely with the Ministry of Education (MOE), Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) and People's Association (PA) to ensure that educational institutions, including childcare centres, remain vigilant and take measures to minimise the spread of infectious diseases.

Since 2017, fathers have been eligible for two weeks of GPPL (doubled from one week previously), and up to four weeks of SPL (increased from one week previously), shared from their spouse's Maternity Leave. The estimated percentages of fathers who did not take at least one day of GPPL or SPL in the last five years are shown in Tables 1 and 2 below.

The take-up of GPPL increased between 2013 and 2017. More than half of eligible fathers took GPPL in the 2017 cohort. The GPPL take-up for 2018 will likely increase further as fathers can take paternity leave up to one year after their child's birth, and employers then have up to three months after the leave was taken to submit claims.

       "  'answer': \"Mrs Josephine Teo: The Employment Act (EA) stipulates employees' minimum terms and working conditions, including for paid annual leave. It seeks to protect the basic interests of employees while balancing business needs and ensuring employees' employability. Specific to annual leave, the statutory minimum entitlement of seven days applies to employees who have worked with their employer for at least three months, but not more than one year. With each year of service, an employee's statutory entitlement increases, up to 14 days.  Statutory annual leave entitlements vary across developed economies. Some like the United Kingdom and Australia have relatively more generous provisions, while the United States does not have a federal law regulating paid annual leave. The minimum statutory annual leave entitlement in Singapore is comparable to that in jurisdictions such as Hong Kong and Taiwan. Singapore's statutory annual leave entitlements should also be viewed alongside the paid sick leave, childcare leave, and other forms of leave provided for in our laws. Employees can use these other forms of leave over and above their annual leave entitlements. In other jurisdictions, such leave may not be available, or fully paid. The Ministry of Manpower (MOM), together with the tripartite partners, completed a review of the EA in 2018.

Preschool operators take the opportunity to bring their staff together for skills upgrading on a range of topics, such as teaching methods and child management, updates on operational procedures for the safety and well-being of children, as well as team bonding activities.In setting the guidelines on closure days for childcare centres, the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) strives to balance parents' childcare needs and the operational needs of childcare centres. Centres are required to inform parents about closure days at the beginning of each calendar year, and remind parents one month prior to each closure day.

       "  'question': 'Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Education (a) what is the average per-undergraduate student annual expenditure on teaching and educational services broken down by faculty/school for each of the autonomous universities; and (b) what is the breakdown of the source of such expenditure by tuition revenue, government grant and endowment income.',\n",
       "  'answer': 'Mr Ong Ye Kung: Expenditure for undergraduate education varies across the Autonomous Universities (AUs) and course clusters, depending on factors, such as the education model and pedagogy, faculty-to-student ratio for the courses, and the capital costs involved in delivering the course. Courses with better faculty-to-student ratios include the law programmes, while courses with higher capital costs include laboratory-based programmes like computing, science and engineering.For similar courses, the Ministry of Education (MOE) does not vary our funding to AUs based on their expenditure. Instead, we establish a per-student cost norm for similar courses across universities and fund programmes based on these norms. This approach encourages cost discipline across our AUs even as they strive to deliver high quality undergraduate education. Overall, the average Government funding for operating expenses per undergraduate in FY2019 is around $22,000.Government grants continue to be the main source of funding for university education. Students generally pay around 25% of the cost of education. The AUs tap on income from endowment, which is built up with Government matching, to supplement Government funding for their programmes.'},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The National Environmental Agency (NEA) has conducted scientific studies to study the risk of dengue transmission across Singapore. One example is the use of big data and geographic information systems to analyse mosquito breeding and dengue transmission patterns. These studies have found that the risk of dengue transmission increases with higher population density, Aedes aegypti population, extent of urbanisation and historical incidence of dengue. This provides a useful guide for NEA's vector control operations. For instance, before the traditional dengue season every year, NEA deploys additional manpower to areas identified as higher risk to conduct intensive source reduction activities to remove mosquito breeding habitats. Throughout the year, NEA conducts routine inspections and search-and-destroy operations guided by data collected by the Aedes surveillance system, which comprises 50,000 Gravitraps deployed islandwide. Developed in-house, Gravitraps are designed to attract and trap adult female Aedes mosquitoes, the vector responsible for the transmission of dengue, chikungunya and zika. The surveillance system shows that a persistently high Aedes aegypti population increases the risk of localised dengue transmission and the odds of a dengue cluster forming. An additional 14,000 Gravitraps are progressively being deployed to increase the area of coverage. Everyone has a part to play in preventing the spread of dengue. Between January and June this year, about 70% of mosquito breeding habitats detected in dengue clusters were found in homes. The community must play its part and step up the eradication of mosquito breeding habitats by practising the 5-step Mozzie Wipe-out regularly. Effective source reduction by all stakeholders is key to preventing the formation of dengue clusters and disrupting the transmission cycles of the dengue virus in our community.\"},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mr Lawrence Wong: Since April 2014, new buildings that are frequented by families such as transport hubs, sports complexes, community clubs and larger shopping malls of more than 10,000 square metres in gross floor area, are required to provide family-friendly facilities under the Building and Construction Authority's (BCA) Code on Accessibility. Such facilities include lactation rooms and diaper changing stations. Existing buildings which undergo major retrofitting works also need to meet these requirements. To date, about 90 buildings have been newly developed or have undergone major retrofitting, and all have met the requirements. However, the actual number of buildings with family-friendly facilities is likely to be higher, as other building owners may have moved to provide such facilities on their own as part of their renovation works, for example, in malls. BCA does not track such buildings if they did not undergo major retrofitting works. From 2020, lactation rooms will also be required in more building types, including healthcare facilities. BCA provides funding support under the Accessibility Fund for private building owners who wish to retrofit pre-1990 buildings with family-friendly facilities. For each eligible development, the Fund supports up to 60% of the retrofitting cost, up to a cap of $300,000. In addition to funding, BCA also worked with MSF to introduce a voluntary certification scheme in 2018 – the Universal Design Mark for Family-Friendly Business – to recognise businesses that provide family-friendly facilities and services. \"},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Gan Kim Yong: Based on records submitted by care providers to MOH, in the fourth quarter of 2018, around 16,000 Singapore residents were using subsidised home and/or community care services, of which around 7,000 used subsidised home care services. Around six in ten subsidised home care clients were female. Around half were aged 80 and above, around three in ten were aged 70 to 79, and the remainder were aged 69 and below. The vast majority of home care clients would be home-bound with chronic conditions or disabilities, and require assistance with some Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), in particular in the area of mobility.  Around one in ten home care clients also use community-based care services such as day rehabilitation or respite care services. Depending on the needs of patients, the most commonly used home care service is home nursing, which is on average, about $95 per visit before any subsidies and about $20 per visit for a client receiving the maximum subsidy. The Integrated Home and Day Care (IHDC) pilot introduced in 2016 bundles both home- and community-based services, and gives us an estimate of the expenditure of clients using services in both settings together. Depending on the bundle, the fees range between $1,100 to $2,300 per month before any subsidies, and about $300 to $600 per month for a client receiving the maximum subsidy.

Altruistic egg donation is allowed in Singapore. However, due to the invasiveness of the ovarian simulation and egg retrieval procedure, there are a limited number of egg donors. AR practitioners would generally counsel their patients to seek egg donations from relatives or close friends. Alternatively, egg donations can also be received from unrelated donors, and these are frequently from women who are already undergoing their own AR treatment.AR centres are mandated to provide counselling for couples before the start of any treatment, and to discuss, amongst other issues, the couple's wishes regarding the eggs or embryos that remain after their treatment is completed.

As HFMD infections are not reportable and the majority are mild, MOH does not track the number or percentage of children who have contracted HFMD at least once during their life. The key to controlling the spread of HFMD is to maintain high standards of personal and environmental hygiene, and to seek medical treatment early when the child is unwell. MOH works closely with the Ministry of Education (MOE), Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) and People's Association (PA) to ensure that educational institutions, including childcare centres, remain vigilant and take measures to minimise the spread of infectious diseases.

       "  'answer': \"Mrs Josephine Teo: From 2016 to 2018, the Home Protection Scheme (HPS) helped to pay the remaining mortgage for about 3,000 HDB flat owners who passed away, became terminally ill or suffered from total permanent disability. Another 20 claims were unsuccessful as the members' HPS policies had lapsed.We have put in place several measures to minimise the risk that HDB flat owners lapse on their HPS coverage. (a) HPS premiums are automatically deducted from the flat owner's CPF Ordinary Account (OA). This minimises any out-of-pocket payments for the HPS premium.(b) Flat owners can tap on their co-owners' CPF-OA savings to help pay the HPS premium.(c) If flat owners miss their premium payment despite the above measures, CPF Board will offer a two-month grace period for the flat owner to pay the HPS premium. CPF Board will send letters to remind the flat owner to top up his CPF-OA and will prioritise new OA contributions for HPS premiums over mortgage instalments during this grace period. The flat owner's HPS coverage will lapse if he does not pay the premium by the end of the two-month grace period. For flat owners whose coverage has lapsed and are using CPF to pay their mortgage instalments, CPF Board continues to send letters every six months reminding them to re-apply for HPS coverage. In the few cases of unsuccessful claims where the HPS has lapsed, dependants can seek HDB's assistance to reduce or defer mortgage payments until the family regains financial stability, or right-size to a more affordable flat if they choose to do so.\"},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mrs Josephine Teo: The Dependants' Protection Scheme (DPS) is a term-life insurance scheme that provides CPF members and their family a basic level of financial relief at affordable premiums in the event of terminal illness, total permanent disability or death. The decision to offer DPS coverage up till 60 strikes a balance between providing insurance protection for the member's dependants and his need for adequate retirement savings:(a) First, raising the maximum coverage age beyond 60 would result in significantly higher premiums due to higher mortality rates after age 60. DPS premiums are paid out of members' CPF accounts, and paying for significantly higher premiums would compromise members' retirement adequacy. (b) Second, after age 60, the need for DPS is significantly reduced as most members are less likely to have children who are financially dependent. Those who started families later and may still have dependants are likely to have accumulated savings in their CPF accounts which could be bequeathed to their dependants. Members who prefer additional insurance protection may use cash to purchase insurance products from private insurers.

       "  'answer': 'Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Packaging waste, including plastics, is one of the three priority waste streams in Singapore. To tackle this issue, my Ministry and the National Environment Agency (NEA) have adopted a holistic approach to reduce the excessive use of all types of packaging, not just single-use plastics. We do not target plastics alone. The NEA conducted a life-cycle assessment of single-use carrier bags and disposables and found that substituting plastics with other types of single-use packaging materials is not necessarily better for the environment. As such, our focus is to promote the use of reusables. The National Environment Agency (NEA) recently launched the nation-wide \"Say YES to Waste Less\" campaign to drive awareness of the impact of excessive consumption of disposables and the need for reduction. Some 1,600 premises, ranging from retailers, food and beverage establishments, supermarkets, hotels, Community Development Councils, grassroots organisations, schools and non-governmental organisations, have come forward to partner NEA. Partners commit to actions such as prompting customers to bring along reusables, encouraging them to decline disposable cutlery with online orders and displaying campaign visuals at cashier points. NEA has also launched the \\'Towards Zero Waste Grant\\' to support individuals, interest groups, non-Governmental organisations, grassroots organisations and corporations to initiate or scale up waste reduction and recycling initiatives. Moving upstream, starting next year, NEA will require brand owners, manufacturers and importers of packaged goods, as well as supermarkets with an annual turnover exceeding $10 million to report information on the packaging they place on the market, and their plans for reducing, reusing or recycling packaging annually. This will increase companies\\' awareness of the potential for waste reduction in their business operations. Companies should take action to reduce the amount of packaging used, and minimise waste generation at source. This mandatory reporting framework will also lay the foundation for an Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) framework for managing packaging waste including plastics, which NEA will put in place no later than 2025.  Besides reducing waste, we are taking actions to increase our recycling rate. For example, we are working with the industry to tap on the Towards Zero Waste Grant to roll out 50 reverse vending machines starting this year. Through this initiative, we hope to engage the public to consciously recycle used PET bottles and aluminium cans. At the same time, we are developing the local recycling industry. We want to better extract resources from waste and close the waste loop through a circular economy approach. NEA is currently studying recycling solutions and technologies, and assessing their suitability for adoption in Singapore. This may include mechanical recycling to turn waste plastics into plastic pellets for manufacturing new products, or chemical recycling to turn plastic waste into chemical feedstock or fuel. The Government will work with industry stakeholders to explore how these technologies can be applied to Singapore, such that it is both environmentally and economically sustainable. These are efforts which could help grow local enterprises and create good jobs for Singaporeans. Everyone needs to play our part to reduce packaging waste, including single-use plastics. We can do this in different ways. For example, we can opt out of receiving disposable cutlery when ordering food for takeaway or delivery, or we can bring our own reusable bags and containers and take only the plastic bags we need.

       " 419: {'title': 'industry or service sector employing most number of senior workers',\n",
       "  'question': 'Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Manpower (a) which is the industry or service sector that currently employs the most number of senior workers and what is their ratio against the total number of employees; and (b) what are the additional measures that the Ministry will adopt to encourage companies to retain their older workers before they consider applying for foreign workers.',\n",
       "  'answer': \"Mrs Josephine Teo: In 2018, the sector that employed the most number of residents aged 55 and over was Wholesale Trade (54,500), which includes businesses, such as brand owners, distributors of other companies' brands, trading arms of manufacturers and retailers, and large commodities trading houses. These workers accounted for 23% of all employed residents within the sector, which is similar to the overall proportion of employed residents of this age group (24%) in Singapore.To enhance the employability of senior workers, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has in place a number of measures, and these are also regularly reviewed. For instance, the Special Employment Credit (SEC), which has been extended till end 2020, provides wage offsets of up to 11% to employers that hire older Singaporeans aged 55 and above, earning up to $4,000 per month. Employers can also receive support of up to $300,000 per company under the WorkPro Job Redesign Grant to redesign jobs and workplaces to make them easier, safer and smarter for senior workers. Under the Adapt and Grow initiative, the Professional Conversion Programme and Career Support Programme provide higher levels of training and salary support to encourage employers to hire mature Singaporeans aged 40 and above. These pro-senior measures have encouraged and supported companies in hiring older Singaporeans. Over the years, our employment rates of senior workers or residents aged 55 to 64 years have improved significantly. It grew from 57% in 2008 to 67% in 2018, and ranks favourably compared to OECD countries.In addition, we are continuing to calibrate the foreign workforce policy to keep our labour market tight so as to ensure that Singaporeans, especially senior workers, continue to access good jobs and opportunities. We have cut the foreign worker Dependency Ratio Ceiling (DRC) and S Pass sub-DRC in the Services sector to 35% and 10% respectively by 2021. Last year, MOM also convened the Tripartite Workgroup on Older Workers to review retirement and re-employment ages. The Workgroup is finalising its recommendations; more details would be announced by September.  \"},\n",

       "  'question': 'Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Manpower with regard to cases registered for mediation by the Tripartite Alliance Dispute Management in each of the last three years that were then subsequently withdrawn due to payment, part-payment or resolution through a formal settlement agreement (a) what were the respective average and median proportions of the settlement amounts compared to the amounts initially claimed; and (b) how many claimants were not paid the settlement amount in full within four weeks of registering the settlement agreement in the District Court.',\n",
       "  'answer': 'Mrs Josephine Teo: The Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM) has concluded about 15,000 salary claims lodged between April 2017 when it was established and December 2018. Two-thirds of the claims were either resolved through payment from employers in a private settlement or by way of a settlement agreement which when registered with the District Court can be enforceable. Of the remaining one-third, about half were referred to the Employment Claims Tribunals for adjudication as the disputes could not be resolved through mediation, and the other half were withdrawn by the claimants because they found that their claims were weak or invalid.Initial claims are not always accurate or valid. The ratio of settlement to initial claims is therefore not a meaningful indicator. During mediation, TADM mediators will work with the parties involved to verify the actual amount of salary arrears. Claimants may settle for less if the employer is in genuine financial difficulty. Nonetheless, vast majority of the settlements were close to or same as the valid amounts claimed.  Once a settlement agreement has been reached, TADM will actively monitor payment by calling the claimants within three working days of the scheduled payment date, which is arrived at by mutual agreement between the two parties. Sometimes, the claimant is not contactable or cannot remember when he was paid. More importantly, when a claimant reports to TADM that he did not receive any payment after the agreed payment date, TADM will immediately engage the employer concerned and remind the employer to pay up. The matter will also be reported to MOM for possible enforcement follow up.  Ninety-three percent of the claimants have reported that they received full payment based on the settlement amount. Another 4% reported partial payment, and the remaining 3% reported no payment. Enforcement action is taken against all employers who do not pay up, including suspension of their work pass privileges. The more egregious employers are prosecuted. '},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mrs Josephine Teo: S Pass holders in the Services sector are already subject to quotas capped at 15% of the firm's total workforce, (excluding Employment Pass, or EP, holders). This will be reduced to 13% from 1 January 2020, and to 10% from 1 January 2021. Within the Services sector, Food Services has the highest utilisation of S Pass quota. S Pass holders also have to meet minimum qualifying salaries, which are regularly reviewed to reflect local salary changes. This is to ensure locals are not disadvantaged when their wages go up. We updated the S Pass salary criteria in 2019, with a further increase in S Pass qualifying salary to be made in 2020.While we do not subject firms to quotas on the number of EPs they may hire, we require them to consider all applicants fairly. Under the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF), we scrutinise the EP applications of firms suspected to have discriminatory hiring practices, including firms with very high single-nationality concentrations. Those found to have such practices will have their work pass privileges curtailed. Like S Pass holders, EP holders are subject to minimum qualifying salaries, which were updated in 2017.Locals hold the majority of jobs paying above $3,600 (minimum qualifying salary for EPs). In most other sectors, the EP shares are around or below one-quarter with the exception of Infocomm in the Services sector where the share of EPs is about one-third. These ratios may fluctuate but have not trended up in the last few years. Local employment outcomes – employment rates, unemployment rates, wage growth – have remained healthy. We continue to help local jobseekers expand opportunities for career mobility through a range of programmes.  \"},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: In 2018, 763,000 tonnes of food waste was generated. Of this, half was from residential households. The remainder was from other sources, which includes food manufacturers, hotels, shopping malls and hawker centres. The National Environment Agency (NEA) does not track the specific amount of food waste generated from food industries, food and beverage outlets, markets and supermarkets. Food waste segregation and treatment for residential households are currently undertaken on a voluntary basis. From August to October last year, my Ministry conducted a household food waste segregation pilot at Tampines GreenLace. The initial results from the pilot were encouraging and more than 4000 kg of food waste was collected over three months. The pilot has been extended upon the request of residents and my Ministry is currently monitoring the extended pilot together with our partner Zero Waste SG. For commercial and industrial premises, 23 premises have obtained funding support through NEA's 3R Fund to install on-site food waste treatment systems. Another 23 premises have been segregating their food waste and sending it for treatment at the Ulu Pandan Water Reclamation Facility, where it is co-digested with used water sludge. From 2024, my Ministry will require commercial and industrial premises that generate large amounts of food waste to undertake food waste segregation for treatment. From 2021, developers of new developments where large amounts of food waste are expected to be generated will also be required to allocate space for on-site food waste treatment in their building plans. These regulations will be put into effect through the Resource Sustainability Bill that is to be introduced in Parliament.  \"},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mrs Josephine Teo: The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) stipulates provisions under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (EFMA) that safeguard the well-being and employment conditions of foreign domestic workers (FDWs). It requires employers to provide adequate food and rest, as well as proper accommodation with sufficient space and privacy for their FDWs.  Employers of FDWs receive clear guidelines on what constitute adequate food and acceptable accommodation, and these parameters are reflected on the MOM website. For instance, employers must provide FDWs with three meals a day and examples of what the daily food intake could be for breakfast, lunch and dinner are detailed on the MOM website. Employers are also responsible for providing proper lodging that accords adequate shelter, basic amenities, sufficient ventilation, space and privacy that safeguard their FDWs' safety and modesty. FDWs and employers are informed of these guidelines at the Settling-In Programme and Employer Orientation Programme respectively.As each household would have its own unique and varied needs for domestic work, it is not practical to stipulate fixed hours of rest and work for FDWs. For instance, a household with very young children or frail seniors may require greater attention from the FDW at different times of the day, while a household with teens and older adults may not. We encourage employers and FDWs to maintain open communication and work out arrangements that are agreeable to both parties.  \"},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mrs Josephine Teo: Since the launch of Adapt and Grow (A&G) initiative in 2016, more than 2,000 companies have partnered with Workforce Singapore to place more than 10,000 individuals through the Professional Conversion Programmes (PCPs). These PCPs provide training and salary support to employers who hire and reskill mid-career jobseekers for new PMET jobs. Currently, there are over 100 PCPs in about 30 sectors. We will continue to expand or develop new PCPs in growth sectors.Although some tasks within jobs can be performed by automation, few jobs can be fully automated by technology, in particular those that require flexibility, creativity and social interaction. While technology may reduce manpower reliance in some areas, technology can also create jobs of better quality.Where possible, it is better to intervene upstream before workers are retrenched. Workforce Singapore (WSG), together with the economic agencies, engages companies on their reorganisation plans and manpower needs to help them reskill and redeploy employees whose jobs are at risk, so that these employees can take on new job roles. Last year, about 1,300 at-risk workers were retrained for new job roles through re-deployment PCPs. WSG will make a bigger push in sectors that are restructuring.

This includes maintaining the cleanliness of the vehicle, as well as the receptacle and equipment used for the transportation of food, and storing food at the correct temperature. Failure to do so would constitute an offence under the Sale of Food Act and the Environmental Public Health Act.To ensure food safety, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) has been engaging food delivery companies on the need to adopt good practices in food hygiene and safety.

       "  'answer': \"Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): The United States (US) Treasury produces a semiannual report on the macroeconomic policies of the major trading partners of the United States. In its report published in May, the US Treasury included Singapore in a Monitoring List of trading partners that it deemed merited closer attention on their currency practices and macroeconomic policies.The US Treasury uses a generic set of criteria to determine the countries on its Monitoring List. The criteria include whether a country has a significant bilateral goods trade surplus with the US; a material overall current account surplus; or has in practice engaged in persistent one-sided interventions in the foreign exchange market. Singapore was assessed to have met the second and third criteria, and was therefore included in the Monitoring List.Singapore's inclusion in the Monitoring List does not affect the Monetary Authority of Singapore's (MAS) conduct of monetary policy. The countries in the List are not by that virtue deemed to be currency manipulators. The US Treasury has also acknowledged the uniqueness of Singapore's exchange-rate based monetary policy system. Its report points out that MAS manages the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER) within a policy band, just as other central banks conduct monetary policy by targeting interest rates. And similar to other central banks that target the interest rate, MAS manages the exchange rate to ensure low inflation. MAS has made it clear that it does not use the exchange rate to make Singapore's exports more competitive.MAS continues to be in constructive dialogue with the US Treasury to ensure that Singapore’s monetary policy framework including the role of foreign exchange intervention operations, are well-understood.

       "  'answer': 'Mr S Iswaran: In cyberspace, our defences are only as strong as our weakest link. Cybersecurity is hence a collective responsibility shared by the Government, private sector, individuals and the community.To enable this, the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) has conducted various targeted engagement and outreach efforts to members of the public, enterprises and students, to promote cybersecurity awareness and the adoption of good cybersecurity practices.Every year, CSA runs nationwide cybersecurity awareness campaigns to highlight the importance of cybersecurity, and provide cyber hygiene tips. These include conducting roadshows in the heartlands, and talks in schools and community centres. The 2018 cybersecurity awareness campaign, called \"Cyber Tips 4 You\", promoted four cyber hygiene practices: (1) use a strong password and two-factor authentication; (2) use antivirus software; (3) update software as soon as possible; and (4) watch out for signs of phishing.In addition, a Cyber Savvy vending machine has been making its rounds at the public libraries since November 2018. Library-goers can learn about good cybersecurity practices and win a small gift by attempting a quiz. More than 60,000 quiz attempts have been recorded so far. CSA will deploy more machines for outreach in community, commercial and school settings.The Singapore Computer Emergency Response Team (SingCERT) also issues advisories to alert the public and enterprises on cyber threats, and provides advice on remediation and preventive measures. Members of the public and enterprises can sign-up for advisories at www.csa.gov.sg/singcert.   Specific to enterprises, CSA has developed publicly available cybersecurity resources, such as the Be Safe Online Handbook, which outlines steps that enterprises should take to strengthen their cyber defences and enhance digital risk management.School-going youth are also an important target group, to establish good cyber hygiene practices from an early age. For example, CSA has collaborated with the Personal Data Protection Commission to produce a series of Cyber Safety activity books, which has benefited four cohorts of Primary 5 students, with more than 200,000 copies distributed. Also, with the support of the Ministry of Education, CSA has developed a Cybersecurity Awareness Skit, which is expected to reach about 24,000 students at close to 40 secondary schools.Even as the Government continues to do more to create a safer cyberspace, organisations and individuals must take responsibility for their own cybersecurity.

       "  'answer': \"Mr Ong Ye Kung: Examinations continue to be important as it inculcates hard work and discipline amongst our students. However, it cannot be over-emphasised to the extent that it undermines the holistic development of children, and douses their curiosity to learn. This is why MOE undertook significant efforts to change the scoring system of PSLE, reduce school-based assessment load and modify the format of the school report card to move away from an over-emphasis on academic results. By 2021, schools will be removing the mid-year examinations at Primary 3, Primary 5, Secondary 1 and Secondary 3. This reduces assessment load at those levels by 25% and provides more time and space for engaged learning to take place.Starting from this year, we have also removed all tests and examinations for Primary 1 and Primary 2, and require schools to conduct no more than one test per subject per school term for Primary 3 to Secondary 5. School report cards will no longer indicate class and level positions to reduce over-emphasis on peer comparison.Some schools have decided to implement these changes earlier than scheduled. By 2020, more than half of our Primary schools would have removed Primary 3 and Primary 5 mid-year examinations, and more than 90% of Secondary schools would be removing their Secondary 3 mid-year examinations, one year ahead of schedule.It is too early to conclude on their impact. The feedback we received is that educators and parents see the value of such adjustments, and support the direction of the move.These changes to school-based assessment load complement a broader set of efforts to develop our students more holistically. Character and Citizenship Education continues to be a big part of a student's school life. Co-Curricular Activities remain integral to the school programme. In addition, the Applied Learning Programme and Learning for Life Programme in schools enable our students to apply learning in real-world settings, and develop stronger life skills and socio-emotional competencies. Values in Action programme and outdoor adventure camps are also important platforms for character development and nurturing of 21st century competences.Add together, these programmes ensure that a large part of the curriculum is devoted to authentic learning opportunities to discover new interests and develop character in our students.\"},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Between January and May 2019, the National Environment Agency (NEA) conducted more than 372,000 inspections which uncovered about 6,500 instances of mosquito breeding. About 900 enforcement actions were taken against households, including three repeat offenders. Another 950 enforcement actions were taken against other premises, which include construction sites and commercial premises. The total number of enforcement actions taken for mosquito breeding has generally increased between 2016 and 2018. To safeguard public health, NEA will not hesitate to take enforcement action against anyone found to be breeding mosquitoes. NEA last reviewed the penalty regime in 2016 to impose a fine on all households detected with mosquito breeding, and not just those found with breeding within active dengue clusters. Under the Control of Vectors and Pesticides Act, owners whose premises are found with mosquito breeding may be fined up to $5,000 or imprisoned for a term not exceeding three months or both, with heavier penalties for subsequent convictions. NEA will monitor the enhanced regime to ensure that the penalties for mosquito breeding are appropriate and have sufficient deterrent effect.'},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mr Desmond Lee: We recognise that youths-at-risk often face multiple stressors, including weak family support, negative peer influence and financial difficulty.Since 2018, MSF has appointed nine Social Service Agencies to run a suite of programmes aimed at addressing different at-risk behaviours. For example, a core programme is the Enhanced STEP-UP, which helps youths who are either at risk of dropping out or have stopped attending school, to continue their education or acquire work skills and employment. It provides individual casework and counselling to address specific risks and needs of our youths. Recognising that youths-at-risk do not naturally seek centre-based help, MSF has appointed two Social Service Agencies since 2012 to run the Youth GO! Programme. Youth workers do street outreach and build a social relationship with the youths before moving on to case management or deeper engagement through interest-based activities. The interest-based activities engage the youths constructively and provide an alternative to youths’ negative activities.MOE has also established the Uplifting Pupils in Life and Inspiring Families Taskforce (UPLIFT) to strengthen upstream support for students from disadvantaged families, such as by enhancing after-school engagement programmes. The programmes seek to improve the students' connectedness to school, community and peers, and strengthen their motivation and resilience.  It is not uncommon that at-risk youths are in families that face multiple challenges. Family Service Centres work with such families to address a range of issues, to ensure that both the youths and their family members receive support that is timely and effective.As announced at MSF's Committee of Supply debate earlier this year, MSF is piloting a Localised Community Network (LCN) in Jurong West. The pilot will enable relevant Government agencies to pull together data and identify at-risk youths early, and coordinate agencies and partners in the local community to more seamlessly serve the youths and their families.MSF will continue to partner other Ministries and Social Service Agencies to provide convenient, comprehensive and coordinated social services, so that all youths have the opportunity to develop to their full potential.\"},\n",

       "  'question': 'Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry asked the Minister for Manpower whether the CPF Board can share with the public how the monthly CPF payouts from CPF Life or the Retirement Sum Scheme are calculated as well as the assumptions in determining the payouts, through publication of guidelines and online calculators.',\n",
       "  'answer': \"Mrs Josephine Teo: CPF members receive monthly retirement payouts through CPF LIFE or the Retirement Sum Scheme (RSS). Members born in or after 1958 will automatically be included in CPF LIFE if they have at least $60,000 in their Retirement Account (RA) when they turn 65. All other members1 will continue to be on the RSS, unless they voluntarily opt to join CPF LIFE.  RSS payouts are designed to last up to 20 years taking into account the base interest rate on RA savings, which is now 4%. The CPF Extra Interest (EI) and Additional Extra Interest (AEI) provided by the Government are used to extend the RSS payout duration beyond 20 years. In this way, members enjoy payouts for a longer duration and there is less risk that their savings will run out. The period of extension depends on the member's base payout amount, but does not go beyond 10 years.   Unlike the RSS, CPF LIFE is designed to provide lifelong payouts. The payout depends principally on how much a member puts into CPF LIFE. An independent actuarial consultant appointed by the CPF Board determines the payouts taking into account factors such as mortality rates and interest earned on the amounts committed to CPF LIFE. Payouts are reviewed annually to account for changes in these factors. For example, if more people live longer than expected, the monthly payouts may decrease and vice versa. Any adjustment is expected to be small and gradual, and affected members are informed ahead of the adjustment. Members who wish to estimate their payouts can use the CPF LIFE estimator on the CPF website. They may also visit any of the five service centres to find out more.\"},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mrs Josephine Teo: The breakdown of median gross monthly income of full-time employed residents by sex, age and marital status is provided in Table 1. Married males earned more than single males across all age groups, whereas single females aged 30 and above earned more than married females of the same age group. Among singles of the same age group, women earned more than men; while among those married of the same age group, men earned more than women. Table 2 provides the breakdown of median gross monthly income of full-time employed female residents by age and the number of children given birth to. We do not collect such data for males. Among women aged 30 and above with children, those with two children tended to earn more than those with just one child or three or more children in the same age group. It is not straightforward to compare to those with no children as they include both single and married women. Data alone cannot establish the causal impact on income of marital status and number of children; as these factors can themselves be influenced by income and education levels. There are also generational differences, for example, in age of marriage, rates of divorce, and the division of caregiving and household responsibilities between married couples.

       "  'answer': \"Mr S Iswaran: On 8 May 2019, the Police and the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) were informed of a ransomware incident on the Singapore Red Cross's (SRC) blood donor database. The database contained the details of about 4,300 donors who booked appointments to donate blood via SRC's webpage, including their name, contact number and email address.According to SRC, its investigations have found that the perpetrator exploited a weak administrator password that left the webpage vulnerable to unauthorised access. Nevertheless, investigations by the Police and the PDPC are ongoing.Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs) such as SRC are non-governmental organisations (NGOs) that provide services that benefit the community, and hold data about donors, volunteers and beneficiaries. It is therefore important that NGOs put in place the necessary data protection and cybersecurity safeguards to maintain the confidentiality of such data.While NGOs do not need to comply with Government IT security guidelines, there are national-level and sector-level frameworks and resources to assist them in enhancing the protection of their systems and data.At the national-level, all private sector organisations, including NGOs, are subject to requirements under the Personal Data Protection Act. The PDPC also provides such organisations with guidelines and guides on how to comply with their data protection obligations. Examples include the guides issued by the PDPC and the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) to assist organisations in securing personal data on electronic medium and managing data breaches.To help organisations including NGOs improve their cybersecurity posture, CSA enhances cybersecurity awareness and promotes good cybersecurity practices through channels such as the GoSafeOnline portal (www.csa.gov.sg/gosafeonline) and the Singapore Computer Emergency Response Team's (SingCERT's) portal (www.csa.gov.sg/singcert).At the VWO sector-level, agencies such as the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) and the Office of the Commissioner of the Charities (COC) play an important role in building up capabilities among VWOs, to protect confidential data and mitigate cybersecurity risks. For example, some VWOs that administer programmes that are funded by MSF use an integrated case management system that protects clients’ data in accordance to Government IT security policies; while COC is working with potential partners to provide subsidised IT security audit services for charities, including VWOs.The Government is committed to help NGOs such as VWOs establish resilient IT security frameworks to safeguard confidential data. NGOs and their senior leadership must also play their part to ensure that the risks in relation to data protection and cybersecurity are adequately addressed. This is necessary so that they can continue to uphold the high level of trust and confidence that their stakeholders have placed in them.\"},\n",

In a survey conducted in 2016, 9 in 10 households indicated that they have benefited from the programme, and 7 in 10 stated that they were excited to try out new technology and were confident in using the internet. Another round of survey is being conducted this year.The NEU PC Plus Programme provides a subsidised PC with three years of free broadband to the bottom 20% of households with school-going children or with persons with disabilities. More than 40,000 low-income households have benefited from the programme since November 2006, contributing to 98%2 of resident households with school-going children having computer access at home. 9 in 10 households indicated in a 2018 survey that the programme has benefited them. 7 in 10 primary school students and 8 in 10 secondary school students also shared that the programme has aided their learning process and helped them to complete their school work independently.Beyond the provision of broadband access and PCs, there is also a need to equip individuals with digital literacy skills.

       "  'answer': \"Mr Gan Kim Yong: There are currently 149 Medifund-approved institutions (MFI), spanning all healthcare settings including public acute and community hospitals, specialist outpatient clinics, polyclinics, and Government-subsidised nursing homes. Over each of the last three years, close to half of subsidised patients received services at more than one MFI, most of whom visited two MFIs each year. 1% of subsidised patients received MediFund assistance at more than one MFI, most of whom received assistance at two MFIs each year. Each MFI has an independent MediFund Committee, made up of representatives such as community leaders and professionals, to assess MediFund applications. They are typically supported by Medical Social Worker (MSWs) and other staff who help assess a patient's circumstances. Apart from assessing MediFund applications, MSWs also serve a wider group of patients and caregivers, such as extending social and emotional support and making referrals to other social services or assistance schemes. For this reason, MFIs are unable to determine specifically the cost of processing MediFund applications alone.   We periodically review MediFund processes to improve and streamline them where possible. For instance, needy patients on Public Assistance today do not need to undergo further MediFund assessment at MFIs. We are also in the midst of rolling out system enhancements, led by our MSWs, that will streamline the application process and improve information sharing.

In 2018, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) stepped up inspections on commercial diving activities at Anchorage Waters, with the support of the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA). The inspections focused on ensuring that diving companies have competent divers, proper risk assessment and planning prior to diving operations. Through these inspections, we have taken enforcement actions against 10 companies for safety lapses.The Workplace Safety and Health Council (WSHC) is working with the diving community to update the commercial diving training curriculum and the Diving Technical Advisory for Inland/Inshore Commercial Diving Safety and Health.

       "  'question': 'Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Manpower what are the existing efforts in reaching out to younger freelancers and self-employed persons who are below the age of 35 to create awareness about opportunities for career progression.',\n",
       "  'answer': \"Mrs Josephine Teo: Over the past decade, the share of those who did self-employed work as their main job, that is, primary self-employed persons (SEPs)1, remained stable at 8% to 10% of our resident workforce. In 2018, 17% of primary SEPs were aged below 35. In comparison, 31% of regular employees were aged below 35. Youths below 35 are therefore not over-represented among the self-employed. Young Singaporeans have opportunities to learn about various occupations starting from school. In particular, the Institute of Technical Education (ITE), Polytechnics and Universities provide education and career guidance (ECG) to help students make better-informed choices as they transit into the workforce. These efforts include learning journeys to companies, workshops with industry representatives, and career fairs. Also, with the support of ITE and Polytechnics, Workforce Singapore piloted its Career Starter Programme early this year for graduating students. Complementing these efforts are the MySkillsFuture Portal and the MyCareersFuture Portal. The MySkillsFuture Portal is a key resource for all workers, including SEPs, to easily access information on industries and occupations, as well as tools to support their training and career development. The MyCareersFuture Portal enables SEPs who seek career progression via regular employment to locate suitable jobs more easily.The Ministry of Manpower is also working with our tripartite partners and other Government agencies to raise awareness about skills training for SEPs. For example, since 2016, the National Trades Union Congress' Freelancers and Self-Employed Unit (U FSE) has hosted annual Freelancers Fairs. Besides providing useful information, such fairs highlight opportunities for skills training for SEPs. Sector agencies also provide training support to SEPs. For example, insurance agents can tap on industry competency standards and training subsidies under the Institute of Banking and Finance to acquire expertise in financial planning and future-enabled skills. Media freelancers and professionals may refer to the Skills Framework for Media, which is a useful guide on job roles, skills required and possible career pathways. The Infocomm Media and Development Authority (IMDA) also provides funding support to SEPs, in particular media freelancers, to encourage them to acquire deeper skills and competencies through a list of pre-approved courses. In addition, in occupations, such as insurance and real estate agents, SEPs are required to go for regular training and assessment to maintain their professional qualifications. The Ministry encourages individuals, including young persons, to tap on these efforts and initiatives to find out more about the prospects for career development in their desired occupations.\"},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mr Ong Ye Kung: In general, international students receive less funding than local students, and most of MOE’s spending goes to supporting the education of Singapore Citizens. Government-funded financial assistance at our schools and government-funded bursaries at our post-secondary education institutions are for Singapore Citizens only.The Government does give out a small number of scholarships for international students in our schools and Autonomous Universities. The total Government spending for this group of international students comes up to around $130 million a year, which is one percent of MOE's annual budget of $13 billion. For those international students on scholarships, their academic performance is closely monitored every semester, and the scholarship would be withdrawn if the scholar’s performance is not satisfactory. Additionally, international students on scholarships at the Autonomous Universities are also obliged to work in a Singapore entity for up to six years after graduation. Some of these international students eventually apply for and are granted Permanent Residency, and some may also take up citizenship.Every education system in the world will provide some support to international students, and Singaporeans are also benefiting from foreign sponsorships for their studies.

From our preliminary findings, three main factors have contributed to the narrowing of pay differences. First, the employment rate of women in prime-working ages has risen; they tend to be better educated and earned higher wages than older women. Second, women have moved out of lower-skilled industries more quickly than men. Third, greater access to flexible work arrangements has enabled more women to continue working and maintain their career advancement. More findings will be shared towards the end of 2019.'},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mrs Josephine Teo: The amount of unpaid salaries ordered to foreign claimants by the Employment Claims Tribunals (ECT) since its establishment on 1 April 2017 is shown in the table below. Taking into account that the 2017 figure is not based on the full year, the value of unpaid salaries ordered to foreign claimants by the ECT has not increased in 2018.Overall, the amount of money recovered to foreign claimants is about half of the total ordered amount. In terms of individual outcomes, about 40% of the claimants reported that they received full payment from employers. About 40% reported partial payment, which includes all payments made by employers, insurers or the Migrant Workers Assistance Fund. The average amount owed to foreign claimants who fully recovered salaries from their employers is about $3,500, significantly lower compared to that of claimants who received partial or no payment, about $7,100. The vast majority of cases of partial or no payment involve employers who are in financial difficulty.

       "  'answer': 'Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) takes a serious view of food safety. SFA will take enforcement action against operators who fail to adhere to food hygiene and safety regulations, and for any food hygiene lapses found.SFA conducts regular inspections on a risk-based approach. From January 2018 to March 2019, more than 95,000 inspections of food operators were conducted to ensure compliance with food hygiene and safety. In particular, more than 3,700 checks were conducted on food caterers - a category of food business that poses higher food safety risks. The Government is paying close attention to the mass gastroenteritis incidents reported between November 2018 and March 2019. Joint investigations by the Ministry of Health and SFA thus far found that poor food handling practices, the lack of environmental cleanliness both in the food preparation and common areas, and poor personal hygiene practices were the main causes of these outbreaks. Gastroenteritis can be caused by eating contaminated food, or coming in contact with an infected person or an environment contaminated by viral gastroenteritis. On poor food handling practices, SFA has taken enforcement actions for the lapses found and required operators to rectify the lapses. SFA has stepped up surveillance and engagement of all food operators, particularly for food caterers supplying food to pre-schools, and during festive seasons. Advisories are issued periodically to remind food operators to ensure that their food handlers observe good food hygiene and safety practices, and that their Food Hygiene Officers (FHOs) fulfil their duties to ensure good food hygiene and safety practices, and adherence to time-stamping requirements.  Food handlers and FHOs working at premises that have been suspended due to food hygiene and safety lapses are required to undergo re-training and be re-certified for Basic Food Hygiene Course (BFHC) and WSQ \"Conduct Food & Beverage Hygiene Audit\" programme respectively. SFA will continue to work with the industry to build a strong food safety culture among food business operators through strengthening their food safety management systems as well as competencies of food handlers and FHOs.At the same time, SFA is taking steps to strengthen the regulatory regime for food hygiene and safety. For a start, heavier penalties will be imposed on food operators involved in significant food poisoning incidents. Total composition amounts will be increased and food operators who commit serious food hygiene and safety offences will be prosecuted in Court. In appropriate cases, SFA will also press for deterrent sentences to be imposed by the Court.A multi-pronged approach to incorporate good food hygiene and safety practices as well as good environmental and personal hygiene to prevent and control infection is important to mitigate gastroenteritis. In the recent spate of outbreaks in pre-schools, SFA and the Early Childhood Development Agency issued an advisory to emphasise the need to maintain environmental cleanliness and put in place infection control measures. This includes reinforcing good personal hygiene practices in every individual to prevent the spread of diseases and to protect oneself from acquiring infections. For instance, areas with vomitus must be properly cleaned with bleach to disinfect, and children and pre-school staff who are sick should stay at home so as not to spread infection. Fundamentally, food safety is a joint responsibility across the industry, consumers and the Government as food can be contaminated at any point along the food supply chain. While SFA continues to be vigilant and ensures that regulatory measures are in place and properly enforced, the industry and consumers must also play their part to upkeep high standards of food, environmental and personal hygiene at all times.'},\n",

We work closely with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to promote green financing in Singapore and to increase the financial sector’s awareness of environmental risks and opportunities. The Government has taken a pragmatic approach through the adoption of international standards, market-led best practices and capability-building in the development of green financing in Singapore. There has been progress on various fronts. (i) In 2015, the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) issued the Guidelines on Responsible Financing. Our local banks have all adopted these guidelines to evaluate their borrowers’ Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) risks and help borrowers improve their sustainability profiles. Most recently, in April 2019, the local banks announced their decision to cease the financing of new coal-fired power plants.(ii) The Singapore Exchange (SGX) introduced the \"Comply or Explain\" Sustainability Reporting Guide for listed companies, beginning from the financial year ending on or after 31 December 2017. The inaugural sustainability reports by first-time reporting companies have progressively been published. (iii) To encourage the issuance of green bonds, MAS introduced a Green Bond Grant Scheme in 2017, which helps to defray the cost of certifying sustainability oriented bonds as green bonds. This Scheme leverages international green bond standards to promote convergence and harmonisation with regional and international markets. Over $4 billion of green bonds have been issued to date. The Government also supports capability-building initiatives as they are key to companies understanding and incorporating ESG risks and opportunities across their core businesses.

       "  'answer': 'Mrs Josephine Teo: Wages have grown at all levels in recent years. In the past 5 years, real wages at the 20th percentile grew 4.2% per annum, more than at the median. As a result, the proportion of full-time employed Singapore Residents earning less than $1,300 in gross monthly income from work1 (including employer CPF contributions) has fallen to about 5%; the number of such residents has also declined by about 40% to 97,000. About 15% earned less than $2,000; the numbers declined by about 30% over five years to 282,000.

For example, the take-up rate of vaccination against second booster doses of diphtheria as well as the vaccination against polio, both offered in schools at Primary 5, are above 90% each. For the recently rolled out Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccination, the opt-in rate has been slightly over 90% for the first 25 schools covered so far. In addition, measles vaccination coverage among resident children is at 93% for the second dose at 7 years of age.We want to encourage high vaccination take-up rates to achieve herd immunity, so as to protect against the outbreak of potentially serious diseases such as measles, diphtheria and polio.

       "  'answer': 'Mrs Josephine Teo: The amount of unpaid salaries ordered to foreign claimants by the Employment Claims Tribunals (ECT) since its establishment on 1 April 2017 is shown in the table below. Taking into account that the 2017 figure is not based on the full year, the value of unpaid salaries ordered to foreign claimants by the ECT has not increased in 2018.Overall, the amount of money recovered to foreign claimants is about half of the total ordered amount. In terms of individual outcomes, about 40% of the claimants reported that they received full payment from employers. About 40% reported partial payment, which includes all payments made by employers, insurers or the Migrant Workers Assistance Fund. The average amount owed to foreign claimants who fully recovered salaries from their employers is about $3,500, significantly lower compared to that of claimants who received partial or no payment, about $7,100. The vast majority of cases of partial or no payment involve employers who are in financial difficulty. The evidence is thus very clear, that early reporting of arrears is critical to the prospects of full recovery. This is why MOM consistently educates workers to approach the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management early when they encounter arrears, and urges Non-Governmental Organisations that assist foreign workers to do the same.'},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) takes a serious view of food safety. SFA will take enforcement action against operators who fail to adhere to food hygiene and safety regulations, and for any food hygiene lapses found.SFA conducts regular inspections on a risk-based approach. From January 2018 to March 2019, more than 95,000 inspections of food operators were conducted to ensure compliance with food hygiene and safety. In particular, more than 3,700 checks were conducted on food caterers - a category of food business that poses higher food safety risks. The Government is paying close attention to the mass gastroenteritis incidents reported between November 2018 and March 2019. Joint investigations by the Ministry of Health and SFA thus far found that poor food handling practices, the lack of environmental cleanliness both in the food preparation and common areas, and poor personal hygiene practices were the main causes of these outbreaks. Gastroenteritis can be caused by eating contaminated food, or coming in contact with an infected person or an environment contaminated by viral gastroenteritis. On poor food handling practices, SFA has taken enforcement actions for the lapses found and required operators to rectify the lapses. SFA has stepped up surveillance and engagement of all food operators, particularly for food caterers supplying food to pre-schools, and during festive seasons. Advisories are issued periodically to remind food operators to ensure that their food handlers observe good food hygiene and safety practices, and that their Food Hygiene Officers (FHOs) fulfil their duties to ensure good food hygiene and safety practices, and adherence to time-stamping requirements.  Food handlers and FHOs working at premises that have been suspended due to food hygiene and safety lapses are required to undergo re-training and be re-certified for Basic Food Hygiene Course (BFHC) and WSQ \"Conduct Food & Beverage Hygiene Audit\" programme respectively. SFA will continue to work with the industry to build a strong food safety culture among food business operators through strengthening their food safety management systems as well as competencies of food handlers and FHOs.At the same time, SFA is taking steps to strengthen the regulatory regime for food hygiene and safety. For a start, heavier penalties will be imposed on food operators involved in significant food poisoning incidents. Total composition amounts will be increased and food operators who commit serious food hygiene and safety offences will be prosecuted in Court. In appropriate cases, SFA will also press for deterrent sentences to be imposed by the Court.A multi-pronged approach to incorporate good food hygiene and safety practices as well as good environmental and personal hygiene to prevent and control infection is important to mitigate gastroenteritis. In the recent spate of outbreaks in pre-schools, SFA and the Early Childhood Development Agency issued an advisory to emphasise the need to maintain environmental cleanliness and put in place infection control measures. This includes reinforcing good personal hygiene practices in every individual to prevent the spread of diseases and to protect oneself from acquiring infections. For instance, areas with vomitus must be properly cleaned with bleach to disinfect, and children and pre-school staff who are sick should stay at home so as not to spread infection. Fundamentally, food safety is a joint responsibility across the industry, consumers and the Government as food can be contaminated at any point along the food supply chain. While SFA continues to be vigilant and ensures that regulatory measures are in place and properly enforced, the industry and consumers must also play their part to upkeep high standards of food, environmental and personal hygiene at all times.'},\n",

We work closely with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to promote green financing in Singapore and to increase the financial sector’s awareness of environmental risks and opportunities. The Government has taken a pragmatic approach through the adoption of international standards, market-led best practices and capability-building in the development of green financing in Singapore. There has been progress on various fronts. (i) In 2015, the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) issued the Guidelines on Responsible Financing. Our local banks have all adopted these guidelines to evaluate their borrowers’ Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) risks and help borrowers improve their sustainability profiles. Most recently, in April 2019, the local banks announced their decision to cease the financing of new coal-fired power plants.(ii) The Singapore Exchange (SGX) introduced the \"Comply or Explain\" Sustainability Reporting Guide for listed companies, beginning from the financial year ending on or after 31 December 2017. The inaugural sustainability reports by first-time reporting companies have progressively been published. (iii) To encourage the issuance of green bonds, MAS introduced a Green Bond Grant Scheme in 2017, which helps to defray the cost of certifying sustainability oriented bonds as green bonds. This Scheme leverages international green bond standards to promote convergence and harmonisation with regional and international markets. Over $4 billion of green bonds have been issued to date. The Government also supports capability-building initiatives as they are key to companies understanding and incorporating ESG risks and opportunities across their core businesses. For example, MAS is working with insurers to anchor ESG research, modelling capabilities and underwriting teams in Singapore to catalyse the development of innovative ESG products.These are encouraging developments.

       "  'answer': 'Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Ensuring the safety of rail operations is our top priority. The recent train collision on the Tsuen Wan line in Hong Kong is a reminder that we must always be vigilant every step of the way, from robust system design, to rigorous testing and commissioning, and responsible operations and maintenance. The Thales SelTrac Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC) signalling system is an established product and has been adapted for use on 86 metros across 40 different countries. Hong Kong’s Tsuen Wan line and Singapore’s North-South and East-West Lines (NSEWL) also use the system. Each system is however custom-built to the metro’s unique architecture and specifications, with software logic tailored for the local needs and conditions. The Hong Kong authorities are investigating the 18 March 2019 train collision. This may take a few months. We will study the investigation report when it is available. There were media articles linking the incident to a dual backup system which was uniquely designed for the Tsuen Wan line’s signalling system. None of our MRT or LRT lines use such a system. Regardless, we should avoid unnecessary speculation into the root causes of the incident until the formal investigation report is available. The Joo Koon incident in late 2017 was due to complications from concurrently operating the NSEWL’s legacy and new CBTC signalling systems on the same line. We understand that this was not the case for the collision on the Tsuen Wan line in Hong Kong. The NSEWL now operates entirely on the CBTC signalling system, so a similar incident to Joo Koon will not recur.Arising from the Joo Koon incident, LTA invited Thales to set up a CBTC simulation laboratory in Singapore – the first of its kind in Asia, and the largest by Thales in the world. This has allowed LTA and SMRT to perform additional tests to fine-tune the CBTC signalling system’s software and hardware before it is implemented on our rail lines. It has also contributed to the NSEWL’s vast improvement in rail reliability.'},\n",

When setting the speed limit of roads, LTA generally considers factors such as road geometry and the level of pedestrian activities. Locations with higher pedestrian activities (e.g. School Zones and Silver Zones) have reduced speed limits of 40 km/hour. Rather than road speed limits, we seek to develop off-road infrastructure to create a conducive environment for all active mobility users. To enhance active mobility infrastructure, LTA will roll out more dedicated cycling paths and build a cycling network in every HDB town by 2030. This means a total of 700 km of cycling paths across the island. Apart from infrastructure, user behaviour is critical for ensuring safety.

The GBA aims to become a vibrant world-class city cluster and global innovation hub that will lead China’s further reforms and opening up. This will create new opportunities that are beneficial to regional economies. Given our strong ties with GBA cities and businesses, Singapore is well-placed to tap on potential business opportunities in the GBA.Singapore agencies and counterparts at the Guangdong Provincial People’s Government know one another well. Singapore holds regular ministerial meetings with Guangdong through the Singapore-Guangdong Collaboration Council (SGCC). In November 2018, the China-Singapore Guangzhou Knowledge City (CSGKC) was also elevated as a State-Level Bilateral Cooperation project to promote cooperation in areas such as technology innovation, intellectual property rights, and advanced manufacturing. The GBA outline development plan highlights the CSGKC as a key technology innovation platform. As part of our engagement with the GBA, Singapore will also twin with Shenzhen under the ASEAN Smart Cities Network. Hong Kong is another GBA city which Singapore is well-connected to. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) meet regularly to discuss financial regulatory issues. MAS and HKMA have signed agreements to cooperate including a FinTech Cooperation Agreement and a Memorandum of Understanding to facilitate digital trade and trade financing between our two markets.  There is strong mutual desire between Singapore and GBA authorities to nurture and grow a vibrant digital economy. The various platforms that have been established allow for active exchange of ideas and collaboration between government, companies, universities and research institutes. This will lead to opportunities for Singapore’s ICT, financial and other companies in the GBA in the areas of technology innovation, infrastructure development, data management, and digitalisation. We will also continue to build on our competitiveness as a financial hub. Singapore has deep strengths across a range of financial activities, including asset management, foreign exchange and derivatives, insurance and reinsurance. We are a major US dollar funding market and our capital markets serve not just Southeast Asia, but the pan-Asian region. Singapore is also a leading centre for FinTech.  At the same time, the Singapore Government continues to invest heavily to help our businesses and people remain competitive and translate opportunities into tangible gains. We do so by continually strengthening our value propositions by acquiring deep skills, improving our productivity, and encouraging innovation. For example, the Digital Economy Framework for Action introduced last year covers programmes such as the SMEs Go Digital Programme, which supports SMEs in their digitalisation efforts to improve their productivity. The TechSkills Accelerator (TeSA) programme, on the other hand, equips ICT professionals to take on deeper tech roles, and for non-ICT workers to switch to a tech career. These moves will ensure that Singapore has a good chance of sustaining our competitiveness and remaining relevant in the global economy. The Government is also committed to work in tandem with leading global and local ICT and tech companies, to encourage industry investments that complement government efforts in building a thriving ecosystem of digital opportunities for all.'},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mr Gan Kim Yong: On 28 March 2019, the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) recalled three brands of medicines which belong to the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) class of blood pressure medication and contain the ingredient losartan. All three medicines were manufactured by Hetero Labs Limited. Following the recall of several losartan medicines in US due to the presence of a nitrosamine impurity, N-nitroso-N-methyl-4-aminobutyric acid (NMBA), HSA tested the suspected losartan medicines and they were found to contain trace amounts of NMBA which are above the acceptable limit1.  Under HSA's drug regulatory regime, stringent standards are set on the quality and safety of medicines sold in Singapore. Before being approved for sale, the medicines are evaluated to ensure that they meet the required international standards of quality, safety and efficacy. After approval, HSA conducts post-market surveillance, which includes monitoring of global developments and risk-based product sampling and testing for compliance to quality and safety specifications. Products found to be deficient in quality will be withdrawn from the market. Manufacturers are also required to test all batches of medicines, including the levels of specific impurities, to ensure that they comply with stipulated standards.  The routine tests required of the manufacturers are based on known impurities that may be generated during the manufacturing process, as it is not practical to exhaustively test for all types of impurities. In the case of the recalled losartan medicines, testing for nitrosamines like NMBA was not previously part of the testing parameters of ARB medicines as NMBA was not expected to be generated in the manufacturing process. This approach is similar to that adopted in other countries including the US, Canada and the European Union.  HSA now requires companies supplying ARBs to ensure that future batches of their medicines are tested and do not have unacceptable levels of nitrosamine impurities before supply to Singapore. HSA has also been working with suppliers and international regulatory agencies to verify the cause of contamination and to formulate measures to eliminate the nitrosamines in the medium to longer term.

While these general consumer goods are not required to be pre-approved before they are sold in the market, ESG monitors safety issues in such goods via consumer feedback and overseas consumer product notices and will work with suppliers to address any safety concerns quickly. Based on the information it gathers, ESG conducts tests on selected consumer products in the market to ensure that they are safe. Suppliers found with non compliant products will be asked to rectify or stop sale. This risk-based approach towards product safety regulation allows general consumer products, which have lower safety risks, to enter the market quickly without the need for comprehensive but resource intensive testing. This approach balances safeguarding consumers safety and ensuring market efficiency. ESG is aware that Fisher-Price has issued a voluntary recall globally, including in Singapore, of its Rock ‘N Play Sleepers and has issued an alert warning consumers to discontinue the use of the product. ESG has also published the alert on its website in April 2019. Consumers are strongly encouraged to respond to the product recall by Fisher-Price. Parents should exercise vigilance when buying and using products for their children, including observing the safety labels on products. Where a child’s entire weight is to be placed on a product, parents should check the product’s recommended maximum weight capacity to ensure it is suitable for their children. Baby rockers should only be used on the floor and not on elevated or soft surfaces as they may tipover and cause injury or suffocation. Parents should also supervise their children and secure them with restraints when they are in baby rockers.'},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Lawrence Wong: In 2018, 217 trees were uprooted and fell in public spaces. These incidents were due to strong winds and heavy rainfall. For the two million trees in urban areas under its care, NParks has a rigorous tree inspection regime in place which consists of regular inspections every 12 to 24 months, and additional annual in-depth inspections for larger trees. NParks also carries out measures such as replacing storm-vulnerable species with hardier trees, pruning trees regularly and prior to periods of more severe weather conditions, and using technology to analyse risk and improve inspection processes. NParks will continue to ensure that its tree management programme remains robust and comprehensive.There are another one million trees in public housing estates that are managed by the Town Councils (TCs). NParks is working with the TCs and HDB to set up a nation-wide tree registry system to better manage these trees. This system will comprehensively map out trees in public housing estates, and allow TCs to develop suitable tree care regimes and tree replacement programmes. NParks also provides technical training on tree health and maintenance for stakeholders who manage trees in Singapore, including TCs.'},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr S Iswaran: The number of complaints received by the Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA) and the telecommunication companies (telcos) concerning poor customer service by telecos has shown a decreasing trend over the past five years. IMDA requires telcos to look into every complaint and see how they can serve their customers better. IMDA also tracks consumer satisfaction of telecommunication services through the Consumer Awareness and Satisfaction Survey (CASS). The 2018 CASS showed that consumers were generally satisfied with their telcos, and consumer satisfaction has improved in several areas, including hotline waiting times, the time taken to resolve complaints, and the competence of customer service officers. An April 2019 poll of non-English speaking individuals conducted by IMDA also found that respondents were generally satisfied with the customer service by telcos. To address the needs of elderly customers, several telcos now allow customers to make appointments for telcos to call them back, so they do not have to wait on the line for too long. In addition, when receiving calls on their hotlines, the telcos will arrange for elderly customers to be served by officers who can speak the same language or dialect.'},\n",

While most of these diseases do not yet have an effective cure, early diagnosis and treatment for some of the diseases can substantially extend a patient’s lifespan and improve his quality of life.  To enable early diagnosis, our public healthcare institutions have implemented the National Expanded Newborn Screening Programme which covers more than 30 rare diseases. At our public healthcare institutions, patients with rare diseases can have access to subsidised inpatient and outpatient services. MediShield Life and MediSave can be utilised to pay for their hospital bills. Patients who need help with their bills may also apply for financial assistance such as MediFund and Medication Assistance Fund.A small number of individuals with very rare conditions require medications that are very costly. Our hospitals do their best to assist these patients, for example by negotiating price discounts with manufacturers for the medications where possible, waiving parts of their medical fees or drawing from hospital charity funds.

The fires mainly occurred at food establishments within residential areas such as coffee shops and hawker centres. The main cause was poor maintenance of the ducts, causing grease to accumulate and which ignited during cooking. The Fire Code, which is administered by SCDF under the Fire Safety Act, as well as the Singapore Food Agency’s (SFA) Environmental Public Health (Food Hygiene) Regulations, requires KEDs to be maintained regularly.

For example, the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) works with LTC providers and recruitment partners like Workforce Singapore (WSG) and Employment and Employability Institute (e2i) to facilitate local employment and raise awareness of job opportunities in the LTC sector. In 2018, more than 1,000 locals have joined the LTC sector through various recruitment efforts. MOH and AIC also support LTC providers in staff training and development. For example, training for newly hired local support care staff2 can be funded under the Community Care Traineeship Programme (CCTP) so they can be equipped with requisite skills to perform in their new roles.

       "  'answer': 'Mr Gan Kim Yong: MOH takes a serious view of any attempts to defraud the healthcare system at the expense of Singaporeans. Fraudulent behaviour, such as inappropriate patient referrals for financial gains and making false claims for services, is wrong and unethical. It also raises the overall costs of healthcare in Singapore, leading to Singaporeans paying more for their healthcare services and insurance plans. Various stakeholders have a part to play in combating healthcare insurance fraud. MOH monitors the landscape of MediShield Life and Integrated Shield Plan (IP) claims, and works with IP insurers to identify anomalous trends. For cases where criminal offences are suspected, MOH and insurers will refer them to the police for further investigation. The Singapore Medical Council (SMC) provides guidance to doctors through the Ethical Code and Ethical Guidelines (ECEG) on ethical practice and professional standards to ensure the wellbeing of patients. In particular, the ECEG prohibits doctors from letting business or financial considerations influence the objectivity of their clinical judgement in their management of patients. Doctors who contravene the ECEG can be subject to disciplinary action by SMC. Doctors, healthcare staff, patients, insurance providers, financial advisors and members of the public should lodge a complaint to MOH, SMC or the police if they suspect any fraudulent behaviour, or receive any suspicious propositions in relation to their healthcare services or health insurance claims.

Operators are required to complete the porting of mobile telephone numbers within one working day. Operators are also required to complete fixed-line number porting for consumers within five working days. A longer timeframe may apply in some instances. For example, where consumers are porting their fixed-line telephone number while also switching their fibre broadband provider, it would take at least an additional three working days for the incoming provider to activate fibre services before the number porting process can begin. If the number porting process takes longer than expected, the subscriber still receives services from the outgoing operator before the number is ported, and hence is charged fees under his or her contract. Subscribers who are aggrieved can nevertheless approach the relevant operator for recourse, including for an adjustment or waiver of the bill.

       "  'answer': '32 Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the number and percentage of current CPF members who are inactive, broken down by gender; (b) of the inactive members, in the last three years, what percentage does not have at least the CPF Basic Retirement Sum in their Retirement Accounts when they turned 55 years old, broken down by gender; and (c) what is the difference in CPF balances of inactive male and female members.Mrs Josephine Teo: The cohort Basic Retirement Sum (BRS) is adjusted every year to take into consideration inflation and rising standards of living for successive cohorts of seniors in retirement. Even so, the proportion of active CPF members turning age 55 who had set aside their cohort BRS has increased steadily as shown in Table 1. This reflects higher labour force participation rates and rising incomes of successive cohorts of members.The BRS attainment for both male and female CPF members have improved over the years and the difference in their savings have also narrowed. A study published by the CPF Board1 showed that the male-to-female average CPF balance ratio has reduced from 1.20 in 2006 to 1.13 in 2016. We expect this trend to continue.BRS attainment tends to mirror property wealth. It is highest among active CPF members who own a private property, and lowest for active CPF members who own 3-room or smaller HDB flats.It is difficult to draw meaningful conclusions by looking at CPF balances of members who are economically inactive and thus not required to make CPF contributions.

       "  'answer': \"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: According to media reports, since 7 March 2019, more than 3,000 Johoreans fell ill as a result of illegal dumping of chemical waste into Sungai Kim Kim, a river in Pasir Gudang. Hazardous fumes caused severe symptoms including nausea, shortness of breath and vomiting. Thousands needed immediate medical attention and many, including children, were admitted to hospitals for treatment. All 111 schools in the Pasir Gudang district were closed on 13 March 2019 for more than two weeks. Throughout this period, our agencies have been closely monitoring the situation and putting in place precautionary measures to guard against any potential pollution impacts arising from the illegal dumping of chemical waste at Sungai Kim Kim in Pasir Gudang. We have not detected any pollution impacts on Singapore's air and water quality or water supply.The National Environment Agency (NEA) continuously monitors the ambient concentration of a variety of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) at our air monitoring stations, including at four stations located in the north-eastern region of Singapore. These include benzene, toluene, and xylene, as well as other common VOCs from industrial emissions which are also closely monitored by other environmental agencies such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). NEA has not detected any elevated levels of VOCs. The 24-hour Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) has also been in the Good to Low-Moderate range, while the one-hour PM2.5 readings remained in the Normal range. The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) has also deployed its portable stand-off chemical gas detectors at the northeast region of Singapore to detect toxic chemicals, and has not detected any toxic chemicals in the air. For water quality, NEA's continuous buoy-based coastal water quality monitoring sensors deployed along the Straits of Johor have not detected any unusual variation in the key physical, chemical, and microbiological water quality parameters. NEA has also taken the additional step of collecting water samples at Pulau Ubin and its vicinity to test additional parameters, including compounds Malaysia has identified due to the chemical waste dumped in Sungai Kim Kim. These compounds have not been detected in our water samples. NEA has also not detected any anomalies in the quality of the waters at our recreational coastal beaches.The Public Utilities Board (PUB)'s online sensors have shown that the water quality of Johor River, our waterways and reservoirs in the north and north-eastern part of Singapore, as well as the water supply is within normal variations. On-site inspections and water quality checks have also shown no abnormalities. As a precautionary measure, PUB has installed oil booms at the outlet drains and estuaries along the north and north-eastern coast of Singapore. This incident has no impact on our water supply as the chemical dumping location is outside of our Johor River catchment area, where part of our water supply comes from. There have been no reports of unusual fish mortality at our local fish farms in the Straits of Johor. Singapore Food Agency (SFA)'s tests of seafood samples from these fish farms for compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), VOCs, and heavy metals have not detected any anomalies.We will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates if there are any significant developments. We will also continue to step up our checks and enforcement, to protect our environment and safeguard the health and safety of Singaporeans.\"},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mrs Josephine Teo: Based on the Ministry of Manpower (MOM)'s 2018 Comprehensive Labour Force Survey (CLFS), of the 543,500 female residents aged 25 and above who are not in the labour force, about two in three cited non-care-giving reasons, such as retirement, poor health/disability/old age and housework. About one in four cited care-giving to families (including childcare) or relatives as the main reasons they are out of the labour force. Those providing care-giving to families (excluding childcare) or relatives are generally older – 75% are aged 50 and above. Majority had work experience; the median length of time since they left their jobs was nine years. Vast majority of those who are providing childcare are aged between 30 and 49. Most had prior work experience; the median length of time they have not been working was five years. As survey respondents are different each year, the CLFS does not track the subsequent labour market outcomes of those who re-enter the labour force. To support the return of females back into the labour force, the Adapt and Grow initiative by MOM and Workforce Singapore (WSG) offers a suite of job matching services and programmes to help jobseekers overcome mismatches in skills, wages or job expectations. One of the programmes is Career Trial, which provides opportunities for jobseekers to try out jobs and assess new careers. This year, we are enhancing Career Trial to include part-time jobs. This will benefit women who are considering part-time jobs, in particular those with care-giving responsibilities. \"},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mr K Shanmugam: Ms Lim's questions refer to the incident where Mr Li Yipeng was taken for a ride on 15 March 2019.The man was driving a private, rented car. The car was not licensed for ride-sharing. Five months earlier, in November 2018, Grab had terminated the man's contract for driving a private hire car without proper decals and also for suspected touting. Since the man did not have a car licensed to pick up passengers, he could not, (amongst other things), pick up passengers from the roadside. The man recognised Mr Li as the Prime Minister's son. He picked up Mr Li who was waiting for a hail taxi. Mr Li is a vulnerable person. It is public knowledge that Mr Li has Asperger's syndrome, a mild form of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) characterised by significant difficulties in social interaction and in non-verbal communication. This is compounded by Mr Li's albinism, which results in his having very poor eyesight.The driver then filmed his interactions with Mr Li using his handphone, apparently while driving, and subsequently circulated the videos. In the confined setting of his car, the man can be heard (in a video), repeatedly asking Mr Li to confirm his identity, residential address and security arrangements. Leaving aside Mr Li's background, it is very troubling when an individual picks up any vulnerable person, whether adult or child, and puts that person in such a situation. I am sure the Member, like most people, will be deeply concerned by what happened. The man put Mr Li in an uncomfortable situation, apparently exploited the situation, filmed it, and then circulated it.   The videos came to the Police's attention. The man’s conduct in the videos showed, prima facie, infractions of the law. Police began investigations immediately. In addition to the infractions, the Police were concerned from the security perspective as well, for a number of reasons. The man made repeated references to Rochalie Drive, and pressed Mr Li on the security arrangements at PM's home. The questions he asked showed that he already knew Mr Li's identity. The man had picked up Mr Li without possessing a street hailing licence, and he had criminal antecedents:(a) A conviction in 2014 for taking a vehicle without owner’s consent under the Road Traffic Act;(b) With the offence of Driving a Motor Vehicle without Insurance in respect to Third-Party Risks under the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act taken into consideration;(c) A warning for theft in dwelling in 2002; and,(d) A report made against him for criminal intimidation in 2014.When asked by the media, the Police confirmed these investigations. The Minister for Home Affairs directed the Police to state the man's antecedents, without disclosing his name.It was in the public interest for the Police to give a fuller explanation and background why they were investigating the matter. If the Police did not set out their security concerns, the public may not grasp why the Police were investigating the matter, and may even misunderstand the Police's actions. It was important to provide the public relevant and specific facts, in order to maintain public confidence in the Police Force. The Member has also asked about Rules and Guidelines on what information can be published. Police decisions on what information to disclose are guided by existing legal requirements. With the proliferation of social media, public agencies will from time to time need to release information faster than used to be the case. It may not always be possible in all cases to wait for a trial to commence or be concluded, a process which may take weeks or months, before releasing relevant facts to the public. When the Police assess that it is necessary to release information earlier, they will do so, while being careful not to prejudice any investigations or legal proceedings that may follow. \"},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr K Shanmugam: The Member asks about why the Court accepted a document in evidence. The Courts make their decisions independently. We will know the reasons for a decision, if they give the reasons in a judgment. There was also no conclusion or finding made by the Singapore Medical Council Disciplinary Tribunal (DT) as to whether the memorandum was admitted into evidence or relied on by the court in granting the Personal Protection Order (PPO). The DT observed that there was \"no clear evidence\" that the PPO had been granted because of the disclosure of the memorandum. At the very most, the facts showed that the memorandum had been produced in the application for a PPO (see Singapore Medical Council v Dr Soo Shuen Chiang [2018] SMCDT 11 at [25]).PPO proceedings are held in the Family Justice Courts (FJC). Proceedings in FJC are conducted in camera. Likewise in this case. In addition, FJC had not issued its grounds of decision. There is thus no appeal filed by either party to the PPO proceedings. Therefore, there are no publicly-known facts as to whether the memorandum was indeed admitted into evidence or relied on by FJC.The Singapore Medical Council has taken steps to pursue an appeal against the DT\\'s decision. On appeal, the Court could possibly look into the surrounding facts, including the circumstances in which the memorandum was procured.

       "  'answer': 'Mrs Josephine Teo: In the past three years, there were on average about 50 gender-related discrimination complaints reported to the Tripartite Alliance on Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) and Ministry of Manpower (MOM) annually, constituting 12% of the total number of complaints each year. The vast majority of these 50 complaints related to employers specifying their preference for a particular gender in their recruitment advertisements. About half of these were substantiated following investigations; as a result, MOM imposed sanctions on the employers, such as curtailing their work pass privileges. For the rest, investigations did not substantiate the complaints. In the last three years, TAFEP received an average of about 10 workplace harassment complaints each year. For workplace harassment complaints which do not disclose a criminal offence, TAFEP notifies the employers and advises them to handle the complaint as an internal workplace matter by conducting an investigation, taking corrective actions and setting up mechanisms to handle future complaints appropriately, as outlined in the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices (TGFEP). All the employers so notified had conducted the necessary enquiries and instituted the appropriate corrective measures. Hence, TAFEP has not needed to impose any sanctions on employers for refusing to take action. MOM also received about 70 pregnancy-related dismissal appeals annually in the past three years. This includes appellants who felt that they were wrongfully dismissed or forced to resign, or denied of maternity benefits. The number of cases that were substantiated and resulted in compensation to the employees remained relatively stable at about 50 per year. The other 20 cases were either dismissed as they were not substantiated or withdrawn by the employees. MOM takes a serious view of workplace discrimination, including discrimination on the grounds of gender. We expect all employers to comply with our legislation, and abide by the principles of fair and merit-based employment practices outlined in the TGFEP.

       "  'answer': 'Mrs Josephine Teo: In the last three years, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and Central Provident Fund (CPF) Board received a total of 308 cases of suspected misclassification. In 160 cases, workers were assessed to be misclassified as self-employed persons (SEPs)1. Each case that MOM and CPF Board investigate into could involve more than one worker. On average, about 100 workers per year were found to be misclassified. In all but two of these misclassification cases, employers made good their obligations when informed of the misclassification, and paid back the affected employees what they were due, including overtime pay and CPF contributions. Penalties including warning and late payment interest charges were meted out to the companies. The two companies which refused to make the necessary payments to the affected employees were prosecuted. One subsequently fully settled the arrears out of Court while the other is currently appealing against its conviction. The majority of these cases occurred in the contract labour suppliers, transport and logistics, construction and education sectors.

       "  'answer': 'Mrs Josephine Teo: In the past three years, there were on average about 50 gender-related discrimination complaints reported to the Tripartite Alliance on Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) and Ministry of Manpower (MOM) annually, constituting 12% of the total number of complaints each year. The vast majority of these 50 complaints related to employers specifying their preference for a particular gender in their recruitment advertisements. About half of these were substantiated following investigations; as a result, MOM imposed sanctions on the employers, such as curtailing their work pass privileges. For the rest, investigations did not substantiate the complaints. In the last three years, TAFEP received an average of about 10 workplace harassment complaints each year. For workplace harassment complaints which do not disclose a criminal offence, TAFEP notifies the employers and advises them to handle the complaint as an internal workplace matter by conducting an investigation, taking corrective actions and setting up mechanisms to handle future complaints appropriately, as outlined in the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices (TGFEP). All the employers so notified had conducted the necessary enquiries and instituted the appropriate corrective measures. Hence, TAFEP has not needed to impose any sanctions on employers for refusing to take action. MOM also received about 70 pregnancy-related dismissal appeals annually in the past three years. This includes appellants who felt that they were wrongfully dismissed or forced to resign, or denied of maternity benefits. The number of cases that were substantiated and resulted in compensation to the employees remained relatively stable at about 50 per year. The other 20 cases were either dismissed as they were not substantiated or withdrawn by the employees. MOM takes a serious view of workplace discrimination, including discrimination on the grounds of gender. We expect all employers to comply with our legislation, and abide by the principles of fair and merit-based employment practices outlined in the TGFEP. We urge all individuals who feel that they have been discriminated against to approach TAFEP and MOM for advice and assistance. MOM will not hesitate to take strong actions against errant employers.'},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mrs Josephine Teo: In the last three years, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and Central Provident Fund (CPF) Board received a total of 308 cases of suspected misclassification. In 160 cases, workers were assessed to be misclassified as self-employed persons (SEPs)1. Each case that MOM and CPF Board investigate into could involve more than one worker. On average, about 100 workers per year were found to be misclassified. In all but two of these misclassification cases, employers made good their obligations when informed of the misclassification, and paid back the affected employees what they were due, including overtime pay and CPF contributions. Penalties including warning and late payment interest charges were meted out to the companies. The two companies which refused to make the necessary payments to the affected employees were prosecuted. One subsequently fully settled the arrears out of Court while the other is currently appealing against its conviction. The majority of these cases occurred in the contract labour suppliers, transport and logistics, construction and education sectors. The common occupations where such misclassification occurred include promoters, drivers, crane operators, service agents and carpenters. The proportion of SEPs has remained stable at 8-10% of the resident workforce over the last decade.

       "  'question': 'Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether the lithium-ion batteries used by electric bicycles, PMDs and other electric devices should be designated as controlled goods under the Consumer Protection (Safety Requirements) Regulations to reduce the increasing incidences of fire caused by their charging.',\n",
       "  'answer': 'Mr Chan Chun Sing: Electrical devices such as Power Assisted Bicycles (\"PABs\") and motorised Personal Mobility Devices (\"PMDs\") should be tested for their safety as a whole, rather than having components such as lithium-ion batteries tested in isolation. Unlike most consumer electrical devices, PMDs and PABs are exposed to harsher conditions such as wet weather and uneven ground. In this regard, the testing of the device as a whole, takes into consideration of how the overall design and materials used are able to withstand expected operating conditions of the device.To safeguard fire safety risks, the Land Transport Authority (\"LTA\") announced earlier that it will require all motorised PMDs intended for use on public paths to be certified to the UL2272 standard from 1 January 2021. PABs that are approved after 1 February 2016 for use on public road and paths are also required to adhere to the EN15194 standard. Both the UL2272 and EN15194 standards can improve the fire and electrical safety of PMDs and PABs respectively.Enterprise Singapore (\"ESG\") oversees the product safety of 33 categories of common household appliances, including power adaptors used to charge PABs and motorised PMDs through the Consumer Protection (Safety Requirements) Regulations (\"CPSR\"). These goods have to be registered with ESG, and affixed with the Safety Mark before they can be sold in Singapore. In addition, ESG administers the Consumer Protection (Consumer Goods Safety Requirements) Regulations (\"CGSR\"), which requires general consumer products not regulated under any other legislations to meet applicable international or regional safety standards. ESG conducts post-market testing, and suppliers found with non compliant products will be asked to rectify or stop sale.Consumers should also be aware that the usage of every product will carry inherent risks. We strongly encourage consumers to exercise vigilance when purchasing and charging electrical devices. When purchasing PABs and PMDs, consumers should buy from reputable sources and be alert to prices which look too good to be true. Besides ensuring that the Safety Mark is on the adaptor, consumers should also avoid overcharging or tampering with the electrical components of their devices.'},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Assisted Reproduction Programme (ARP) insurance scheme provides protection against unexpected cost of neonatal care incurred by babies conceived via in-vitro fertilisation (IVF), in the event that specialised care is required. It provides a cash benefit of $150 or $300 per day, if the baby is admitted to a Special Care Nursery or a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) respectively. Since 1994, couples are required to purchase ARP insurance when they enroll for IVF, as MediShield did not previously cover neonatal conditions.With the introduction of MediShield Life, it now provides universal coverage for all Singapore Citizens (SC) from birth. It provides coverage of up to $700 per day of normal ward hospitalisation and $1,200 per day of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) hospitalisation. The MediSave Grant for Newborns (MGN), introduced since 2012, can also be used to offset hospitalisation costs, up to the MediSave withdrawal limits of $450 per day. We will also be extending MediShield Life coverage to serious pregnancy or delivery complications, which will take effect from 1 April 2019.MOH has therefore decided to remove the requirement for couples to purchase ARP insurance before undergoing IVF, effective 1 April 2019. Insurers may continue to offer ARP insurance or similar products, if they assess that there is sufficient demand. Couples who wish to have additional coverage beyond MediShield Life and MediSave, can still purchase ARP insurance or other maternity insurance plans in the private insurance market to meet their needs.'},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Khaw Boon Wan: To improve public safety and reduce the risk of fire incidents for power assisted bicycles (PABs) and personal mobility devices (PMDs), the Land Transport Authority (LTA) is progressively introducing new standards to improve the fire and electrical safety of these devices. In 2016, we introduced a requirement that only PABs that are compliant with the EN15194 standard can be approved for use and sold in Singapore. From 1 July 2019 onwards, only UL2272-certified motorised PMDs can be sold in Singapore for use on public paths. From 1 January 2021 onwards, all motorised PMDs used on public paths will be required to be certified to the UL2272 standard.In 2018, there were 22 PAB-related fires and 52 PMD-related fires. Based on information available to the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) and LTA, none of the PABs or PMDs involved in the fires are known to be certified to the EN15194 or UL2272 standards respectively.Even before the implementation of the UL2272 standard by 2021, we strongly encourage PMD owners to switch to UL2272 certified devices in order to minimise the risk of fire incidents. When purchasing devices, consumers are advised to buy from reputable sources and look out for fire safety standards. Consumers should also avoid overcharging batteries, modifying their devices or tampering with the electrical components of their devices.

       "  'answer': \"Mrs Josephine Teo: 85% of the claims filed under the Employment Claims Act (ECA) were resolved at the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM). The remaining 15% of the claimants were referred to the Employment Claims Tribunals (ECT), and of which 5% were withdrawn while 10% filed for adjudication. Two-thirds of the adjudicated claims resulted in money orders issued to employers to settle the salary claims; this proportion is similar for both local and foreign employees.Of the ECT orders issued, about half of the claimants received full payment from their employers. Another 16% reported partial payment, while 36% reported no payment. Cases that resulted in partial or no payment usually involved employers in financial difficulty, or large accumulated salary arrears before the employee reported to TADM.

       "  'answer': 'Mrs Josephine Teo: Non-reporting occurs mostly because employers disputed that the injury was work-related, or was not informed of the injury. Before 2018, we focused on educating employers to have better systems to detect and surface injuries suffered by their employees, and to report injuries brought to their attention even if they believe the injuries were not work-related. Since the start of 2018, we have stepped up our enforcement efforts which led to an increase in the number of employers being taken to task for non-reporting.In addition to the 40 composition fine cases, a site manager was convicted in 2016 for attempting to cover up a workplace accident by abandoning the injured worker along an alley.

Parties can seek mediation through a neutral third party, such as a grassroots leader, or approach the Community Mediation Centre (CMC) for help. Persons who suspect that their neighbours are displaying disturbing behaviours due to mental health issues can contact Agency for Integrated Care (AIC), which will assess and make the necessary referral for medical assistance and social support. Agencies, such as HDB and PA, grassroots leaders, voluntary welfare organisations and the AIC will come together to find a sustainable solution with the parties involved.Where community-based solutions are not sufficient, we have other laws and procedures that allow parties to deal with persons with mental health conditions who are posing disruption to the community.(a) If the person is becoming a risk to himself, or poses a danger to others, the Police can apprehend the person and take him to a doctor. The doctor will assess the person's mental health, and send the person to a psychiatric institution for treatment if necessary.(b) For intractable cases where parties are unable to resolve their disputes through voluntary mediation, parties can file a case with the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals (CDRT) as a last resort. The CDRT judge can order the parties to attend mandatory mediation or attend counselling, or fix the case for hearing if mediation and counselling are not suitable.(c) If a respondent breaches the CDRT's order, his affected neighbour can apply to CDRT for a Special Direction (SD) for the respondent to comply with the order. The CDRT can order a third party, such as the respondent's family member, to enter into a bond with conditions that the respondent goes for psychiatric assessment or treatment.

The costs are determined based on service requirements set out for each care service. The average of the costs across the long term care provided by different service providers, the \"Norm Cost\", is then used as a reference to determine the funding for the services.As care models, cost structures and productivity vary across service providers, some could have costs that are higher than the norm cost, while others could have costs that are lower.MOH provides means-tested subsidies of up to 80% for long term care services. Singaporeans who require additional help after the subsidies can apply for financial assistance such as MediFund. Some VWOs provide additional assistance to their clients through charity dollars raised. Some may also choose to provide additional facilities and services using their charity funds.

For the remaining claims, determining validity took a longer time because of delays due to various parties.Common reasons for delays include incomplete information provided by the injured employee, difficulty in locating and getting witnesses to come forward, and having to wait for medical assessments of whether an injury occurred or not, in cases where injuries were not visible.For cases that took more than six months, they are mainly due to fraudulent claims investigation.

       "  'answer': 'Mr Ong Ye Kung: MOE introduced streaming in 1980 to systematically customise learning for students of different profiles. It has very successfully lowered student attrition and improved educational outcomes.Factors impacting self-esteem and confidence are complex and multi-faceted. NIE studies have shown that some Normal Academic students, after spending some years in secondary schools, were similar or more confident academically relative to some Express students. But there is also feedback from teachers that students in Normal Streams may over time also lose confidence and the mindset of growth and development.The trade-off between customisation and stigmatisation is something we need to recognise. That is why over the years, MOE has taken steps, through measures such as out-of-stream subjects, subject-based banding and the Polytechnic Foundation Programme, to blur the lines between education streams.

Thereafter, they can progress further to Secondary 5 N(A) and sit for the GCE O-Level examination.

       "  'answer': 'Mrs Josephine Teo: In December 2018, there were about 268,000 CPF members aged 65 and above who received retirement payouts from either the CPF LIFE or Retirement Sum Scheme. About half of these recipients are females. Among the 76% of members who are property owners, 17% own private property, 54% own 4-room-and-larger HDB flats while 29% own 3-room-and-under HDB flats.Of those who received payouts, 74% had monthly payouts under $500. The average monthly payouts differs greatly across the generations; the average monthly payout for CPF members aged 65 to 69 is more than double that of members aged 80 to 87.In addition to CPF payouts, members may receive additional retirement support from the Government through the Silver Support scheme. This provides them with an average income supplement of about $600 per quarter, which is in addition to the other forms of Government support such as the Workfare Income Supplement, GST vouchers and ComCare.With increased labour force participation and improvements to the CPF system made in the past decade, we expect younger cohorts to have higher CPF payouts. For example, about 6 in 10 active members turning age 55 in 2017 have at least the CPF Basic Retirement Sum (BRS) in their Retirement Accounts. The BRS of $83,000 at age 55 in 2017 will give members a monthly payout of about $700 to $750 for life.The Member also asked about sharing of CPF microdata.

       "  'answer': 'Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): Loss of personal data by Government agencies is reported to the police when there is suspected foul play, or when a physical asset such as a laptop is missing. Over the past three years, the Government made 41 such reports to the police. These reports have been made in a timely manner, with 80% submitted on the same day as the discovery of the incident. These incidents are not reported to the PDPC, as it is not their function to investigate such Government-related incidents. In seven of these 41 incidents, the individuals affected were notified. In another four of these incidents, both the individuals affected and the general public were informed. Among these 11 cases, it took an average of three weeks from the police report to notify the individual. This was the time taken to identify the exact individuals affected, and assess the extent of loss, to give an accurate report of the situation to the affected individuals, and to recover or safeguard evidence for potential future prosecution. The time required varies from case to case depending on the complexity of the incident.The remaining 30 police reports concern loss of physical assets such as laptops. No specific individual’s data was compromised. Government laptops are protected by encryption and laptops that are reported lost will be immediately blocked from the Government network. Nevertheless, a lost laptop remains a serious concern and the agency affected will work with the Police to make a best effort to recover it.From time to time, there are also incidents of data mishandling that are reported internally but not to the police. Such incidents typically involve the accidental mailing of letters containing personal information to the wrong recipient; or mass emails in which officers mistakenly included all recipients’ email addresses in the cc field rather than the bcc field.

This has allowed more Singaporeans to tap on more of their MediSave for outpatient treatments. The statistics for 2018 are not yet available.  In 2016 and 2017, about 17% of Singaporeans aged 65 years old and above with chronic conditions and about 16% of those who used MediSave for outpatient diagnostic scans had fully utilised their respective MediSave limits.

       "  'answer': \"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Skin cancer was the 9th most common cancer among Singaporeans from 2013-2017. 10% of cases were below 50 years old, although the incidence of new cases in this group increased from 1.2 to 2.7 per 100,000 persons from 1983-1987 to 2013-2017 respectively. Studies have linked cumulative exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light with an increased risk of skin cancer. However, exposure to sunlight has health benefits as it is important for Vitamin D formation and hence for healthy bone formation. Sufficient time outdoors can also help prevent or delay myopia in children. Singapore Armed Forces soldiers are provided with Personal Protective Equipment, such as head gear and long-sleeved combat uniform, that protects them from sun exposure. Physical training conducted in sports attire and swimming kit are typically conducted in the early mornings or late afternoons when sunlight is less intense.  Likewise, in Ministry of Education schools, outdoors activities are generally conducted in the early mornings and late afternoons to minimise students' exposure to UV light. Frequent rest and water breaks under shade are incorporated into activities carried out during other parts of the day. Students are also taught to use sunscreen, broad-brimmed hats and caps, long sleeved shirts, and sunglasses to protect themselves against excessive UV exposure. There are no known local studies regarding skin cancer among young persons as the incidence of skin cancer remains low in this group. Nevertheless, it is prudent that Singaporeans take measures to protect themselves from prolonged exposure to UV light and see a doctor early if they develop symptoms.\"},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The provision of dental services, such as veneers and teeth whitening services is a practice of dentistry. Under the Dental Registration Act, only a registered dentist is allowed to practice dentistry in Singapore. The practice must be conducted in a premise licensed under the Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act. In the past three years, there were five reported cases on home-based dental services. Investigations into these cases are on-going. The Ministry takes a serious view of the practice of dentistry being performed by non-dentists in unlicensed premises and will not hesitate to take tough enforcement action against any person who contravenes the law. It is unlawful for any person not registered with the Singapore Dental Council to provide dental services. If found guilty, the person shall be liable to a fine not exceeding $25,000. Repeat offenders can be fined up to $50,000 or to an imprisonment for up to six months or to both. Additionally, any person found operating an unlicensed premise shall be liable to a fine not exceeding $20,000 or to a jail term not more than two years or to both.The Ministry advises the public to be cautious about using healthcare services from unfamiliar sources. When in doubt, they should seek advice from their regular doctor or dentist or can check the list of licensed healthcare institutions and registered healthcare professionals on MOH's and relevant professional board's websites. The Ministry will step up our efforts on consumer education regarding unlawful dental services.\"},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr K Shanmugam: Between 2017 and 2018, there were 14 calls and letters from members of the public to Traffic Police (\"TP\") on speeding vehicles along Upper Bukit Timah Road, of which eight cases took place at night. In all 14 cases, the stretch of road outside the two condominiums was not cited. There were, however, 15 road traffic accidents on this stretch of road during the same period. Speeding was likely to have been the cause for only one of the accidents. Eight of the accidents involved vehicles that had been making right turns or U-turns. To help motorists make right turns and U-turns more safely, LTA will install red-amber-green arrow lights at some traffic junctions along Upper Bukit Timah Road, including the stretch of road outside the two condominiums, by the end of this year.

       "  'answer': 'Mr Gan Kim Yong: Teeth whitening products are regulated as cosmetic products under the Health Products (Cosmetic Products – ASEAN Cosmetic Directive) Regulations. They usually contain hydrogen peroxide, a bleaching agent, which may pose a risk of damage to the teeth and gums if used inappropriately.  To safeguard the public, only those preparations containing 0.1% of hydrogen peroxide or less are allowed to be sold directly to consumers. Those containing more than 0.1% can only be supplied or used by registered dentists. The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) monitors the safety of health products, including cosmetics, sold in the local market. HSA conducts regular checks on the products, including those sold online. Sellers of unsafe products will be ordered to remove such products from the market. When online sale of unsafe cosmetic products are detected, HSA will work with the administrators of online platforms to remove the listings of the affected products. Any person found to contravene the regulation is liable to a fine up to $50,000 or imprisonment up to two years, or both.  Given the widespread reach of the internet, consumers play an important part in safeguarding their own health.

       "  'answer': 'Mr K Shanmugam: The number of reported bicycle thefts has been on a downward trend in the past three years. In 2018, there were 522 cases, compared to 979 in 2016, and around 1,100-1,200 each year between 2011-2015.The Bicycle Security Label scheme was started in 2011. About 150,000 labels were issued, before the scheme was discontinued in 2017.Police found that the scheme had limited effectiveness in tackling bicycle thefts. For one thing, it was not difficult to tamper with the labels. There are more effective ways to solve bicycle theft cases, such as through the use of CCTV footages to identify the culprits.Police have channelled resources to raise public awareness on preventing bicycle thefts, especially on the use of secure bicycle locks. Police have also worked with LTA and shopping malls to install CCTVs covering designated bicycle parking areas. The expansion of PolCam has also helped to deter and solve theft cases. With these efforts, the number of bicycle theft cases has fallen significantly, by over 57% since 2015.'},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Gan Kim Yong: MediFund utilisation has increased over the last decade, to $150 million in FY17. The increase was higher in the earlier years. Since FY16, the figure has been more stable, following the introduction of MediShield Life and Pioneer Generation package, both of which extended more healthcare financing support.There are a few reasons for the increase in MediFund utilisation over the past decade: First, we have been helping more Singaporeans, as we expanded our public healthcare capacity to serve more patients. Over the last decade, the number of MediFund applications increased by close to 10% annually, on average.Second, we have expanded the scope of coverage of MediFund to cover more services and conditions. For example, MediFund was extended to cover non-residential intermediate and long term care services in 2012, and to polyclinics, dental services, antenatal and delivery services in 2013.Third, we have been providing greater support to those with greater healthcare needs. For example, we have enhanced the scheme through the introduction of MediFund Silver in 2007 and MediFund Junior in 2013 to better target support for young and elderly Singaporeans respectively.We will continue to monitor the MediFund utilisation to ensure that it is sustainable and no Singaporean is denied appropriate healthcare due to an inability to pay.'},\n",

       "  'question': 'Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) how will Singapore be impacted by a no-deal Brexit; and (b) how will Brexit affect the rectification and implementation of the EU-Singapore Free Trade Agreement.',\n",
       "  'answer': 'Mr Chan Chun Sing: The UK is the second largest economy in the EU and the fifth largest globally. It is also an important economic partner of Singapore. Like other countries, we are keeping a close watch on Brexit, which remains set for 29 March 2019. There are three possible scenarios. First, the UK and the EU agreeing on a Withdrawal Agreement. Second, the UK exits the EU without any deal, that is, \"Hard Brexit\". Third, a scenario in which the UK\\'s formal departure from the EU is postponed beyond 29 March 2019. Under the first scenario, the Withdrawal Agreement will include an \"Implementation Period\" that will last till 31 December 2020. This scenario offers the greatest predictability and stability while minimising disruption to businesses. This is because during the Implementation Period, the UK will continue to be functionally treated as an EU Member State, and remain a party to EU international agreements – including the EU-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (EUSFTA) when it is ratified by the European Parliament as targeted in 2019. Under the second no-deal scenario, the UK will cease to be a party to the EU\\'s agreements with third countries when it formally leaves the EU on 29 March 2019. This would mean that the EUSFTA will not apply between the UK and Singapore even after its entry into force. This in itself would not impact our trading relationship with the UK as the current tariff and non-tariff regime for Singapore companies trading with the UK are based on WTO terms which would continue to apply. Under the third scenario, the UK\\'s formal departure from the EU will be postponed to a date after 29 March 2019. This would entail the UK extending the Article 50 timeline, subject to the unanimous approval of all EU Member States. The prospect of an imminent no-deal Brexit would be diminished, although we may see a period of continued uncertainty. Singapore and the UK share substantial trade and investment linkages, with many of our businesses operating in each other\\'s markets across sectors such as pharmaceuticals, professional services and consumer goods. MTI\\'s assessment is that trade between the UK and Singapore will not be fundamentally impaired. Nonetheless, owing to the integrated nature of today\\'s global supply chains as well as the extensive trade linkages that spans the UK, EU, and the rest of the world, a no-deal Brexit could weigh on consumer and business sentiments in the UK and EU, with potential negative effects on global growth. MTI and Enterprise Singapore will continue working closely with Singapore companies to help with any near term company-specific disruption. This will include facilitating link-ups between companies and the appropriate authorities to work through continuity issues in areas such as labour and talent supply, or delays in shipments that might be routed between the UK and the EU. MTI is also in close contact with UK economic agencies on measures to strengthen our strong trade and investment relations. We have several bilateral platforms with the UK, such as the UK-Singapore Economic and Business Partnership (EBP) and the recently launched UK-Singapore Partnership for the Future (P4F). Singapore is also prepared to work with the UK to apply the EUSFTA in a UK-Singapore context that could form the basis of a future Singapore-UK trade agreement.The ratification of the EUSFTA and EU-Singapore Investment Protection Agreement (EUSIPA) is on track. The ratification process is not affected by Brexit, and both agreements are expected to be voted on by the European Parliament during its next sitting from 11 to 14 February 2019. Pending clarity on post-Brexit arrangements, any consequential amendments to the EUSFTA can be addressed during the implementation phase.'},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: In 2017, about 810,000 tonnes of food waste was generated. Food waste is one of our largest waste streams and has a relatively low recycling rate. It remains one of our priority waste streams this year, the Year Towards Zero Waste, together with e-waste and packaging waste. My Ministry takes a multi-pronged approach to addressing food waste, which includes encouraging food waste reduction, food redistribution, and recycling. Since 2015, NEA has been running a food waste reduction campaign that includes media publicity to raise awareness, and outreach programmes on ways to reduce food wastage in households. Educational materials such as the Food Waste Handy Guide, which has tips to help consumers reduce food waste, are made available online and at community road shows. NEA started the \"Love Your Food @ Schools\" programme in April 2017, which encourages schools to minimise food waste. To help the food and beverage industry reduce food wastage, NEA and the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) launched food waste minimisation guidebooks for food retail establishments, supermarkets, and food manufacturing establishments to provide guidance on reducing food waste across the supply chain. Guidelines on the proper handling and redistribution of unsold or excess food are also incorporated to facilitate food redistribution. To promote food waste recycling, NEA supports companies through its 3R Fund, to implement projects such as the installation of on-site food waste treatment systems. NEA has so far co-funded 21 on-site food waste treatment systems. We also conducted a \"Food Waste, Don\\'t Waste!\" pilot at Tampines Greenlace HDB estate, where residents segregated their food waste and disposed of it in dedicated food waste bins on the ground floor. The food waste was then recycled at Our Tampines Hub to produce fertiliser and non-potable water.This multi-pronged approach has begun to yield results. Food waste recycling has increased from 13% in 2015 to 16% in 2017. Nonetheless, there is much more we can do.As part of our Year Towards Zero Waste efforts, my Ministry will continue to explore measures to better manage food waste in homes, schools, workplaces, and food and beverage establishments. These measures will also be part of our inaugural Zero Waste Masterplan to be launched this year. However, the Government cannot do this alone. This is why we have set aside $2 million this year to fund ground-up projects related to Zero Waste. We will also consult the public and engage non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to seek their views and ideas and co-create initiatives to better manage food waste. '},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Ong Ye Kung: Counselling issues vary in causes and complexity, and schools and Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) have varying ways of tracking them. We estimate that in 2018, around 10 out of every 1,000 students at schools and IHLs received counselling support for anxiety or stress-related issues.

       "  'answer': \"Mr Lawrence Wong: The URA's Property Price Index (PPI) captures all private housing transactions, including new sales (units sold by developers), resales and sub-sales; the HDB's Resale Price Index (RPI) captures all HDB resale flat transactions. Insofar as there are underlying factors that affect both the public and private property markets, the two indices would tend to move together. But there have been instances of divergence in the PPI and RPI price trends. This has happened in the past, and more recently between 2Q2017 and 3Q2018. The recent divergence was largely due to euphoric sentiments in the private property market. This resulted in a sharp increase in private property prices over a very short duration. This was not sustainable as prices were increasing well ahead of fundamentals. Hence the government had moved to introduce the last round of cooling measures in July last year.

       "  'answer': \"Mr Desmond Lee: The Ministry of Social and Family Development's (MSF) Social Service Offices (SSOs) carry out two main functions. First, the SSOs deliver financial assistance to low-income individuals and families, and link them up to various agencies for their other needs, such as housing, employment and family services. The objective is to ensure that these individuals or families receive comprehensive help. For example, where there are families with complex needs that require interfaces with multiple agencies, SSOs can step in to facilitate discussions or convene case conferences where needed. Second, the SSOs do ground sensing and local services planning, working closely with community partners to coordinate the planning and delivery of social services in the community. The demands on our SSOs are growing. Over the years, the number of ComCare applications has increased, in large part because of increased awareness of available help schemes with the rollout of the network of 24 SSOs. Our SSOs are located within HDB towns, so that those in need can access help easily. The number of complex cases requiring coordination by the SSOs has also grown. To respond to these challenges amid tighter manpower constraints, MSF is taking a multi-pronged approach. First, we are leveraging technology like video-conferencing to enhance productivity and efficiency at the SSOs. Second, we are strengthening backend inter-agency coordination, supported by enhanced protocols, data-sharing, and town-level SG Community Networks sessions. Third, we are using data analytics to inform resource planning and optimise deployment across our SSOs. These strategies ensure that our SSOs work efficiently yet effectively to serve vulnerable individuals and families. MSF periodically reviews the SSOs' manpower needs, and will continue to monitor our operations, and adjust the level of required resourcing accordingly. Even as the SSOs step up to pull together efforts to help vulnerable families, we also appreciate the active contributions by the community and every Singaporean to this collective effort of giving those in need a leg up to regain stability, and building a caring society.\"},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mrs Josephine Teo: We recognise that CPF members have varying needs in retirement. This is why we have provided members with a number of options to have flexibility in their CPF retirement payouts. At age 55, CPF members are required to set aside savings up to their cohort Full Retirement Sum (FRS) in the Retirement Account (RA). Members with sufficient property charge or pledge can also choose to set aside the Basic Retirement Sum (BRS) instead. Members will then receive a steady stream of monthly payouts in retirement depending on the amount they have in their RAs. Members can consider the following options if they wish to receive higher payouts:(a) Set aside a higher amount in their RA, up to the prevailing Enhanced Retirement Sum (ERS). This can be done by topping up their RA in cash, or transferring CPF savings from their own Ordinary or Special Accounts or from their family member's CPF accounts to their RA.(b) Start payouts later. Deferring the start of payouts will increase their payout quantum, duration or both. Members can also choose the CPF LIFE Escalating Plan that provides lower payouts at first and subsequently higher payouts that increase at 2% every year.  Beyond these options, members can also further adjust their payouts through CPF transfers and cash top-ups, even after they have started their payouts. Overall, we have to carefully balance providing members with flexibility to meet their diverse needs with the need to keep the CPF system adequate and simple. CPF members can approach CPF Board to better understand how the different payout options can meet their needs.\"},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mrs Josephine Teo: (a) Number of CPF members who have reached their withdrawal limits  Currently, about 740,000 property owners use their CPF savings to service their housing instalments. Of these, about 6,000 (0.8%) property owners have reached their withdrawal limits for housing and are using other means to finance their mortgage. They include members who have reached the Valuation Limit (VL) but cannot use more of their CPF savings for housing as they do not have at least the Basic Retirement Sum (BRS), or members who took bank loans and have reached the Withdrawal Limit (WL) cap set at 120% VL. (b) Number of CPF members who appeal to use Special and/or Retirement Account savings The Special Account (SA) and Retirement Account (RA) savings are safeguarded for members' retirement needs, and generally cannot be used for housing purposes.  That said, CPF Board exercised flexibility in some cases. For example, CPF Board has allowed CPF members to use their RA savings that originated from their Ordinary Account (OA) to pay for their housing on appeal, even if their RA savings are below the BRS. In 2018, CPF Board granted about 8,000 appeals to use their RA savings for housing.

Our hawker culture is a total cultural experience of the place, the food, and the people, that binds us together as Singaporeans.

       "  'answer': 'Mr S Iswaran: The Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) administers the regulatory regime for Arts Entertainment (AE) which include plays, variety shows, and art exhibitions. In assessing and classifying an AE, IMDA is guided by the Arts Entertainment Classification Code (AECC) which sets out the classification system and the principles of classification. The AECC was developed in consultation with the community and aims to reflect prevailing social norms, protect the young from unsuitable content while enabling adults to make informed viewing choices. There are four classification ratings for AE: (i) General; (ii) Advisory; (iii) Advisory 16; and (iv) Restricted 18 (R18). An AE rated R18 is age restricted and can only be viewed by those aged 18 and above. In determining an appropriate rating for an AE, IMDA takes into consideration the overall theme, the content elements, message and impact of the work and its suitability for the different age groups. An AE which deals with a more mature theme or content including LGBT content, would be given a higher classification rating. Content that goes beyond the R18 rating will not be allowed. For an AE rated higher than \"General\", IMDA will issue a consumer advice to highlight content elements within the AE to enable the public to make an informed decision, as well as guide parents on the suitability of the AE for their children. The rating and consumer advice issued by IMDA for an AE must be reflected in all of its publicity materials and at ticketing booths and event venues. \"RuPaul’s Drag Race\" is a variety show and similar shows have been staged previously in Singapore. Past shows have generally been classified R18 in view of the mature content and have not attracted much feedback.

       "  'answer': \"Mr Heng Swee Keat: The Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) was introduced in 2001 as a tax-incentivised scheme to encourage individuals to save voluntarily for retirement, beyond the basic provisions of the CPF. Taken together, the CPF and SRS comprise our system of mandatory and voluntary contributions to help people save for retirement.Each year, MOF publishes the total number of SRS account holders and total SRS contributions. These statistics, dating back to the scheme's inception in 2001, are available on the MOF website. In a given year, about 60% of the account holders contribute to their account.90% of those who made an SRS contribution in the past year have an Assessable Income of more than $80,000, which corresponds to an average marginal tax rate of about 15.0%. In this group, the average contribution in a year has been around $14,000. The remaining 10% who contributed in the past year have an Assessable Income of below $80,000. The average contribution in a year has been around $9,000. Their average marginal tax rate is about 3.2%. This contribution pattern has been fairly stable over the past five years.The details of elasticity and determinants of SRS contribution behaviour are complex. Possible factors include awareness of the scheme, income levels, and personal willingness to set aside more for retirement. Nevertheless, the government will continue to study this matter, together with academics and researchers, to better understand how Singaporeans think about financial planning for retirement.  \"},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Heng Swee Keat: We need to raise revenue to finance our rising spending needs. But we have to do so in a way that ensures our tax system remains fair and internationally competitive.Employment Pass holders make economic contributions to Singapore and pay taxes like Singaporeans. Under our progressive income tax system, those who earn more (including Employment Pass holders) already pay a higher proportion of their income in taxes. Furthermore, under our tax treaties, we are required to not discriminate on the basis of nationality in our income tax treatment. This is in line with the international norms in both the OECD and the United Nations standards for tax treaty provisions.While our income tax treatment does not discriminate on the basis of nationality, our tax reliefs do support various social and economic objectives, especially for those who make Singapore their home. For example, all eligible operationally ready National Servicemen (NSmen) are entitled to NSman tax relief, to recognise their contributions to National Service; and their wives and parents are also granted tax reliefs to recognise the support they give to their husbands and sons.

For example, at the primary level, students learn about conservation, and the negative impact of pollution, global warming, and deforestation on the environment and living things in Science. In Social Studies, students learn about Singapore\\'s physical environment and the importance of using resources responsibly. They also apply their knowledge of the 3Rs: Reduce, Reuse and Recycle in their daily lives as \"Environment Champions\". At the secondary level, the Geography, Science and Social Studies syllabi extend students\\' learning to deeper issues like natural resource depletion, as well as environmental impact of rising global temperature and waste disposal (for example, sewage, toxic chemicals). Students have opportunities to examine and weigh various solutions to achieve environmental sustainability. They also appreciate the inter-dependence of different species in biological ecosystems, understand the importance of conservation and examine the roles of different stakeholders (for example, local communities and business operators) in environmental conservation. Teachers engage students in the learning of these topics through inquiry-based learning, and the use of real-world examples and case studies. Students also participate in excursions and conduct fieldwork, such as at parks and nature reserves, to reinforce their learning. Schools augment the learning in the formal curriculum with a variety of co-curricular activities and learning experiences. For example, many schools have established their own environmental clubs to enable students to do their part for the environment through action. They also participate actively in various environment-themed projects and activities such as the ABC (Active, Beautiful and Clean) Water Trail organised by the Public Utilities Board, the Greenwave environmental competition organised by SembCorp and the Environment Health Institute\\'s workshops on climate change and dengue.

In addition, Singapore also requires reporting of injuries that result in at least 24 hours of hospitalisation.Singapore attained a workplace fatal injury rate of 1.2 per 100,000 employed persons in 2017. This was lower than the average fatal injury rate of 1.7 per 100,000 employed persons among EU countries that use EU-OSHA's reporting criteria.EU-OSHA does not publish minor or major injury data, but does so for non-fatal injuries as a whole. Singapore had a non-fatal injury rate of 368 per 100,000 employed persons in 2017, compared to the EU-OSHA average of 1,586 per 100,000 employed persons. We should, however, be cautious in comparing our non-fatal injury rate with that of the EU. While Singapore and EU-OSHA apply the same threshold of medical leave duration for reporting purposes, differences in data collection systems may account for some variations.

Amongst these flat owners, 224,836 (70% of 320,526) households paid their monthly instalment fully using CPF monies, 44,693 (14%) households paid fully in cash, and 50,997 (16%) households used a combination of cash and CPF monies.   Of the flat owners who took a loan from HDB, the large majority (292,664 or 91%) took a concessionary loan. The interest rate of concessionary HDB loans is pegged at 0.1% above the CPF Ordinary Account interest rate, which is currently at 2.5% and does not change frequently. This has helped to provide certainty to HDB borrowers on their monthly mortgage repayments. At the same time, there were about 169,914 (35% of 490,440) households servicing loans from financial institutions (FIs) for their HDB flats. Of these households, 36,875 (22% of 169,914) owned a 3-room or smaller flat, 73,397 (43%) owned a 4-room flat, 45,381 (27%) owned a 5-room flat, and the remaining 14,261 (8%) owned an Executive or bigger flat. However, as of September 2018, less than one-third of all outstanding housing loans extended by FIs were pegged to floating market interest rates, down from about 60% in 2016. Many FI borrowers have switched to fixed-rate loan packages, which has reduced their vulnerability to market interest rate increases.The government has also put in place measures to encourage financial prudence among borrowers that could help to mitigate the impact of rising market interest rates. For instance, loans for the purchase of HDB flats granted by FIs are subject to a maximum loan amount based on the flat\\'s value and a Mortgage Servicing Ratio (MSR) of 30%, with the latter computed using a medium-term interest rate (currently 3.5%). FIs are also required to provide a Residential Property Loan Fact Sheet when marketing property loans, to help borrowers understand how they will be impacted by higher interest rates.In addition, MAS regularly conducts stress tests on households\\' mortgage exposures. Most HDB owners\\' mortgage payments to FIs are expected to remain manageable under a \"severe stress\" scenario of both higher interest rates and lower household incomes.'},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Chan Chun Sing: Singapore welcomes the G20 Leaders\\' Declaration in advancing the Argentinean Presidency\\'s theme of \"Building Consensus for Fair and Sustainable Development\", which affirms the G20\\'s commitment to pursuing strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth. We also welcome the G20\\'s pledge to work together to improve a rules-based international order that is capable of effectively responding to a rapidly changing world.The rules-based multilateral trading system has provided predictability and stability in the conduct of international trade, facilitated trade and investment liberalisation, fostered cooperation and interdependence between economies, and underpinned global economic growth for decades.The World Trade Organisation (WTO) has made efforts, since its establishment in 1995, to ensure that its rules and core functions remain relevant for business and governments in the face of rapidly evolving trade realities. With more than 160 WTO Members, obtaining consensus can be challenging. Some notable successes include the conclusion of the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) in 2013 and the expansion of the Information Technology Agreement (ITA2) in 2015, which expedite the flow of goods across borders and further liberalise trade in information and communication technology products respectively. However, the pace of reforms needs to be accelerated.This includes updating WTO rules to support and facilitate the growth of the digital economy. Singapore, together with Australia and Japan, drives the WTO Joint Statement Initiative on E-Commerce (JSI), a widely supported endeavour to develop multilateral trade rules on e-commerce which 72 WTO Members accounting for 77% of global trade have signed up to thus far.The WTO\\'s effective functioning is crucial for Singapore, as a small and open economy heavily dependent on trade. WTO reform discussions are taking place in Geneva, and plurilaterally amongst concerned members. Singapore is supportive of all efforts to build up and strengthen the WTO and will continue to contribute to discussions at the WTO and other fora.'},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: We do not track the statistic that Mr Gan has asked for. A study by the National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre (NVPC) in 2013 found that a person's perception of well-being is positively correlated with giving, which includes volunteering or donating. Specifically, 66% of givers, as compared to 45% of non-givers, were more likely to report they experience high levels of well-being1. Giving may increase well-being as volunteers derive deep meaning from helping others, are more grateful for their own life situation, and grow a bigger network of positive social relationships, along with a stronger sense of community. A research in Scotland2 in 2018 found that volunteering benefitted the mental and physical well-being of volunteers, with benefits found to be more significant for older volunteers (60 years and above) who are more subject to loneliness, role-identity loss such as loss of employment or loss of partner/departure of children, and ill health.\"},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Lawrence Wong: Manhole covers within HDB precincts are generally for water, sewerage and telecommunications purposes, and are hence built in accordance to guidelines by PUB and IMDA. As for manhole covers on public roads, these are built by the Utility Providers in accordance to guidelines by LTA. The various guidelines ensure that manhole covers are structurally sound, and fit for purpose. Covers are intended to fit properly with the manhole and should emit minimal noise as a result.HDB receives minimal feedback related to noise from manhole covers on vehicular driveways with interlocking pavers. In the few instances where there have been noise complaints, they were generally due to poor fit of the cover with the manhole. This can usually be addressed by clearing the manhole of debris, replacing covers which have become warped due to long term exposure to the elements, or grinding the cover to achieve a better fit with the manhole. Where such situations arise in HDB precincts, HDB will work with the Town Councils to rectify them.'},\n",

To reinforce this principle, buyers of HDB resale flats are not allowed to retain ownership of local or overseas private properties. Since the policy was introduced in August 2010, slightly over 5,000 households have disposed of their private properties when they purchased flats from the resale market. In the last 3 years, about 1,200 households appealed to retain their private property.

       "  'answer': \"Mr Lawrence Wong: The Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP) is offered to HDB blocks without direct lift access and where the cost cap per benefitting unit can be met.  For blocks that have failed the polling once previously, HDB will evaluate appeals for a second poll provided that Advisers can demonstrate that circumstances have changed since the earlier failed poll. This can be through an informal survey and Advisers should receive at least 75% support from residents before appealing for LUP to be re-offered.To ensure that LUP polls are taken seriously, blocks that are offered LUP a second time will be informed that it will be the final round of LUP polling. We should respect the residents' final decision. Re-opening the polls for the third time is likely to lead to negative feedback from residents who had earlier objected to LUP.

       "  'answer': \"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Health Promotion Board (HPB) and Integrated Health Information Systems (IHiS) investigated a case of unusually high number of attempts to log into HealthHub on four days within a short period (that is, 28 September 2018, 3 October 2018, 8 October 2018 and 9 October 2018). The investigation revealed that attempts were made with more than 27,000 email addresses. 98% of the email addresses used were not related to HealthHub account IDs, and these attempts were unsuccessful. Nevertheless, 72 accounts were successfully accessed during the four days.The high volume of email addresses not related to HealthHub account IDs and the repeated attempts suggest that the email addresses used were likely to have been obtained from other compromised sources. No evidence of a breach in the HealthHub system has been found.The unusual log-in attempts and access were limited to the basic tier of HealthHub, which contained the user's self-populated profile and any Healthpoints accumulated through participation in HPB programmes. Access to other e-services requires SingPass and 2-factor authentication, and were not affected.As a precaution, access to all HealthHub mobile application and HealthHub website e-services were suspended from 9 to 14 October 2018. The 72 HealthHub accounts of concern were locked, and HPB contacted each of the account holders to ascertain if the log-ins were legitimate and to alert them of the access to their accounts. The investigation found that none of the accounts were adversely affected. 15 users had legitimately logged into their accounts, while two users suspected that their accounts were accessed without authorisation. It was inconclusive as to whether the remaining 55 accounts were accessed without authorisation. HPB provided all the 72 account holders with advice on how they could unlock their accounts and reset the passwords.HPB has included a security advisory in HealthHub to remind users on the need to use strong passwords for their online accounts and to refrain from using the same password for different websites and applications. In December 2018, further precautionary measures were also implemented, including (i) introducing an authentication at the point of login that protects against automated attacks by malicious bots; and (ii) introducing a One Time Password (OTP) for the redemption of Healthpoints.IHiS and HPB have not detected further incidents of unusual log-ins since.

       "  'answer': \"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Caregiving needs will grow as our population ages, and the Government is expanding home and community care services, to support families and provide care-givers with peace of mind. As of 2017, we have about 8,300 staff providing direct care1 to seniors in the long-term care sector2. However, families and friends are also an important source of care and support for our seniors. Based on the National Health Surveillance Survey conducted in 2010 and 2013, around 6% – 8% of Singapore residents aged 18 – 69 provide regular informal care or assistance to family and friends with health issues, long-term illnesses or disability. As informal care-giving arrangements vary, we do not have available estimates of the total value of informal care-giving to make a direct comparison with formal care-giving.Some working persons may leave the workforce to focus on family responsibilities. Based on the Ministry of Manpower's 2017 Comprehensive Labour Force Survey, 202,000 residents left their job within the last three years and were not looking for a job. Of this number, about 12,500 residents cited family care-giving to families or relatives as the main reason, and the majority of these residents were females, married and aged 40 and over.We also recognise the important roles that family care-givers play, and the need to take a whole-of-community approach to support them.

       "  'answer': 'Mr Gan Kim Yong: Foreign domestic workers (FDWs) applying to work in Singapore are required to be screened for active TB, including having a chest x-ray, within two weeks of their arrival in Singapore, before they are issued with work permits. FDWs are also required to undergo screening for active TB upon two years of stay in Singapore.From 2013 to 2017, an average of 146 new FDW applicants a year were diagnosed with active TB when they applied for work permit. FDW applicants found to have active TB will not be issued work permits and have to return to their home countries, unless otherwise supported by their prospective employers. In the same period, about 200 FDW work permit holders were diagnosed with active TB per year, out of a FDW population of between 214,500 and 246,800.As active TB can still develop later after screening is negative, it is imperative that persons who display symptoms of active TB, such as unexplained prolonged cough of three weeks or more, seek early medical attention, so that active TB can be detected and treated early. With treatment, persons with active TB rapidly become non-infectious, and would no longer transmit the disease. Strict adherence to TB treatment will help ensure cure and minimise the risk of relapse of the disease.Therefore, to reduce the risk of TB transmission, we seek the support of employers with FDWs displaying TB symptoms to seek medical attention for their FDWs early. Employers should also support and ensure that their FDWs receive TB treatment, via Directly Observed Treatment (DOT), and comply with medical appointments.'},\n",

In the case of Spize Restaurant, it was a Salmonellosis outbreak of unusual severity which suggests that the food was heavily contaminated. There was strong evidence of poor personal hygiene and food handling practices by food handlers leading to contamination of ready-to-eat food and the environment. The operator was also found to have seven unregistered food handlers and preparing food outside of the licensed premises. In the case of Team Catering Pte Ltd, a number of possible commonly-found pathogens were identified from the human stool samples, including Clostridium Perfringens and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and several hygiene lapses and poor kitchen habits were identified, including improper storage of knives and poor housekeeping. In the case of FoodTalks Caterer & Manufacturer and Tung Lok Millennium Pte Ltd, while the causative pathogen could not be identified for both outbreaks, several food hygiene lapses were found at their premises, for example, no proper segregation between raw and ready-to-eat food in the same chiller compartment, no provision of hand washing facilities, and cockroach infestation. For the case at Mandarin Orchard Hotel, the outbreak was caused by environmental contamination of the Grand Ballroom with norovirus – a common virus that causes gastroenteritis, which was propagated by poor environmental and personal hygiene practices such as improper cleaning of vomitus and banquet servers continuing to work while ill.NEA has taken tough actions against the food operators who have violated the law. The operating licence of Spize Restaurant at River Valley Road was terminated and NEA will also press charges against the operator in Court. The operating licences of Tung Lok, as well as the ballroom and affected kitchen in Mandarin Hotel, will remain suspended until the operators have complied with the requirements imposed by NEA, which includes sanitising the affected areas, reviewing the processes and rectifying the lapses. For the lapses found at FoodTalks, NEA will be issuing summons to the operator. For selling food that is found unfit for human consumption, operators may face a penalty of up to $10,000 for the first offence, and in the case of repeat offenders, a fine of $20,000 or imprisonment of 3 months or both.In addition to strengthening the overall regulatory framework for food operators, NEA will enhance NEA's website and the myENV app to make it easier for consumers to check the food hygiene records of the operators. We are also looking into measures to better notify the public about a food operator's licence suspension. Consumers are urged to engage only licensed caterers, and consume catered food within the stipulated 'consume by' time period. Consumers who come across poor hygiene practices in food establishments should provide feedback to the authorities for further investigation.\"},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: In the last 12 months (between November 2017 and October 2018), foreign registered vehicles made about 24 million trips into Singapore through land checkpoints, or about 2 million trips per month. About 78% are made by motorcycles, 15% by cars and the remainder by goods vehicles, buses and taxis. To ensure compliance with the Environmental Protection and Management (Vehicular Emissions) Regulations, the National Environment Agency (\"NEA\") enforces against smoky foreign vehicles at the Tuas and Woodlands entry checkpoints. Notices of composition are issued on the spot if foreign vehicles fail the smoke emissions test. Foreign commercial vehicles emitting excessive smoke will also be turned back immediately. In addition, NEA works with the Land Transport Authority (\"LTA\") and the Traffic Police (\"TP\") to enforce against noisy foreign vehicles during joint blitzes. We will continue to look at measures to reduce emissions from foreign vehicles. Members of public who spot smoky or noisy vehicles on the road are encouraged to report them to NEA via the online feedback form at: www.nea.gov.sg, myENV application or the NEA hotline.'},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The National Environment Agency (NEA) monitors and reports the air quality in Singapore through a network of five national air quality monitoring stations across the island. These stations are representative of the ambient air quality of the five regions, within which the civil and military airports are located. Criteria pollutants, namely, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, ozone, particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), are continuously monitored and reported on an hourly basis as the Pollutants Standard Index (PSI). In 2018, the air quality in Singapore remained in the 'Good' and 'Moderate' range for 100% of the days, based on Singapore's PSI readings. The PSI reading is made available every hour on the NEA and haze websites, as well as on myENV app. Additionally, NEA continuously monitors the ambient concentration of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC), which are typically emitted by the industries. The VOC levels monitored in Singapore are comparable with the major EU, Japan and US cities.\"},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Desmond Lee: Based on the 2016 Marriage and Parenthood Survey, 83% of Singaporeans aged 21 to 35 who are single aspire to get married. The Government will continue to support their marriage aspirations. Most singles prefer meeting potential partners in natural settings, such as at recreational or social activities, or through introductions by friends and colleagues. We have therefore been working with partner agencies to identify natural settings for singles to meet, grow their social networks and form meaningful relationships. These include events such as Sports Hub\\'s \\'Community Play Day\\' and the Urban Redevelopment Authority’s \\'Countdown@Civic District\\'. The Social Development Network, or SDN, funds initiatives by community partners and organisations to bring singles together. SDN also helps dating agencies improve their services through accreditation and funding. To provide more interaction opportunities through interest- and activity-based initiatives, SDN organises the Spark Connections campaign twice a year, where accredited agencies offer a wide array of events and programmes at subsidised prices, ranging from trendy, lifestyle based events to self-development workshops.We also recognise that many couples aspire to have a home of their own when they get married. We have stepped up our efforts to make it faster and easier for young couples who have decided to settle down to apply for a flat. Since 2015, HDB has launched more than 50,000 new Build-To-Order (BTO) flats, with at least 70% to 85% of these set aside for first-timer families. First-timer families applying for a BTO flat in non-mature estates will be able to select a flat within two to three tries. HDB also launched the first batch of 1,100 BTO flats with shorter waiting times of about 2 to 3 years in 2018, with another 2,000 such flats scheduled for launch in 2019. We have also enhanced housing grants for resale flats, to better support couples who choose to buy resale flats. HDB has also introduced flexibility in 2018 to allow young couples who are studying or serving NS to defer their income assessment for housing loans and grants till before keys collection, instead of at the point of flat application, when they may not have met the minimum period of employment to qualify for housing grants.Besides helping singles find suitable partners, we must also continue to strengthen and support marriages. MSF works closely with our partners to offer marriage preparation programmes to couples of all ages. These programmes help couples better understand their roles and manage their expectations of married life. The programmes also equip them with useful communication and conflict resolution skills. Tailored programmes are also available for couples with specific needs, such as cross-cultural and remarrying couples.Couples who marry at a very young age may need more support to prepare for marriage. They may also face additional stress if they become parents shortly after marriage, increasing the risk of marital conflict. Hence, we have recently made it mandatory for couples where either party is a minor (below 21 years old) to undergo marriage preparation programmes before they can apply for marriage. This applies for both civil and Muslim marriages. These programmes include group marriage education workshops that equip couples with skills and knowledge on topics such as communication, conflict resolution and management of household finances, and one-to-one consultation sessions to help couples make informed decisions about marriage. There are also optional post-marriage programmes to provide continued support for couples in areas such as marriage enrichment and parenting.Marriage is hard work and the relationship needs to be constantly nurtured. We work with partners such as the Families for Life Council and family life and marriage educators to provide a suite of marriage enrichment programmes at workplaces and in the community, to equip couples with insights and tips to strengthen their marriages. The Families for Life Council also organises an annual \"I Still Do\" initiative, where there are marriage talks, bonding activities and online content to engage couples in conversations on marriage, and encourage couples to continue to date and reaffirm their commitment to each other.

       "  'answer': \"Mrs Josephine Teo: The Progressive Wage Model (PWM) was implemented in the Cleaning, Security and Landscape sectors as a targeted intervention to address low and stagnant wages caused by market failure of cheap sourcing. It aims to raise the salaries of local workers in these sectors by providing a clear progression ladder for workers to earn higher and sustainable wages as they become more skilled, more productive and take on higher job responsibilities.The number of local workers employed in these three sectors depends on many factors beyond PWM itself, such as the state of the economy, adoption of labour saving technologies, improvements to company's business processes, and changes in foreign worker (FW) policies. It is difficult to attribute changes to local employment numbers to the PWM alone.What is clear, however, is that since the PWM was implemented, workers in these three sectors have seen positive real wage growth. Between 2011 and 2016, the real median gross wages of full-time resident cleaners, security guards and landscape maintenance employees increased by 32%, 36% and 16% respectively. This was achieved while keeping local unemployment rate low at around 3% and maintaining employment rate1 at a healthy level of around 80%.\"},\n",

MSF works closely with the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Health and other agencies to support our children and youth in their mental well-being. For instance, MSF was part of the NurtureSG Taskforce that made recommendations to improve the health outcomes of our children and youth, including their mental well-being.In schools, the Character and Citizenship Education curriculum aims to raise awareness of mental health, reduce stigmatisation associated with mental health issues, help both staff and students to recognise signs of distress, for example, unexplained injuries, sending or posting moody messages online, and encourage them to seek help for themselves and others around them. Students are also taught to look out for and support one another, and to alert their teachers, school counsellors or parents if their friends are affected by difficulties. School counsellors may refer children with psycho-social issues to mental health professionals.Family members and members of the community can also play a role to spot students with depression symptoms. For example, members of the community may encourage individuals or families in need to approach a Family Service Centre (FSC) for assistance. The social workers at the FSCs will work with the school and other specialists in the community to provide holistic interventions to the student and his/her family to overcome their issues and support them towards long-term stability.\"},\n",

The investigation revealed that attempts were made with more than 27,000 email addresses. 98% of the email addresses used were not related to HealthHub account IDs, and these attempts were unsuccessful. Nevertheless, 72 accounts were successfully accessed during the four days.The high volume of email addresses not related to HealthHub account IDs and the repeated attempts suggest that the email addresses used were likely to have been obtained from other compromised sources. No evidence of a breach in the HealthHub system has been found.The unusual log-in attempts and access were limited to the basic tier of HealthHub, which contained the user's self-populated profile and any Healthpoints accumulated through participation in HPB programmes.

       "  'answer': \"Dr Ng Eng Hen: As a military with physical demands required to fulfil its mission, officers and other ranks of personnel within the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) do not adhere to the retirement age of commercial companies and civilian organisations. Most officers and warrant officers retire around 50 years old as there are only limited vocations for re-employment across the SAF. Military experts can work till 60 years of age. However, the shorter career spans within the SAF is made up by higher remuneration packages as compared to equivalent civilian jobs.  In addition, the SAF has specific programmes to prepare personnel for their second careers. 80% secure jobs within six months of retiring from the SAF. These programmes include structured training to prepare them for leadership and management roles and other valuable competencies in areas such as human resource, finance, operations research and training pedagogy. Our training programmes are accredited by external agencies, and in some cases developed jointly with local educational institutions.

       "  'answer': 'Mr Gan Kim Yong: Foreign domestic workers (FDWs) applying to work in Singapore are required to be screened for active TB, including having a chest x-ray, within two weeks of their arrival in Singapore, before they are issued with work permits. FDWs are also required to undergo screening for active TB upon two years of stay in Singapore.From 2013 to 2017, an average of 146 new FDW applicants a year were diagnosed with active TB when they applied for work permit. FDW applicants found to have active TB will not be issued work permits and have to return to their home countries, unless otherwise supported by their prospective employers. In the same period, about 200 FDW work permit holders were diagnosed with active TB per year, out of a FDW population of between 214,500 and 246,800.As active TB can still develop later after screening is negative, it is imperative that persons who display symptoms of active TB, such as unexplained prolonged cough of three weeks or more, seek early medical attention, so that active TB can be detected and treated early. With treatment, persons with active TB rapidly become non-infectious, and would no longer transmit the disease. Strict adherence to TB treatment will help ensure cure and minimise the risk of relapse of the disease.Therefore, to reduce the risk of TB transmission, we seek the support of employers with FDWs displaying TB symptoms to seek medical attention for their FDWs early. Employers should also support and ensure that their FDWs receive TB treatment, via Directly Observed Treatment (DOT), and comply with medical appointments.'},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The objective of publishing fee benchmarks is to provide all stakeholders a reference on the reasonable ranges of professional fees for common surgical procedures in the private sector. The benchmarks will guide private sector healthcare providers in charging appropriately. They will also enable patients and payers to make more informed decisions.Doctors should take reference from the benchmarks in setting their fees and advising their patients. They should also be prepared to explain to patients where their charges exceed the range, such as when addressing a highly complex case or in exceptional circumstances.Today, MOH already monitors overall hospital bill sizes and doctors' charges. Where we observe charging patterns that could be of concern, we will query the healthcare providers, investigate and take follow up actions if necessary.MOH welcomes feedback on the fee benchmarks. These would help to guide future review and refinement of the benchmarks.\"},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): The Government takes the issue of our low total fertility rate (TFR) seriously. While marriage and parenthood are ultimately personal decisions, a persistently low TFR can have far-reaching implications on our economy and our society. The decline in our TFR in recent years is in part due to a demographic shift. A relatively large cohort of young Singaporeans, many of whom are children of “baby boomers”, are just entering the peak childbearing ages of 25-39. Many of these “echo baby boomers” are not yet married or have not yet started having children. This is consistent with our survey results, which show that while the vast majority of young Singaporeans want to marry and have children, they often have other life goals as well. Some decide to delay marriage and parenthood, in order to fulfil other aspirations like establishing a career or travelling the world first.1 Whether or not they eventually marry or have children will have a significant impact on our TFR. Therefore, we must continue to support young Singaporeans and families to achieve their marriage and parenthood aspirations. In formulating our policies, we have studied the experiences of different countries (including the United Kingdom (UK), Germany, France, Denmark and East Asian countries such as South Korea). The elements that have made a real difference in raising birth rates include: (a) support for work-life through adequate parental leave, childcare and flexible work arrangements; (b) societal norms that embrace children and families, and encourage shared parental responsibility in raising children; and (c) support to defray the costs of raising children. Singapore’s marriage and parenthood policies aim to provide support in similar areas. We have invested significant resources and progressively enhanced the Marriage and Parenthood (M&P) Package over the past 17 years to provide support at each stage of the marriage and parenthood journey. To enable parents to better manage their work and family responsibilities, we have enhanced parental leave measures and strengthened support for childcare and flexible work arrangements:(a)  On parental leave, today, working couples can take up to 20 weeks of paid parental leave and two weeks of unpaid leave in their child’s first year.(b)  On childcare, the Government is committed to ensuring that every parent who wants a preschool place for their child will be able to have one, to give parents peace of mind that their children are well taken care of. ECDA has been steadily enhancing the provision of affordable and quality infant and childcare, with 40,000 more places to be added in the next five years. ECDA is also reviewing the preschool subsidy framework to improve affordability for parents.(c)  We also encourage companies to adopt family-friendly practices such as flexible work arrangements and have launched the enhanced Work-Life Grant earlier this year, as well as a Tripartite Standard on Flexible Work Arrangements in 2017, to support companies in doing so. To foster a stronger culture of shared parental responsibility, we have improved leave support for fathers to play a more active role in caring for their children. Last year, we made the second week of Paternity Leave mandatory, and increased Shared Parental Leave from one to four weeks. In total, fathers can take up to eight weeks of leave in the child’s first year.  We have also enhanced our policies to address concerns about costs of raising children. From the Baby Bonus Cash Gift, Child Development Account (CDA) and MediSave Grant for Newborns, parents can receive up to $18,000 per child for the first and second child, $26,000 per child for the third and fourth child, and $32,000 per child for the fifth and subsequent child. We also understand that many couples aspire to own their homes before they start a family. HDB has worked to provide couples with faster access to housing. Last week, it launched the first batch of 1,100 Build-To-Order (BTO) flats with shorter waiting times of two to three years from point of application. Another batch of 2,000 such flats will be launched in 2019. HDB has also introduced a new flexibility earlier this year to allow deferment of income assessment for housing loans and grants till before keys collection, for young couples who are studying or, in the case of the male, serving National Service.Together with our heavily subsidised education, public housing, and healthcare systems, these measures in our M&P Package seek to provide strong support for those who decide to marry and have children. We will continue to study ways to better strengthen this support. We are mindful that no silver bullet or single policy intervention alone will boost birth rates. As the experiences of other East Asian societies (e.g. South Korea) have shown, encouraging couples to have children requires more than a package of support measures. For a decisive increase in our TFR over the longer term, mindset shifts among couples and the support of the whole of society are critical. We must continue to encourage young Singaporeans not just to value but to prioritise marriage and parenthood as important life goals.  As employers and co-workers, we can foster more progressive workplace cultures where employees, including young parents with caregiving needs, are supported in managing their work and family responsibilities. As a community, we can extend a helping hand or word of encouragement to young Singaporeans as they navigate through their marriage and parenthood journey. It is with such collective efforts from the whole of society that we can build a more family-friendly environment where marriage and parenthood are Achievable, Enjoyable and Celebrated.'},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): Singaporeans have a growing range of e-payment options available to them. Besides PayNow, debit cards and credit cards, stored value facilities in the form of e-wallets are gaining popularity.Currently, MAS requires entities who hold a stored value float in excess of S$30 million in these stored value facilities to safeguard the float with a bank licensed by MAS.1Consumers will enjoy better protection of their funds held in stored value under the Payment Services Bill (“PSB”) that is being introduced in Parliament today. It contains two key enhancements.First, more types of stored value, or e-money, will be protected under the PSB. E-money will include not just pre-payment for goods and services such as value stored in transport cards, but also any monetary value that is held for future payment transfers between individuals. This means that the value held in e-wallets that people use to pay merchants or pay each other will also be protected in future.Second, the threshold of e-money that will be protected under the PSB will be lowered from S$30 million to S$5 million. This means that any e-money held by a payment institution will be wholly safeguarded if the average daily float exceeds S$5 million.2 If the average daily float does not exceed S$5 million, the safeguarding measures will not apply, provided the payment institution makes appropriate disclosures to consumers.We have sought to protect consumer interests while encouraging innovation in e-payments and ensuring Singapore’s competitiveness as a payment services hub. This requires that our regulations are proportionate to the risks. To give payment institutions adequate flexibility, MAS will expand the options for safeguarding measures available to Major Payment Institutions, beyond the current requirement of a bank guarantee. Under the PSB, a guarantee given by a prescribed financial institution or segregation of customer monies in a bank account will be recognised as alternative safeguarding measures.3 These two key enhancements on the scope of e-money and options for safeguarding measures are similar to those in Australia, Hong Kong, and the United Kingdom.To complement the measures in the PSB and existing regulations on banking services, MAS has issued the E-Payments User Protection Guidelines (the “Guidelines”). The Guidelines essentially aim to enhance consumer confidence in e-payments. Financial institutions and e-payment users can look to the Guidelines for (a) their respective responsibilities for ensuring secure e-payment transactions; (b) how liability for unauthorised transactions ought to be apportioned; and (c) simplified error resolution processes when a user sends money to the wrong recipient. The Guidelines were finalised in September after MAS’ public consultation earlier this year. They will take effect in January next year.MAS will continue to engage both the industry and the public as the e-payments landscape evolves, so that we provide assurance to users without holding back innovations that enhance competition and efficiency in payment services.'},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The Land Transport Authority (LTA) requires new vehicle types to be put through a robust type approval regime to ensure that they comply with internationally recognised vehicle safety standards, before they can be allowed for use on our roads. LTA also requires all in-use vehicles to be inspected regularly at LTA-authorised Inspection Centres to ensure that they are roadworthy. These inspections cover key vehicle components and systems, such as brakes, steering, tyres and exhaust systems. Besides these regular inspections, LTA and the Traffic Police also call up vehicles for ad-hoc inspections to evaluate their safety and roadworthiness. Vehicles which fail these inspections are not allowed to be used on our roads. Taxis, buses and heavy vehicles are generally subject to more stringent requirements. For example, only new vehicles are allowed to be registered as taxis, and LTA has stringent safety standards when purchasing new public buses. Taxis and public buses are also required to go for vehicular inspections more frequently, and are subject to statutory lifespans of 8 and 17 years respectively. Separately, when a vehicle model is recalled, LTA requires motor dealers and importers to notify LTA and affected vehicle owners promptly, and arrange with owners to rectify the affected vehicles. It is an offence for motor dealers and importers to not comply with this requirement.

This will ensure that car mechanics in Singapore continue to have relevant skills in light of changing technologies. SMWA is also planning to enhance local EV diagnostic, repair and maintenance capabilities. This will be achieved through hosting German specialists to train local mechanics, and organising overseas attachment programmes for more advanced training. Workforce Singapore will be providing funding support for this initiative under the Capability Transfer Programme. Autonomous Vehicle (AV) technology is nascent and mainstream adoption of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is still some time away.

       "  'answer': 'Mr Lawrence Wong: About 80% of HDB flat buyers in 2017 used CPF monies to service their loans.  These buyers are covered under CPF Board’s policy which mandates compulsory take-up of the Home Protection Scheme (HPS) for those who use CPF monies to repay any instalment of a housing loan taken to buy an HDB flat.  An additional 12% of recent flat buyers used cash to service their loans and took up HPS voluntarily.  Effectively this means that around 92% of recent HDB flat buyers with outstanding loans are covered under the HPS policy, or have voluntarily taken up HPS.  Besides HPS, some home buyers may have purchased mortgage-reducing insurance (MRI) products from the private sector.  We do not have detailed records of such purchases, but many commercial banks offer such MRI products as part of their loan financing package to home buyers.  So the overall insurance coverage may well be higher. HDB will continue to work with the CPF Board to further encourage voluntary take-up of HPS.  For example, besides conducting regular informational talks and distributing HPS booklets to home buyers, HDB will also explain to all flat buyers the benefits and coverage of HPS at the point of flat purchase.

This ensures that hawker centres are well-maintained, to provide patrons and hawkers with a pleasant and hygienic cooking and dining environment.R&R works are typically completed within two to three months, depending on the scope of works and size of the hawker centre. In planning for such works, NEA will seek feedback from the Hawkers Association and stallholders on the preferred closure periods, so that stallholders have ample advance notice and can make their plans accordingly. We also work with contractors to plan for the shortest possible closure period to enable stallholders to resume their businesses as soon as possible.'},\n",

Out of these, approximately 40%, or 2,000 transactions, involved sale by Singaporeans owning only one residential property. The SSD is intended to discourage short-term holding of residential properties, and is part of the Government’s measures to ensure a stable and sustainable property market.

In particular, the grant quantum for the Additional CPF Housing Grant and Special CPF Housing Grant is tiered based on monthly household income, while the quantum for the CPF Housing Grant is tiered by flat type.  With regard to housing loan, HDB determines the loan quantum based on the flat owners’ income as they are ones who are borrowing and need to service the mortgage.

       "  'answer': 'Mr K Shanmugam: The Registry of Moneylenders received no public feedback on foreign domestic workers (FDWs) borrowing from licensed moneylenders prior to 2017. The Registry received 1 case of feedback in 2017 and 38 cases of feedback in the first half of 2018. This reflects an increase in the number of foreign domestic workers who borrowed from licensed moneylenders from 1,500 in 2016, to 12,000 in 2017, and to 28,000 in the first half of 2018.The Police have observed more foreigners residing in Singapore, including foreign domestic workers, borrowing from unlicensed moneylenders. The Police have also seen an increase in reports of harassment from unlicensed moneylenders arising from foreign domestic workers who took loans or acted as guarantors. From 2008 to 2012, the Police registered no such reports, while 2013 to September 2018 saw about 460 of such reports. Any employer who is harassed by unlicensed moneylenders should report such activities to the Police. The Police adopt a tough enforcement stance against unlicensed moneylenders and anyone who assists them in perpetuating illicit activities. The Police and the Attorney General’s Chambers have prosecuted errant debt collectors who have violated the law, and will continue to take strong enforcement action against such conduct. Enhancing Borrower Protections There are currently several measures to protect all individuals who borrow from licensed moneylenders. For example, the Moneylenders Rules permit a licensed moneylender to charge only the following for each loan:(a)    An upfront administrative fee of up to 10%;(b)    Interest of up to 4% per month;(c)    Late interest of up to 4% per month; and(d)    Late fees of up to $60 per month.The Registrar of Moneylenders have issued Directions to regulate moneylenders’ activities. In particular, moneylenders are prohibited from advertising their loans to members of the public via mobile text messages or emails. Moneylenders are also prohibited from conducting abusive practices such as repeatedly “rolling over” existing loans to charge the administrative fee multiple times even though no new credit is issued; or offering split loans so that late fees can be charged multiple times a month.In view of the recent increase in foreigners borrowing from moneylenders, on 4 October 2018, the Ministry of Law announced two measures to strengthen protections for foreign domestic workers and other foreigners residing in Singapore from the effects of over-borrowing.First, the Ministry will impose aggregate loan caps to limit the total amount that any foreigner residing in Singapore can borrow from licensed moneylenders. The caps were first announced for Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents under the Moneylenders (Amendment) Bill in January this year:(a)    Individuals earning less than $20,000 a year may borrow up to $3,000; and(b)    Individuals earning $20,000 or more a year may borrow up to six times of monthly income.Both caps will be extended to all foreigners residing in Singapore. In addition, there will be a lower cap of $1,500 for all foreigners residing in Singapore who earn less than $10,000 annually.Second, the Ministry will introduce a self-exclusion framework for all individuals who borrow from licensed moneylenders. Both Singapore residents and foreigners may apply for self-exclusion. Licensed moneylenders will be prohibited from lending to self-excluded individuals.This framework will help individuals to control their borrowing habits, and to participate in debt assistance schemes administered by voluntary welfare organisations which typically require self-exclusion.Third, on unlicensed moneylenders, the Ministry of Manpower has announced that it will take administrative actions against work pass holders who borrow from unlicensed moneylenders. When a work pass holder is found to have borrowed from unlicensed moneylenders, the Ministry of Manpower will inform the employer and revoke the work pass. The worker will then be repatriated and debarred from further employment in Singapore.The Ministry of Manpower will implement this measure against borrowing from unlicensed moneylenders in 2019, after a period of education and communication. The Ministry of Manpower will continue to step up educational efforts on money management and the risks of borrowing from moneylenders, for work pass holders and their employers.These measures will be complemented by existing support channels for work pass holders, such as voluntary welfare organisations, the Migrant Workers’ Centre, and the Centre for Domestic Employees.The Ministry of Law, together with the Ministry of Manpower and the Singapore Police Force, will continue to monitor the situation closely following the implementation of these measures, and will assess if more stringent measures are necessary.'},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Dr Ng Eng Hen: MINDEF’s compensation framework tracks the amounts prescribed by the Work Injury Compensation Act (WICA) but would be generally higher in recognition of the risks borne by our servicemen during military training and operations. For deaths that result from military training or operations, the compensation amount is doubled that of WICA. On top of this, additional compensation may be granted if there are exceptional circumstances or when the serviceman had rendered service beyond the call of duty. Overall, the total compensation amounts disbursed for incidents arising from training and operations are generally two to four times that of amounts provided under the national compensation framework. The SAF also provides welfare support through grants disbursed from the SAF Benevolent Fund. These grants are used to meet the immediate needs of the families of servicemen who have passed away as well as provide financial assistance to help the serviceman’s family, depending on the family’s circumstances. Over and above the existing compensation and welfare provisions, MINDEF provides our servicemen with $150,000 of Group Term Life (GTL) and $150,000 of Group Personal Accident (GPA) insurance under the MINDEF/SAF Group Insurance Core Scheme. The premiums for these insurance are paid by MINDEF, in recognition of our servicemen’s contribution to national defence and security, and to strengthen our care for them.The Member has also asked how SAF intends to prevent further training accidents.

Offenders can face a jail term of up to 10 years, and a fine. The Government is also studying ways to strengthen our laws against cheating offences. The Penal Code Review Committee has made recommendations in this area, which the Government is studying. Besides having strong punishments as deterrence, the Police have also taken steps to educate the elderly. For example, the Police work with the Residents’ Committees and grassroots volunteers to spread scam alert messages to residents, through community events like block parties, roadshows, festive events and Community Safety & Security Programmes (CSSPs). One such CSSP focusing on the elderly is the Silver Watch Group. Launched in 2013, the initiative aims to impart elderly residents with crime prevention knowledge by keeping them informed of the latest crime situation and encouraging them to share the relevant advice with their peers. The Police have also worked with banks and remittance centres to identify potential victims and advise them to exercise caution when transferring money to unknown bank accounts. To increase public awareness, the Police have also put up anti-scam advisories near to ATM and AXS machines.

It allows users to access information about dementia and the available support services, receive updates on upcoming events on caregiving, and most importantly, enlist the help of the community to locate loved ones who might be lost. When persons with dementia are lost, caregivers can use the mobile app to activate the network of Dementia Friends.  These Dementia Friends who are members of the public would then receive a notification from the mobile app to help keep a look out for the lost persons.  Go-to Points are listed in the mobile app, so that the persons who are lost can be brought to the nearest Go-to Point by nearby Dementia Friends to be reunited with their caregivers.

       "  'answer': 'Mrs Josephine Teo: As at the end of 2017, there were 91,700 Work Permit Holders granted R1 (Skilled) status on account of their skills or years of experience, and meeting a minimum salary criterion.As part of the application for or renewal of Work Permits, employers are required to declare that the indicated salary is true, and they are warned that failure to pay the declared salary or providing false information is an offence. MOM conducts random inspections to detect non-compliance. In addition, when foreign workers lodge complaints of underpayment of salary or kickbacks, MOM also investigates the employer for making a false declaration in their application.In 2017, 61 employers were investigated for falsely declaring the salary in a Work Permit application involving the R1 qualifying routes raised by the Member. Of these, 18 employers were either prosecuted or issued with an Administrative Financial Penalty. Their work pass privileges were also suspended.All employers are already required by law to pay their foreign workers through electronic means if the worker requests for it. The Migrant Workers’ Centre is stepping up education efforts to encourage workers to make such requests. They are also making arrangements to help foreign workers to open bank accounts. In addition, as earlier announced, MOM is consulting with stakeholders on the further step of making electronic payments of salaries mandatory for all Work Permit Holders.'},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr S Iswaran: Currently, some websites and online platforms track their users’ behaviour by collecting data on their browsing habits and activities, and use the data to serve targeted advertisements or improve browsing experiences.Organisations should ensure that their collection, use and disclosure of users’ behavioural data comply with the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (PDPA). In the event of a complaint, the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) will investigate and take enforcement action if it assesses that there is a breach of the PDPA.As Singapore’s Digital Economy develops, we envisage that businesses will increasingly leverage such data to offer better, more innovative products and services that are tailored to their users’ preferences. At the same time, we recognise public concerns over the widespread collection of personal data by online platforms, and the potential misuse of such data.There are tools and mechanisms already available today that provide a balanced and effective approach to prevent the unwanted tracking of individuals. For example, individuals who are concerned with tracking may block and delete cookies, or use plugins and browser extensions to prevent websites from profiling them. They may also request not to be tracked when browsing a website. Most modern browsers come with such functionalities. The Media Literacy Council also provides tips on basic ways in which users can guard against online tracking.MCI and PDPC will continue to monitor developments on this issue, and ensure that our policies continue to safeguard individuals’ interests while allowing data-driven innovation in the Digital Economy.'},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Desmond Lee: ComCare is part of the multiple layers of assistance provided by the Government to support low-income individuals and families. Other programmes include Workfare, medical and education subsidies, and housing assistance. Households that require help to tide over periods of difficulty are provided Short-to-Medium-Term Assistance (SMTA), which provides financial assistance for daily living expenses, help with household bills, and other forms of support such as referrals to Workforce Singapore’s Careers Connect for employment assistance or to Family Service Centres for casework and counselling.SSOs keep track of clients’ situations while they are receiving ComCare assistance. Those who have gained employment while on ComCare assistance may still receive assistance for a period of time, as they work towards financial stability in their new jobs. SSOs may also continue to provide assistance if their clients’ incomes from work are assessed to be insufficient for their household living expenses (e.g. those who are in part-time jobs).There are various reasons why clients reapply for assistance, such as when they face new challenges in their family, work, or health circumstances.

       "  'answer': 'Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB already provides a rent transition period to public rental tenants when their income increases. Households with monthly income below $800 pay the lowest rent tier which starts at $26 for a 1-room flat, or $44 for a 2-room flat. At tenancy renewal, HDB waives the rent increase for one tenancy term1 if the household’s income crosses the $800 threshold but remains within the income ceiling of $1,500. At the subsequent tenancy renewal, even if the household’s income increases further, HDB will waive the rent increase for another tenancy term if the increase in income is low relative to the rent increase and the household remains within the income ceiling. HDB works closely with Social Service Offices to support families placed on ComCare schemes under the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF).  For households receiving Short-to-Medium Term Assistance (SMTA), HDB will determine the rent payable based on an individual assessment of their financial situation. Those receiving ComCare Long Term Assistance will automatically qualify for the lowest rent tier.'},\n",

These volunteers include ex-patients, members of the public, students and even staff, who do so out of their passion to serve.Our PHIs regularly review their volunteer management practices to incorporate new ideas where feasible and appropriate. Whilst the concept of time-banking is an interesting one, it is important to ensure that we do not inadvertently crowd out the intrinsic motivation of our volunteers to serve others. Our PHIs show recognition and appreciation for our volunteers through various initiatives, such as annual volunteer celebrations, training to develop leadership and patient interaction skills, and recognition awards.

To enhance safety, the Land Transport Authority (\"LTA\") has put in place warning signs such as \"Pedestrian Crossing Ahead\", zig-zag lines and flashing beacons near the crossings, so that motorists are more alert as they approach.

As of mid-September 2018, more than 30% of Jurong households have switched to a retailer.To better understand the public's reception towards the OEM soft launch, EMA conducted a survey involving the Jurong residents about three months after the soft launch started. The survey results showed that the Jurong residents generally felt positive about the OEM, with very high awareness of the OEM and their electricity purchase options. About nine in 10 of the survey respondents indicated that they were aware of the OEM and the electricity purchase options available to them. Of those who had switched to a retailer, about eight in 10 appreciated the benefits of the OEM and indicated that they found the switching process easy.A small number of residents highlighted that they experienced higher electricity bills after switching to a retailer. There are a few possible explanations:(a) SP Group reads electricity meters once every two months. On alternate months when the meters are not read, the consumer’s bill is based on estimated consumption. Any underestimated readings will be carried over to the next bill, which would make the next bill higher.(b) Depending on when a consumer switched, his first bill may not cover a full month. The following month's bill will be relatively higher as it will cover a full month of electricity consumption.(c) Another possible reason for higher electricity bills is that electricity usage could be higher during certain periods of the year, for example, school holidays or hotter months of the year.With the zonal rollout of OEM starting from 1 November 2018, EMA will continue to ensure that the necessary safeguards are in place to protect consumers. EMA will also continue to work closely with SP Group and the retailers to inform and educate consumers about the OEM.\"},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Since 2004, PUB has progressively opened up its reservoirs and waterways for water sports and activities such as kayaking, dragon boating and fishing under the Active, Beautiful and Clean (ABC) Waters Programme. This is to bring the community closer to water, so that they can better cherish and appreciate this precious resource.Today, the public can fish at designated areas within 10 reservoirs and five waterways such as Kolam Ayer ABC Waterfront, Geylang River, Rochor Canal, Bedok Reservoir, Lower Seletar Reservoir and Pandan Reservoir. The full list can be found on PUB's website. Popular fishing locations such as Bedok Reservoir, Pandan Reservoir and Kolam Ayer ABC Waterfront are frequented by recreational users, including families and anglers, especially on weekends. The designated fishing areas are located a safe distance away from water activity zones, footpaths and park connectors. As reservoirs are key sources of water supply, ensuring the water quality in our reservoirs is of utmost importance. Nevertheless, PUB will continue to assess and open up suitable new sites for water sports and activities. Exercising a little consideration goes a long way in making our reservoirs and waterways a safe and pleasant environment for all to enjoy. PUB appeals to the public to adopt responsible fishing practices, such as fishing only at designated areas, casting lures with care to avoid injuring others, and discarding unwanted fishing lines and hooks properly. Members of the public are encouraged to call the PUB hotline at 1800-2255-782 should they spot any illegal and unsafe fishing activities.\"},\n",

       "  'question': 'Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether the Home Improvement Programme (HIP) can include replacements of windows for older flats and to provide aircon ledges to prevent the hazard of falling aircons for public safety; (b) how many households have opted for deferred payment instead of full settlement by cash under HIP so far; and (c) whether HDB has ensured that prospective buyers of such resale flats whose existing owner opted out of HIP is aware of this for fair sale purposes.',\n",
       "  'answer': 'Mr Lawrence Wong: Residents are responsible for regular maintenance of the windows to ensure that they are safe and secure at all times. Most residents install custom-made windows based on their preference, and these are of varying sizes, colours, different configurations and designs. It would thus be best to leave the replacement of these windows to flat owners.External air-conditioner ledges were provided in HDB flats from the early 1990s onwards. For flats without air-conditioner ledges, the Building Control Regulations stipulate that residents need to install stainless steel brackets to support any external air-conditioning units. This is to ensure public safety. There is therefore no need to provide air-conditioner ledges under HIP.As at 31 August 2018, about 90,000 households have been billed for the Home Improvement Programme (HIP). Of the households billed, 11.5% households have opted for deferred payment and 88.5% households have made full payment. Amongst those who made full payment, about half of them paid by cash.The status of flats undergoing upgrading programmes such as HIP is published on the HDB InfoWeb. Prospective flat buyers can therefore check the status of the flat they are interested in. Upon ascertaining that the flat is undergoing HIP, they would need to check with the sellers on the HIP components, that is, Essential/Optional that the sellers have opted for and factor these into their price negotiation with the sellers before committing to the purchase.'},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The 3R Fund is a co-funding scheme that supports companies to reduce waste and encourage recycling. As of July 2018, NEA has disbursed $1.4 million for 19 completed projects and committed another $2.5 million in support of 22 ongoing projects. The 3P (People, Private and Public) Partnership Fund supports ground-up environmental initiatives. Over the past three years, about $3.2 million was disbursed in support of more than 3,000 projects, with about three quarters of funding going towards waste minimisation activities. We supported the Zero Waste SG's Bring-Your-Own Campaign which has averted the use of two million pieces of plastic disposables and packaging waste. 430 retailers and F&B companies came together to encourage consumers to bring their own reusable containers, bottles and bags. We also supported F&N to work with retailers and tertiary institutions to raise awareness of recycling plastic bottles and aluminium cans.We are heartened that some food delivery companies are discouraging the overuse of plastics on their own accord.

       "  'answer': \"Mr Lawrence Wong: The property cooling measures implemented on 6 July 2018 are intended to moderate the residential property market cycle and keep price increases in line with economic fundamentals. Loan-to-Value (LTV) limits were tightened across all housing loans, including those taken by first-time buyers, as the price increases prior to the measures were broad-based across the market, reflecting demand from all types of buyers. However, we maintained Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty (ABSD) rates for Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents buying their first residential property.As the measures were only introduced recently, it is premature to conclude whether they have been effective. Nevertheless, there are early signs that the measures may have kept the pace of price increase in check. Based on URA's latest flash estimate of the Property Price Index, prices increased by 0.5% in 3Q 2018, compared to 3.9% and 3.4% in 1Q and 2Q 2018 respectively.

       "  'answer': 'Mr Lawrence Wong: Over the past 10 years (2008-2017), seven Place of Worship (PW) sites were launched and successfully awarded. In June 2012, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) relaxed the allowable Gross Plot Ratio (GPR) and storey height controls for PW developments. This has allowed for intensification of some PW sites, subject to local site conditions, and whether the proposed intensification would adversely affect surrounding uses. In September 2018, MND announced the revised tender process for PW sites to ensure that only religious groups that actively contribute to the community and have a genuine need for worship space are allowed to bid. Under the revised framework, MND will also be releasing land for PW hubs, which can house multiple religious organisations belonging to the same religion, in a multi-storey development. Smaller religious organisations who find the standard PW sites too large for their own use can band together under one PW hub. Through co-location and sharing of facilities such as car parks, Singapore’s limited land resources will be better optimised. '},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mr Chan Chun Sing: Helping Singapore companies internationalise is a key thrust of Singapore's economic strategy. ASEAN alone represents a market of USD 2.55 trillion in GDP and a population of some 650 million1. The Government supports companies' internationalisation in several ways. First, we provide targeted grant support for SMEs making their first foray into overseas markets through the Market Readiness Assistance (MRA) scheme. In 2017, 1,629 MRA grants were disbursed, which included support for SMEs expanding into regional markets like Indonesia, Myanmar, Vietnam, India and China for the first time. To help companies that have had overseas exposure but which need more tailored assistance to expand overseas or access additional overseas markets, we provide help in the form of the Global Company Partnership (GCP) programme. In 2017, the GCP which comes with a grant assisted 419 companies in the areas of capability development, market access, and manpower development for internationalisation. Of these, about 40% were for companies expanding within Southeast Asia. MTI and our agencies regularly review these grant schemes to provide more customised support to local enterprises seeking to develop new capabilities to scale up and internationalise. Second, we support businesses' efforts to develop their manpower and talent, to better understand regional markets. Examples of partnership with companies include the Youth Talent Programme which targets to send 1000 students each year for work opportunities in overseas markets, the Professional Conversion Programme for Southeast Asia Ready Talent which integrates job-matching and reskilling to help professionals gain new skills for job roles within the Southeast Asian region, and the ASEAN Leadership Programme which trains C-Suite business leaders on strategies to leverage on ASEAN’s growth. Together, these programmes help to build up groups of Singapore students and professionals with more specialised knowledge and in time, experience and networks in the Southeast Asia’s markets. Third, Enterprise Singapore (ESG)'s international network of offices and in-market partners facilitates leads and connections for companies venturing overseas. In 2017, ESG (then-International Enterprise Singapore) successfully facilitated over 450 overseas projects for Singapore companies. The Plug & Play Network, which helps SMEs access new markets by providing in-market assistance in business advisory services, business matching, and market set-up, was also launched in 2017. SMEs can now gain access to assistance in over 45 major cities across six Asian markets, including Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Ho Chi Minh City, New Delhi and Shanghai. ESG also partnered Trade Associations and Chambers to facilitate visits by about 6,000 businesses to overseas markets through business missions and participation in international trade shows. As the ASEAN Chair this year, Singapore has also worked with member countries to deepen regional connectivity and improve trade facilitation. At the recently concluded 50th ASEAN Economic Ministers Meeting, two new Agreements on services and trade facilitation were signed and an ASEAN Agreement on e-Commerce was endorsed. These agreements2  when they take effect will give Singaporean businesses greater access to ASEAN's services markets and save costs and time for Singaporean businesses by making customs procedures less burdensome. The ASEAN Agreement on e-Commerce will lower the costs for Singaporean businesses by improving the speed and reliability of supply chains in cross-border e-Commerce transactions.  The Government is firmly committed to continuing to support our companies to seize overseas opportunities and grow. \"},\n",

       "  'answer': '24 Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what is the basis for the Ministry\\'s claim that Singapore has 20% of the global market share in aircraft leasing; (b) for the eight out of the top ten aircraft leasing companies which have their operations in Singapore, how does the Ministry define \"operations\"; and (c) how many of them account for their lease income and aircraft assets in the profit and loss and balance sheets, respectively, of their Singapore entities.Mr Chan Chun Sing: Singapore\\'s competitiveness as a base for aircraft leasing companies is founded on several factors, including our extensive network of Avoidance of Double Taxation Agreements (DTAs); our strong financial industry and professional services ecosystem which provide supporting services to aircraft leasing businesses; and our established aviation and aerospace industries which complement the aircraft leasing industry with their deep knowledge and quality services. Several companies of varying sizes seeking to develop aircraft leasing capabilities in Singapore have availed themselves of the Economic Development Board (EDB)\\'s Aircraft Leasing Scheme (ALS). The ALS is just one of the ways in which the EDB works with aircraft leasing companies to capture growth opportunities for the industry, strengthen the larger ecosystem of related industries, and create good jobs for Singaporeans. While Singapore\\'s competitiveness cannot be attributed solely to our tax regime, factual details of tax regimes across jurisdictions including Ireland, Hong Kong and Singapore can be found in the respective government publications. Eight out of the top 10 aircraft leasing companies have offices in Singapore and are registered with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA). Aircraft leasing companies in Singapore may undertake activities such as sales, leasing, and financing depending on their business models. In addition, they are required to comply with accounting and tax filing requirements under Singapore law.While Singapore is generally recognised as one of the top aircraft leasing hubs alongside Ireland which is the industry leader, as reported in industrial reports and news articles, other cities in our region are also competing to capture opportunities arising from Asia\\'s increasing demand in air travel.

       "  'answer': \"Mr S Iswaran: Premium Rate Services (PRS) are value-added services delivered over mobile telecommunication networks, and include third-party services provided to mobile customers. In 2017, the Infocommunications Media Development Authority (IMDA) received 91 PRS-related complaints. These complainants generally claimed that they were charged for PRS that they did not subscribe to. IMDA's investigations revealed that these end users had actually subscribed to the PRS without reading the terms and conditions carefully.  IMDA has implemented several measures to protect consumers against accidentally subscribing to PRS. Currently, the Code of Practice for the Provision of Premium Rate Service (PRS Code) requires service providers to publish the terms and conditions of their services clearly, and confirm end-users' purchases before activating the PRS. Since 2012, IMDA has required mobile operators to offer a PRS barring service for free. Consumers who activate this service will not receive or be billed for any chargeable PRS. Since the PRS barring service was introduced, the number of PRS-related complaints has dropped by approximately 80% from 483 complaints in 2012 to 91 complaints in 2017. IMDA has also stepped up our consumer education efforts, including giving talks at events targeting seniors, distributing brochures and uploading educational videos on YouTube. Where consumers including seniors have accidentally subscribed to PRS, IMDA will also step in to engage the service provider. In several cases, the service provider has waived the subscription charges incurred on a goodwill basis, and the mobile operator has thereafter activated its PRS barring service. Nevertheless, we urge consumers to also ensure that they fully understand the terms and conditions before activating any PRS. \"},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Having sufficient, good quality sleep is an important component of a healthy lifestyle. Insufficient or poor quality sleep can lead to impaired cognition, and increased risk of health concerns such as obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and mental health issues. Insomnia, that is, difficulty sleeping and obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) are the two most common sleep-related problems that Singaporeans seek medical help for. From 2012 to 2016, the number of patients diagnosed as having insomnia at polyclinics has been stable, averaging 5,100 persons per year. The number of admissions to public hospitals for OSA increased from 3,592 in 2012 to 4,685 in 2017. They could be due to varying factors including increased awareness and more referrals. The Health Promotion Board (HPB) has various initiatives to raise awareness on the importance and benefits of adequate sleep, especially for the young. Efforts include incorporating messages in HPB's stress and psycho-emotional programmes for school children, and engaging parents through workshops to emphasise their role in inculcating good sleep habits in their children. HPB's HealthHub and a microsite also provide additional information on sleep, and tips on good sleeping habits for adults and children.

       "  'answer': \"Mr Chan Chun Sing: In general, the Government adopts a balanced approach of supporting a pro-enterprise environment and safeguarding consumers' interest. Consumers are encouraged to take steps to protect themselves before making their purchases. This would include checking the terms and conditions of contracts which they are about to enter into; what they are paying for; and the supplier’s refund policies. If consumers are unsure about any terms and conditions, they are encouraged to clarify with the suppliers. Suppliers should also be upfront and transparent with consumers about material terms and conditions in their agreements so consumers can make an informed decision.If consumers have reason to believe that the suppliers have engaged in unfair trading practices, they can approach the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) with details of these practices for CASE to assist them in seeking redress from the suppliers. The Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act protects consumers against errant retailers which engage in unfair trading practices, including attempts to conceal information or mislead consumers. Under the CPFTA, CASE can invite suppliers to cease their unfair practices through a Voluntary Compliance Agreement. The Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore, as the administering agency of the CPFTA, is also empowered with investigation and enforcement powers to take action against errant retailers who persist in unfair practices.We note the member's suggestion regarding pre-ticked boxes and will study it further, taking into account feedback from relevant stakeholders and global best practices. \"},\n",

       "  'question': 'Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Government will ban the payment of heavy vehicle drivers on a \"per trip\" basis to prevent excessive speeding or dangerous driving by the drivers.',\n",
       "  'answer': 'Mrs Josephine Teo: There were 10 fatal accidents involving heavy vehicles in the first half of 2018, a significant reduction from the 20 in the same period last year. Nonetheless, we should aim to prevent all accidents. It is not clear that banning \"per trip\" payments is the solution. The Traffic Police\\'s investigations have found that the top causes of heavy vehicle accidents are related to driver behaviour: failing to keep a proper lookout, failing to control the vehicle and reckless lane changing. In MOM\\'s investigations into heavy vehicle accidents, we found that drivers on other payment arrangements can also exhibit careless driving behaviour.The Safer Roads Industry Taskforce, comprising representatives from Government agencies, transport and logistics companies and unions, studied the issue of heavy vehicle safety. It concluded that it was more effective to enhance companies\\' ability to manage driver behaviour, and to build drivers\\' safety awareness, rather than to ban \"per trip\" payment. The Taskforce\\'s recommendations in 2016 sought to influence driver behaviour by (i) leveraging technology, (ii) expanding driver training, and (iii) strengthening company processes and systems.  To leverage technology, the Traffic Police is conducting a trial to study the suitability of speed-tracking devices for heavy vehicles. MOM has also launched a Technology Challenge to fund the development and test-bedding of devices that can improve vehicular safety. Solutions undergoing test-bedding with logistics companies include those that alert drivers of risky behaviour like speeding and tail-gating. If the trials are successful, MOM will work with relevant agencies and trade associations to promote adoption of these solutions. To expand driver training, MOM and the Traffic Police have worked with the Automobile Association of Singapore to launch a heavy vehicle vocational driver training course, subsidised by SkillsFuture Singapore. It provides refresher training on top of that given for the heavy vehicle licensing test. To improve company processes and systems, the Workplace Safety and Health Council has been educating more companies on safe driving. For instance, under the Drive Safe, Work Safe campaign launched in June 2018, more than 200 companies have pledged their commitment to prevent vehicular accidents.  '},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The Sungei Road Hawking Zone (SRHZ) was closed on 10 July 2017. Ahead of its closure, various agencies, including the National Environment Agency (NEA), Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), Workforce Singapore (WSG), and Central Singapore Community Development Council (CDC) provided SRHZ users with financial, employment and social support. These included the provision of lock-up stalls at hawker centres managed by NEA, referrals to other flea markets, financial assistance, and job placement. In September last year, we updated that the Government had engaged about 200 SRHZ users. Close to 80 received some form of assistance. Since then, the agencies have helped about 20 more former users. Hence, to date, a total of about 100 out of the 200 users have received Government assistance. Around 40 former users have taken up stalls at hawker centres, and about 30 former users have chosen to operate at other flea markets. Another 30 users have received employment and/or financial assistance. Of the 200 users who were engaged, 100 or so users have declined assistance.

MOM conducts regular surveys with FDWs. Based on the most recent survey in 2015, the proportion of FDWs reporting at least one rest day a month was 98%, compared to 53% in 2010. The percentage of FDWs with four rest days also increased to 56% from 25% in 2010. These results are consistent with a survey of FDWs conducted by the Centre for Domestic Employees in 2017, where 96% had at least one rest days a month and 60% had four rest days a month.In MOM's survey in 2015, more than 95% of FDWs indicated that their workload was either just right or they were able to handle more, which suggests that the FDWs are sufficiently well-rested to perform their tasks.

       "  'answer': 'Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB takes a needs-based approach in assisting public rental applicants and tenants, including those who are above the income ceiling. This includes taking into account their household size and expenses when assessing their requests for public rental, and their ability to pay rent. The majority of HDB public rental tenants have a household size of three or less. In addition, more than half of public rental households pay basic rents, which are $26 to $33 a month for a 1-room flat and $44 to $75 a month for a 2-room flat. The remaining households pay higher monthly rents based on their household incomes.

       "  'answer': \"Mr Gan Kim Yong: To ensure inpatient treatment remains affordable, means-tested Government subsidies of up to 80% are available to all Singaporeans at our public healthcare institutions. In addition, all Singaporeans are covered by MediShield Life which protects them against large bills, and they can utilise Medisave for the co-payment portion of their hospitalisation costs.  Currently, more than seven in 10 hospitalisations by Singaporeans aged 55 and above in the subsidised wards (B2 or C ward types) do not require any cash payment, and more than eight in 10 paid less than $100 in cash. This means that with subsidies and MediShield Life, the Medisave claim limits are generally sufficient to cover the large majority of patients' hospitalisation bills. Where the patient's financial circumstances are more challenging, MOH may also consider allowing more Medisave use on appeal. Singaporeans who require additional financial assistance can also approach medical social workers at our public healthcare institutions to apply for Medifund. We regularly review our Medisave withdrawal limits, in conjunction with subsidies and MediShield Life coverage, to ensure that good quality, basic inpatient care is affordable for all Singaporeans.

The majority of these incidents happened when the buses moved off from a stationary position or stopped abruptly to avoid vehicles cutting in. To reduce such incidents, bus operators are installing telematics systems which enable bus captains to review and improve their driving patterns, such as minimising sudden movements. To date, about 70% of public buses are equipped with telematics systems. However, it is not possible to eliminate all abrupt movements by buses.

       "  'answer': 'Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): Ms Lim asked about the adverse impact of a move towards a cashless society. We do not aim to be a completely cashless society. Cash has been with us for centuries, and will be around for quite some time more.  Electronic payments are growing in ease and convenience, and more Singaporeans are taking to e-payments every day. Today, more than 8 in 10 Singaporeans are using some form of e-payments. More than a million Singaporeans have signed on to PayNow. We want to help every segment in society to be able to use e-payments when it is convenient and beneficial to do so.  For consumers, e-payments are now a lot more convenient than cash. Payment is as simple as waving a card, a smart phone or scanning a QR code. More importantly, for the elderly, it means not having to carry cash for all their needs, and does away with many trips to the ATM. As it is, cash withdrawals at ATMs are coming down by S$300 million every year.For small businesses, accepting e-payments helps to reduce the time and effort in counting cash, reconciling money, and depositing the money in the banks. For a hawker, it means no need to handle cash as he prepares food, which also improves hygiene. It has been estimated that the cost of processing cash is about S$2 billion a year, or 0.5% of GDP in 2015. This is the amount that businesses collectively, especially small businesses, can potentially save.The supporting infrastructure for e-payments has now been developed. We have implemented FAST to facilitate real-time inter-bank account transfers. With PayNow, both individuals and companies can pay one another using their NRIC numbers or phone numbers or Unique Entity Number as the case may be. And Singapore is the first country to adopt a standardised QR Code for payments. Every merchant will just have one QR code for every e-payment scheme it decides to accept, and there will be no confusion on what QR code to scan.However, the benefits and convenience of e-payments are not fully felt yet. This is mainly because the solutions building on this infrastructure are just beginning to proliferate. The standardised SGQR is being rolled out progressively. And as more businesses sign up for PayNow Corporate, it will become easier for people to pay their bills or pay for goods and services or even hawker food by scanning a QR code using their mobile phone. The good thing about paying by QR code is that it does not need any payment accepting devices, and the entry barrier is very low.There is also the alternative of contactless payments. NETS and the major consumer banks are progressively replacing older NETS cards with newer NETS contactless bank cards in the coming months. A person just needs to wave his or her NETS contactless bank card to make a payment. This is actually the most convenient and intuitive e-payment mode for the elderly, who are already familiar with using their contactless concession cards for public transport.E-payments will for sure be more convenient over time, as the solutions to support it become more user-friendly, people gain familiarity with them, and they become pervasive.We are putting effort into educating the public to help everyone take advantage of e-payments. IMDA has launched the e-Payment Learning Journey to help seniors learn how to make digital transactions. SkillsFuture Singapore has rolled out a SkillsFuture for Digital Workplace programme to reach out to members of the public. Banks are also re-skilling branch customer service staff, to become digital banking ambassadors, to help customers enjoy the benefits of digital banking, including e-payments. In many constituencies, students are volunteering to help educate less digitally-savvy residents.  Through the collective effort of the Government, industry players and the community, we can make e-payments work for all by bringing about greater convenience and benefits.'},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Lee Hsien Loong: In light of the recent cyber-attack on SingHealth’s computer systems, the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) instructed the 11 Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) sectors to strengthen their network security, including taking the following steps:Remove all connections to unsecured external networks if there are no strong business or operational reasons to keep such connections open.If connections to unsecured external networks are required, these should ideally be mediated through uni-directional gateways, for example, data diodes to prevent data leakage.If two-way communications between the secured network and unsecured external network is required, a secured informational gateway has to be implemented, such as filters for malicious content and firewalls. The 11 CII sectors are currently conducting a review of their systems, in consultation with CSA. This process will be completed by the end of 2018.The Government will continue to review the essential security measures that CII owners must adopt. Ultimately, these security measures must strike a balance between security, operational efficiency and cost. This is a dynamic balance that will be reviewed as the threat landscape evolves. In an increasingly digital world, cybersecurity is critical to protecting business operations and strengthening trust between businesses and their customers. The Government will therefore not be providing grants or funding to CII owners to comply with cybersecurity requirements and implement such cybersecurity measures which should be borne by companies as part of normal business costs. Nevertheless, the Government and CSA will continue working closely with CII owners and businesses to strengthen their cybersecurity posture.

The Appellate High Court referred to DPM Teo\\'s Ministerial Statement given in 2006 to this House, when he was Defence Minister. That Ministerial Statement coupled with the written judgement, illuminate the fundamentals on which our NS policy are based, that we must not unwittingly weaken lest we undo this nation\\'s foundations. I urge all Members to read them. The judges opined that, \"In practical terms, what the three fundamental principles of national security, universality and equity mean is that in order to ensure Singapore\\'s national security, every male Singaporean must serve NS and at the time he is required to under the [Enlistment] Act, without regard to his personal convenience and considerations. When a person refuses to serve NS at the time that he is required to and instead returns to serve at a time of his own choosing, or worse, at an age when he can no longer serve, his actions strike at the very core of the principles of national security, universality and equity.\"4  Thirteen NS defaulters were prosecuted after the new sentencing framework was established last year. In Court, each gave reasons why he did not enlist as required. Some wanted to complete their university degree first before NS. Others said they had to support their families. In every judgement, the Courts dismiss these personal reasons, convicted and sentenced them to jail terms. Harsh as it is, the Enlistment Act is blind to \"personal convenience and considerations\"5, no matter how talented the individual or exceptional his circumstances. At the core of the Enlistment Act, the critical national need for a strong defence puts aside personal pursuits and mandates that each liable male performs his NS when required.The written judgement noted that everyone was asked to do his \"fair share\"6 – \"This entails every citizen who is required to serve NS making sacrifices or postponing individual goals to serve the nation when the nation needs his service\"7. These arguments spell out in unequivocal terms the NS obligations for every Singaporean male. Deferment therefore cannot be for that individual, no matter how talented, to pursue his own interests or career, even if it vicariously brings credit or fame to Singapore. This would be fundamentally wrong and goes against the core principle of equity.Some Singaporeans have voiced the same opinions over Mr Davis\\' application. Mr Suresh Nair, who wrote, \"Let this Davis case be the right and timely reminder of the need for absolute fairness in applying laws regarding NS deferment\".8 To preserve equity for all national servicemen, MINDEF will only defer individuals very selectively if their deferment serves Singapore\\'s interest first and foremost, never their own. This was the only basis to defer three sportsmen, swimmers Joseph Schooling and Quah Zheng Wen, and sailor Maximilian Soh, from NS to train and compete in the Olympics. The sportsmen deferred know this, as clear expectations were laid out when deferment was given, in discussion with the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY) on the standards required for their training. Neither was deferment open-ended nor unconditional. They will have to return to serve NS, and if they do not meet the standards agreed upon, deferment will be curtailed. These strict conditions are necessary because even for these individuals who can bring glory to Singapore, there are detractors, who think it’s unfair for anyone to be deferred. Mr T Ng wrote to MINDEF – \"Please be fair to all Singaporean males, who spent years serving NS. Every Singaporean male\\'s career is important from his own point of view.\"9  Disruption for individuals after they are enlisted for NS follows the same principles and is also given only for national reasons. We disrupt medical students to complete their medical studies because we need them to serve as Medical Officers during their NS to take care of their fellow soldiers. It’s not an entitlement and once the reasons are no longer valid, the disruption will end. For example, we previously allowed overseas medical students to disrupt, but this was stopped in 1992, when we could produce enough doctors locally. Similarly, dental students were not disrupted after 1989, as there was no need for NS Dental Officers. For transparency, MINDEF publishes a full list of all medical students who are disrupted every year.Having stated the general principles, let me explain why the application by Mr Harvey Davis for his son\\'s deferment was rejected even though MINDEF recognised Mr Ben Davis\\' achievement in obtaining a senior contract with Fulham Football Club (FC).First, Mr Ben Davis is playing for Fulham FC as an English national, not a Singapore citizen. MINDEF is not privy to the contract signed between them, but we assume this published information is correct and that the father must have his reasons for doing so.Second, Mr Harvey Davis has consistently refused to indicate when his son would return to serve NS, if deferred. The father replied to MCCY, Sport Singapore (SportSG) and Football Association of Singapore (FAS), stating – \"We are unable to commit to a date for his return should he be playing professional football in the UK or Europe. In addition, it is also a possibility that Ben could be offered a new two-year contract in 2019 after the first year of his pro-contract just like he has been offered a new two-year pro contract half way through his two-year scholarship contract. Or, he could be sent out on loan or sold to another club. There are a lot of variables all dependent on his development and progression.”10  Third, if he was not granted deferment, the father indicated that Mr Ben Davis would still proceed to sign the contract, and he has done so. The reason given by the father was that his son would only return to fulfil his NS commitment if he is unsuccessful in his professional career. In fact, Mr Harvey Davis went further after MINDEF rejected the application – that he would consider the option for his son to renounce his Singapore citizenship in order to pursue his career. The father\\'s responses made clear his intent for his son to pursue a professional football career to the fullest. If Mr Ben Davis will not give up his senior contract, which provides for an allowance of a few hundred pounds a week, to serve his NS, it is even more unlikely that he will return to serve NS if he subsequently gets offered a contract worth many times more. And if he is not given a further contract with Fulham FC, the father has said that he may find other clubs which his son can be loaned to. The application by Mr Harvey Davis for his son\\'s deferment is to further his son’s professional career first and to the longest extent possible. He has been quite open about this. Singapore and her interests, including his son’s NS obligations, are secondary consideration, if at all. There has been no indication, commitment or plans as to how Mr Ben Davis would help football standards in Singapore, if deferred. Mr Harvey Davis has urged MINDEF to approve deferment for his son so that it would serve as an inspiration, he tells us for the 1000 students registered with his company JSSL, 500 or so who are local. JSSL Singapore, or Junior Soccer School & League Singapore, is a youth football club and academy business run by Mr Harvey Davis and advertises itself as having links to Fulham FC. MINDEF could not find any valid grounds to approve the application for deferment by Mr Harvey Davis for his son. There is no commitment to serve Singapore or our national interests. To grant deferment to Mr Ben Davis to pursue his personal development and professional career would be unfair to the many others who have served their NS dutifully as required, and not at a time of their choosing. It would also erode the basis on which our Courts have upheld the Enlistment Act passed by Parliament and punished those for not fulfilling their NS liabilities to pursue personal pursuits.As a writer, Mr Patrick Tan Siong Kuan, wrote to The Straits Times (ST) Forum – \"The defence of our country cannot be a matter of serving when it is most convenient. It is a responsibility that every man must take seriously when called upon, regardless of race, family connections or financial status. It takes personal sacrifice and putting the country before self. Otherwise, there will be no Singapore tomorrow.\"11  Mr Suresh Nair who wrote to the MINDEF Feedback Unit – \"If Davis is proud of his red passport, he must do what every Singapore teenager does, to dutifully observe the NS obligations.\"12  I know it must be difficult for a 17-year-old to receive such public attention. It was never MINDEF\\'s intent, but MINDEF had to respond to his father’s claims to the media to explain to MPs and Singaporeans the basis of our decision on this important policy. I have dealt with the application by Mr Harvey Davis for his son. Let me now address the important issue that MPs have asked – can and how do we achieve sporting excellence, including for team sports, if NS duties are to be fulfilled? NS does require sacrifices, certainly personal ones, but performing one\\'s NS duties and pursuing national aspirations for sports excellence need not be mutually exclusive.Many talented sportsmen have served NS as required and yet at the same time raised the level of their own skills and the teams they played with. To MINDEF\\'s knowledge, there are three other footballers who have also been talent spotted to take part in trials for professional leagues overseas. All three have completed their NS as required – Saifullah Akbar, Ikhsan and Irfan Fandi. In fact, Saifullah Akbar and Ikhsan Fandi asked to be enlisted early, presumably so that they could complete their NS early to pursue their professional careers. Prior to enlisting, Saifullah played for the Under-16 national team and was reportedly spotted by an Australian club at age 16 but went ahead to enlist for NS. During their NS, Irfan and Ikhsan trained and played for the Under-22 national team during the 2017 SEA Games, supported by the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) and Home Team. Irfan and Ikhsan are now playing for the Young Lions in the Singapore Premier League and representing Singapore in regional football competitions. I understand Irfan has gone for trials with European clubs, including an upcoming trial with Sporting Braga, and Saifullah and Ikhsan are slated to follow suit at CD Tenerife and Braga, respectively. All of us will certainly cheer them on to succeed. This is a good sign for football in Singapore and talented footballers, Ben Davis included, can emulate the example of Irfan, Saifullah and Ikhsan to complete both their NS duties as required and also advance their professional football careers.For the recent SEA Games 2015, and 2017, MINDEF supported those competing, both as a team and individually. Enlistment dates for NS were adjusted for those affected so that they could participate in the games first, including some footballers. Those who were already enlisted were given time off to train and maintain their peak performance. For the upcoming Asian Games later this month, so far, ten of our national servicemen have been given a short postponement of their enlistment of a few weeks, or if they have been enlisted, time off to train for the games, including a member of the Water Polo team who clinched their 27th straight SEA Games Gold medal last year. We wish all these sportsmen every success and hope that they continue to do well for Singapore in the Asian Games and beyond.  Besides these provisions, MINDEF has offered disruption to Full-time National Servicemen (NSFs) competing in these games. Very few have chosen to disrupt, perhaps because they are able to train adequately in the SAF. These many examples show that MINDEF has exercised flexibility towards sportsmen competing in team sports, a question asked by Dr Intan and Mr Muhamad Faisal and others. MINDEF has done so without transgressing the fundamentals of NS and still maintaining equity for all national servicemen. MINDEF will work with MCCY, SportSG and other relevant agencies through various pathways that can allow sportsmen to do well and still fulfil their NS obligations, be it in individual or team sports.'},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mr K Shanmugam: The Police will review Police reports to assess if an offence could have been committed, and whether further investigations are warranted. Where Police investigations are initiated, the facts of the case will be examined, and investigations conducted. Police reports and findings from investigations are retained. There are several good reasons for retaining the reports. For example, if there is a need to relook at what had happened, the records will be important.  Immigration facilities and Work Passes are assessed on the individual merits of the case. The factors taken into consideration include, among other things, criminal and security antecedents, if any. The NMP's question appears to be related to foreigners who apply for Short-Term Visit Passes, Work Passes, and Student's Passes. Foreigners have no absolute right to demand such immigration facilities in Singapore. It is for ICA and MOM to assess their eligibility for such facilities. Where a foreigner is being investigated in respect of a criminal offence, an application for an immigration facility, as mentioned by the NMP, will be held back, until the investigations are concluded. The investigations are obviously a relevant factor to consider. We assume that the NMP will not advocate that ICA or MOM grant an immigration pass to a foreigner who is being investigated (by way of an example) for committing a criminal offence like cheating people.  \"},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr K Shanmugam: From 2015 to 2017, the number of reported investment scams has doubled, from about 200 to over 400 cases a year. A key reason is the emergence of unregulated online investment platforms. These platforms allow trades across a wide range of products, such as currencies, shares, commodities and binary options. The public usually comes across such platforms via online advertisements, emails and unsolicited phone calls and messages. The operators of these online platforms are usually based outside Singapore, and payments are made directly to overseas bank accounts.Since 2015, the Commercial Affairs Department has charged 30 persons for their roles in 14 investment scams. The number of successfully prosecuted cases looks low compared to the number of Police reports. One of the reasons is that a significant proportion of investment scams today are committed remotely by syndicates operating in foreign countries, or the alleged investment assets, for example, distressed properties and agricultural products like seaweed farms, are overseas and difficult for Police to track down conclusively. Also, one investment scam may have multiple victims, resulting in many Police reports. Some losses alleged in reports are not due to scams, but the ups and downs of the market.A person who is convicted of a cheating offence under section 420 of the Penal Code may be liable for imprisonment of up to 10 years. MHA and MinLaw are reviewing the need to further strengthen our legislative levers against fraud offences, as part of the ongoing review of the Penal Code.Police will also continue to work closely with foreign law enforcement counterparts to crack down on overseas syndicates targeting Singaporeans.

       "  'answer': 'Mr Lawrence Wong: In the design and construction of HDB flats, HDB ensures that all its buildings, including the external facade features, are designed and installed in accordance to approved Codes of Practice, the Building Control Act and Regulations, as well as other statutory requirements. Inspections are carried out during construction to ensure that works are completed in compliance with the requirements. In the case of claddings and fixtures, these installations are usually designed and supervised by a Specialist Qualified Person, who is a Professional Engineer and the plans must be approved by BCA. Once the buildings have obtained the Temporary Occupation Permit, building owners are required to ensure that the building exterior is maintained in a serviceable state under the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act. For HDB estates, Town Councils conduct regular inspections on the building facades as they are responsible for the maintenance of common property. Where necessary, they will engage a Professional Engineer to follow up on the repairs required.  The Periodic Facade Inspection (PFI) regime aims to enable early detection of tell-tale signs of deteriorating facade elements. It adopts a risk-based approach to balance enhanced safety against increased costs for building owners. This is why the PFI regime is scoped to focus on buildings above 20 years old, and excludes private landed houses, temporary buildings and low rise buildings.Notwithstanding the PFI regime, should any facade be dislodged from buildings, BCA will carry out an independent investigation on the incident to verify the cause of dislodgement. For HDB projects, HDB will also appoint an independent consultant to carry out checks on the HDB blocks with similar facade features to ensure there are no safety concerns. This is done regardless of the age of the building. '},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Heng Swee Keat: The Government encourages all employers to have good re-employment and age-friendly hiring practices. This is achieved through broad-based measures that are available to all employers, including Government’s outsourced providers. For instance, the Special Employment Credit provides wage offsets to employers who hire older Singaporean workers aged 55 and above and earning up to $4,000 a month. An additional wage-offset of up to 3% of monthly wages encourages the employment of older workers above the re-employment age of 67. To facilitate age-friendly employment practices, companies can tap on the WorkPro Age Management Grant. The Government has also worked with tripartite partners on the Tripartite Standard on Age-friendly Workplace Practices to encourage employers to adopt age-friendly practices. These employers commit not to use age as a selection criterion in recruitment, and commit to engage employees on re-employment issues at least six months prior to the retirement age and subsequent extension of re-employment contract. The tripartite partners have also issued the Tripartite Guidelines on Re-employment of Older Employees which provides and calls on employers to adopt good practices in re-employment. In support of these efforts, the Government ensures that its tender specifications do not discriminate against outsourced workers in any industry based on factors such as age or gender. As the primary objective of procurement is to obtain goods and services, our specifications do not dictate the employment practices of service providers. Promoting good employment practices is better achieved through the measures described above.

       "  'answer': 'Mr Gan Kim Yong: Breast cancer is the most common cancer among females in Singapore, and the risk of developing the disease rises with age. The Health Promotion Board (HPB) works with healthcare providers and community partners on awareness and public education efforts on breast self-examinations. For example, HPB partners the Breast Cancer Foundation and the Singapore Cancer Society on outreach activities during the Breast Cancer Awareness Month in October each year. An information booklet on breast self-examination is also available at all polyclinics. These efforts benefit females of all ages, including students. Previous surveys have found that approximately 45% of women in Singapore performed regular breast self-examinations1. Because the risk of breast cancer rises with age, HPB puts added emphasis on females of working age and beyond, rather than students. For example, it recommends that from the age of 30, females should do regular breast self-examinations.

       "  'answer': 'Mr S Iswaran: The original Digital TV (DTV) Assistance Scheme, launched in September 2014, was aimed at helping low-income households transit from analogue free-to-air (FTA) TV to DTV, by providing and installing DTV equipment for them for free.In April 2018, the Government expanded the DTV Assistance Scheme to help more Singaporean households move to DTV before analogue FTA TV ceases on 31 December 2018. The expanded Scheme is known as the DTV Starter Kit. It allows all Singaporean HDB households without a Pay TV subscription to redeem either DTV equipment with free installation, or a $100 voucher to offset the cost of purchasing selected DTV equipment. Singaporean households that have switched over to DTV on their own are not disadvantaged in any way because they can still enjoy the DTV Starter Kit by redeeming the DTV equipment for their TV sets (including as back-up) or for their secondary TV sets (if any), as long as they meet the eligibility criteria as stated above.

       "  'answer': 'Mr Desmond Lee: Students with special educational needs (SEN) who graduate from mainstream secondary schools and Special Education (SPED) schools may apply for enrolment into Post-Secondary Education Institutions (PSEIs) (that is, junior colleges and centralised institutes, polytechnics and the Institute of Technical Education [ITE]) or specialised vocational training schools for further studies or vocational training.  Most of the students with a SEN diagnosis in mainstream schools, similar to their schoolmates, advance to the PSEIs every year. For those in SPED schools, a smaller proportion move to the PSEIs, given their need for more specialised and intensive support. Since 2014, SEN Support Offices have been set up in all polytechnics, ITE colleges, Autonomous Universities and arts institutions. These offices serve as a first-stop support unit for students to provide course counselling and access arrangements for students with SEN. They also administer funding support for students with physical or sensory impairment to purchase Assistive Technology devices and support services. The SEN Support Offices also collaborate with Voluntary Welfare Organisations to provide external support for students with SEN, such as internship placements and job matching. MOE will continue to work with the PSEIs and agencies such as SG Enable, to ensure that students receive sufficient support to continue with education and prepare for future employment.   For students with moderate to severe SEN, two schools, Metta School and Delta Senior School, offer vocational training leading to nationally-accredited certifications for students up to 21 years old. Each year, about 120 students with Intellectual Disability graduate with vocational certifications in a range of industry areas. These schools continually update their vocational programmes so that SPED students of diverse disabilities can be better prepared for employment. For SPED students who may not benefit from vocational certification but are capable of work, SG Enable works with SPED schools to support their transition into employment under the School-to-Work (S2W) Transition Programme. Students on the programme receive customised job training with job support from Job Coaches for up to one year post graduation to prepare them for eventual employment. About 30 students each year with diverse disabilities have benefitted from the S2W Transition Programme. The programme will be rolled out to all SPED schools serving secondary-level students by 2019. Other SPED students with heavier care needs may require closer supervision in their daily lives. They can be admitted into Sheltered Workshops or Day Activity Centres, depending on the level of care support required. Sheltered Workshops allows Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) to be engaged in completing straightforward tasks that are part of a simplified work process. Day Activity Centres provide long-term care services and equip PwDs with skills so that they can live as independently as possible within their homes and community. These centres provide therapeutic and behavioural intervention, training in interpersonal and community living skills, and support in activities of daily living.'},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB heartland shops play an important role in serving the needs of residents, and HDB has put in place several measures to ensure that our neighbourhood centres remain relevant and vibrant places. First, new neighbourhood centres come with well-designed plazas and gardens to draw residents to these community spaces. Second, HDB curates the trade-mix to improve the vibrancy of the neighbourhood centres. Third, HDB has extended the enhanced Friendly Faces, Lively Places grant to HDB retailers and Merchant Associations (MAs) so that they can organise community and volunteer events to attract footfall. Fourth, HDB introduced the Revitalisation of Shops (ROS) Scheme in 2007 to help retailers and MAs enhance the vibrancy and competitiveness of HDB shops, through co-funding the upgrading of common areas and promotional events, and granting rent-free periods for tenants to renovate their shops. The subsidies provided under ROS were recently enhanced in May 2016. Since then, 17 sites have been announced under the seventh batch of the ROS. These include:(a) 13 sites which have applied for co-funding for upgrading of the common areas, of which, upgrading works at 3 sites have either commenced or will be commencing by October 2018. (b) 11 sites which have applied for co-funding for promotional events, have successfully organised events at the respective centres.In addition, to help our heartland businesses deal with the rising competition from e-commerce retailers and private shopping malls, the Retail Industry Transformation Map (ITM) was launched in 2016. A key strategy is to help local retailers integrate their e-commerce and digital marketing capabilities into their business models to reach out to more customers. Some assistance available to local retailers include: ·               The 12 SME Centres located island-wide, where advisors can guide SMEs in the use of digital technology to boost their productivity.·               The Retail Industry Digital Plan (IDP), launched by IMDA in partnership with Enterprise Singapore (ESG), provides SMEs step-by-step guidance on the use of digital technology at each stage of their growth.·               HDB and ESG are also working to encourage HDB retailers to become more competitive via the Productivity Solutions Grant (PSG), which supports the adoption of pre-scoped IT solutions in areas such as customer management, inventory tracking, and e-commerce.  To date, more than 300 retail SMEs have applied for PSG support, and this number is expected to increase in future.·               IMDA will expand the list of pre-approved solutions in e-commerce to help SME retailers develop and strengthen their online presence.  HDB retailers can also establish an online presence at no cost on HDB’s Where2Shop (W2S) website. To support these digitalisation efforts, HDB will be separately trialling free wireless internet service under Wireless@SG and a shopper traffic monitoring system at some of the HDB shopping complexes. The latter will allow HDB to collect data to gain insights on customer footfall and customer profiles, to help heartland retailers tweak their programmes and promotional deals to better meet the needs of shoppers. Kampung Admiralty and Oasis Terraces will be benefiting from these initiatives. In addition, MAs in our town and neighbourhood centres can tap on ROS to implement digital initiatives, including the installation of digital directories, wireless routers and footfall sensors.'},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mrs Josephine Teo: In the past five years, 130 Foreign Domestic Workers (FDWs) per year or six FDWs per 10,000 FDWs in Singapore were found to be younger than the age requirement of at least 23 years. MOM adopts a multi-layered approach to prevent underaged FDWs from working in Singapore. First, it is the responsibility of employment agencies (EAs) to ensure that the FDWs they have sourced meet the age requirement. The agencies are required to do upstream checks on the FDWs before they are deployed to Singapore. Action will be taken against EAs that fail to do so. Since 2013, MOM has taken action against over a hundred EAs. We meted out penalties ranging from warnings, demerit points and forfeiture of their security deposit, to prosecution for flagrant cases. Recently, two EAs were prosecuted and convicted, and fined the maximum $5,000 each. Their licences will also be revoked. In addition to these measures, MOM makes it a point to highlight the minimum age requirement to FDWs before their arrival in Singapore through the In-Principle Approval letter sent to all FDWs, as well as through the compulsory Settling-In Programme (SIP) for first-time FDWs. During the programme, FDWs are warned of the consequences they face should they be found to be underaged. They are also given the chance to come forward if they are under 23 years old. Those who own up are assured of passage home and they will be allowed back to Singapore to work after they turn 23. On top of these steps, MOM also conducts visual checks during the SIP and work pass card registration. FDWs who flout the minimum age requirement will be permanently debarred from working in Singapore. MOM urges employers to be vigilant of the FDWs' age. Putting their elderly or children in the care of an underaged FDW poses significant risks. Employers are advised to report to MOM if they suspect that their FDW is underaged. Lastly, as the passport remains the primary document for identification and age verification, it is important that the authorities in source countries step up efforts to improve the accuracy of their official documents. Therefore, when we uncover cases of FDWs with inaccurate ages, we will provide such information to source country Governments. \"},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Ong Ye Kung: As at December 2017, there were 30,000 students with a reported Special Educational Need (SEN). About 80% of them are in mainstream schools and 20% are in Special Education (SPED) schools. Many children with SEN obtain a diagnosis during their pre-school years – usually at KKH and NUH Child Development Centres – and a majority of them benefit from early intervention.  Today, the 19 SPED schools are geographically spread across the island, with most SPED schools in heartland locations such as Ang Mo Kio, Hougang, Jurong West and Yishun. Three additional SPED school campuses have started operations this year and additional SPED school campuses are being planned.  Amongst the 19 SPED schools are those that focus on the needs of students with a specific disability profile, as well as those which serve a range of disabilities. For example, a student with moderate to severe cerebral palsy would attend the CPAS school, a student with moderate to severe Intellectual Disability as well as autism could attend a MINDS school and a student with multiple disabilities and autism could attend a Rainbow Centre school. Because the number of students with a specific SEN is not large, many are best served by central and specialised centres. This means that it may not always be possible to find a suitable SPED in the neighbourhood. Notwithstanding, over the years, we have made good progress towards ensuring that each child with SEN is able to attend a school that caters to his needs.   '},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Ong Ye Kung: Negative perceptions of mental illness can stem from the lack of awareness and understanding of mental health. The IMH-led study also noted that majority of the students would reach out to, stand up for and support a classmate with mental illness, which is encouraging. Mental illnesses are caused by a variety of factors. To support students with mental illnesses, schools have been stepping up efforts to nurture the social and emotional competencies of our students, strengthen supportive school relationships, increase peer support efforts and encourage help-seeking behaviour. We work closely with parents and community partners to strengthen mental well-being and reduce the stigma for those suffering from mental illnesses.  MOE leverages the Character and Citizenship Education, school-based conversations and student learning resources to raise awareness and de-stigmatise mental illnesses.

       "  'answer': 'Mr K Shanmugam: Community mediation is generally a voluntary process, and can be proceeded with only if both parties agree to mediate. For cases that do not proceed with mediation, the parties may end up resolving their issues through other informal means. For example:(a)                They have directly communicated with each other and arrived at a resolution; or(b)                Grassroots or community leaders have assisted the parties to hold a conversation that leads to a satisfactory outcome for them. However, for intractable cases where parties are unable to resolve their disputes by voluntary mediation or other informal means, the aggrieved party can file a case with the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals (CDRT) as a last resort. The CDRT judge can order the parties to attend mandatory mediation in the Courts or at the Community Mediation Centre (CMC), attend counselling or fix the case for hearing. Therefore, while community mediation is generally voluntary, an avenue of compulsory mediation does exist, and the failure to comply with the CDRT’s order to attend mediation may attract legal consequences. Where the CDRT judge, on hearing the parties, decides to make a Court Order, this order can entail the payment of damages, require a party to do or refrain from doing something (for example, take measures to prevent cigarette smoke from drifting into neighbouring units), or apologise. If a party breaches the Court Order, the other party can apply for a Special Direction to ensure compliance. A refusal to comply with a Special Direction may lead to, among other measures an Exclusion Order – this requires the non-compliant party to move out of his home.  Written settlements reached by parties through mediation at CMC are private contracts. These contracts are binding on both parties. The aggrieved party therefore has the option to enforce the agreement through civil proceedings. Alternatively, if the parties feel it may be useful, the CMC will offer parties another round of mediation at no further cost.'},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mrs Josephine Teo: Our foreign manpower policy is designed to support a vibrant and innovative economy. Conditions for work pass applications are consistently applied. However, where economic agencies have assessed the need to provide additional support to meet specific objectives, we also need to exercise flexibility.  In deciding whether an enterprise merits such flexibility, MOM relies on the assessment of economic agencies like EDB, EnterpriseSG and IMDA. Examples of cases where flexibility can be considered include the following:(a) Under the Lean Enterprise Development (LED) Scheme, an enterprise implements a productivity enhancing project that would ultimately make it more manpower-lean. The employer has to hire temporary staff so that it can properly introduce a new system while being able to meet its operational needs using the existing system and manpower. However, during the transition, the additional staff would cause it to exceed the prevailing Dependency Ratio Ceiling (DRC).(b) Under the Capability Transfer Programme (CTP), an enterprise needs the help of foreign specialists to support the implementation of improved technologies or processes and build up the local team. However, while these specialists have the required expertise, they may not meet all the conditions of work pass applications e.g. salary requirements.(c) Early-stage start-ups usually structure their pay packages as a combination of salary and non-cash remuneration such as stock options, for both local and foreign hires. The salary component alone may not be sufficient to meet the prevailing Employment Pass (EP) salary criteria but the presence of these start-ups adds to our economic dynamism.  In the past five years, an average of 400 enterprises were provided with such enterprise-level flexibility at any one time, constituting 0.5% of all employers of work pass holders. To ensure a level playing field, the same considerations are consistently applied to any enterprise that is able to provide similar justifications.'},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Ong Ye Kung: The proportion of the Primary One cohort that did not complete secondary education has fallen from 4% in 2000 to less than 1% currently. This is due to the concerted effort of schools, agencies and community partners.The reasons for dropping out are usually a combination of factors, including personal and family circumstances, desire to work rather than study, negative peer influence outside of school, lack of motivation to learn and difficulties coping with their studies.Teachers in schools mark students’ attendance daily. Schools have systems in place to promptly notify parents and check on the students when they are absent without valid reasons. Active steps are also taken to engage students who display irregular attendance, including counselling, parent engagement and home visits.Since 2009, schools have implemented the Time Out Programme to provide enhanced guidance and support for disengaged students, to help them overcome the difficulties that have kept them away from school. Additional support is provided by School Counsellors and Student Welfare Officers who support students in addressing their emotional and behavioural issues and work closely with the family and other community partners to encourage them to return to school. Besides school-based solutions, MOE also taps on the expertise of our partners, such as Social Service Offices, Family Service Centres, Self-Help Groups and Voluntary Welfare Organisations. For example, students who drop out of school are referred to the Enhanced STEP-UP Programme set up by the Ministry of Social and Family Development. Under this programme, VWOs engage out-of-school youths and their families, to encourage the youths to re-engage their schools and community again.'},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mrs Josephine Teo: As of end 2017, 42% of those who turned age 55 in 2016 did not withdraw any CPF monies within a year of their 55th birthday. This includes the first $5,000 from the Ordinary and Special Accounts (OA and SA) which members can withdraw unconditionally, monies above their cohort Full Retirement Sum, as well as monies above Basic Retirement Sum which can be withdrawn using property charge or pledge. For those who did withdraw, the majority, about 6 in 10 members, withdrew up to $5,000.For the same cohort, about 53% of active members met their Full Retirement Sum in cash and pledge at age 55 in 2016 (i.e., able to set aside the Full Retirement Sum fully in cash, or met Basic Retirement Sum in cash and provided sufficient property pledge or charge). Of this group, about 5 in 10 left additional funds in their CPF Ordinary or Special Accounts. Based on our observations, members do so because they have no immediate need of the money, or they wish to take advantage of the higher CPF risk-free interest rates.From 2013 to 2017, an annual average of 13,500 CPF members, or 0.4% of total CPF members, withdrew their CPF monies when they left Singapore. This includes former Singapore Citizens (SC), former Permanent Residents (PR) and foreigners who contributed to the CPF before 2003. Former SC and PR members can leave their monies in the CPF after they have given up their Singapore citizenship or permanent residency.

       "  'answer': 'Mr S Iswaran: oBike, like any other business in Singapore, is required to comply with the data protection obligations under the Personal Data Protection Act (“PDPA”). If a business has no legal or business purpose for the personal data in its possession or control, the PDPA requires it to stop retaining such data.The PDPA continues to apply to a company undergoing liquidation. Where a liquidator is appointed, the liquidator will also have to ensure that the company undergoing liquidation continues to comply with the PDPA. This includes the obligations to protect customer data during liquidation and expunging customer data at the end of the winding-up process if there is no legal or business purpose to retain it.The personal data of customers in Singapore cannot be treated as assets and sold without their consent. In winding up a company, the company’s liquidator may sell the whole or part of the company, its assets, or business. If such a sale takes place, customer data that is directly relevant to the transaction may be transferred to the acquirer. However, under the PDPA, customers must be notified that their personal data has been transferred. If customers do not wish for the acquiring company to use their personal data, they can approach the acquiring company to withdraw their consent, whereupon the acquiring company shall then delete the personal data once there is no legal or business purpose to retain it.The Personal Data Protection Commission (“PDPC”) expects oBike and its liquidators to continue complying with the PDPA even as it prepares to exit the market in Singapore. PDPC has reminded oBike of its obligations under the PDPA, and is monitoring the situation closely.

An estimated 100,000 members of the public have already enjoyed these free screenings.Nine FIFA World Cup 2018 matches are also being broadcast “live” on Mediacorp’s Okto channel for free. Six of these matches have already been broadcast, as will the two Semi-Finals and the Final in the coming days.It is becoming more challenging to provide such “live” broadcasts of international sports events for free. Broadcast rights for international sports events such as the FIFA World Cup are commercially negotiated. Over the years, the cost of these broadcast rights has grown significantly. For the FIFA World Cup 2018, broadcasters in the region paid an estimated 25% to 75% more this year compared to 2014.

       "  'answer': 'Mr Chan Chun Sing (for the Prime Minister): Public officers who joined the Service after 1994 are placed on the Medisave-cum-Subsidised Outpatient (MSO) scheme. This is a portable medical benefit scheme which provides 2% of an officer’s monthly salary as additional Medisave contributions, in lieu of hospitalisation benefits, and an annual subsidy of $500 for outpatient treatments. Under the MSO scheme, an officer may receive an additional Medisave contribution of up to $2,730 annually1. The MSO scheme is regularly reviewed to ensure it remains market competitive. In the last review in 2015, the Civil Service increased additional Medisave contributions from 1% to 2%.All Singaporeans are covered under MediShield Life. On top of that, public officers can use their additional Medisave contributions to purchase Integrated Shield Plans (IPs) to supplement their MediShield Life coverage. In addition, the Public Service Division (PSD) has also appointed a panel of insurance companies to offer portable IPs at discounted premiums to public officers and their dependants. These IPs are individual contracts between the officers and insurers, and will continue to cover officers even after they change employers.Over and above the MSO scheme benefits, and PSD’s facilitation for public officers and their dependants to take up portable IPs at discounted premiums, one particular Statutory Board (SB) had further arranged for its officers to be covered under a Group Hospitalisation and Surgical (H&S) plan. This is even though there is no obligation to do so. Under H&S plan, the insurance is not portable and will not cover officers after they leave the SB. The H&S plan of the SB expired in Dec 2017.

We are also heartened by the strong commitment and enthusiasm shown by our SVs, with a low drop-out rate of 3%. The reasons cited for dropping out were mainly due to being unable to meet the medical and training requirements. Our pool of SVs comprises a good balance of males and females, with over 40% being females. The high number of interested females is heartening, and many of them have excelled. SV1 Nur Fadilah Bte Judir is one example. SV1 Fadilah had joined the SAFVC to better understand and appreciate what male Singaporeans go through to defend Singapore. Through her SAFVC training and subsequent deployment as an Auxiliary Security Trooper, she was able to develop the necessary skills and knowledge to contribute to national defence.MINDEF/SAF has continually looked at ways to enhance the SAFVC scheme, to better achieve its objectives of allowing more Singaporeans and Permanent Residents to contribute to national defence, show support for National Service, and deepen their understanding and ownership of national defence. SVs are deployed alongside national servicemen and regulars to support the SAF’s operations and training, and the SAFVC’s training is regularly reviewed to ensure that it is safe, progressive, and effective.

       "  'answer': 'Mr Chan Chun Sing:  In 2017, overall labour productivity, as measured by real value-added (VA) per actual hour worked (AHW), rose by 4.5%. Due to data collection constraints, data on real VA per AHW by firms’ SME and non-SME status are not available. The Government also measures labour productivity in terms of real VA per worker. In 2017, real VA per worker in the overall economy increased by 3.8%. Based on MTI’s estimates, SMEs recorded slightly lower real VA per worker growth of 3.2% in 2017. A breakdown of SMEs’ productivity performance by sectors is not available.  The Government has put in place several initiatives to support SMEs in raising their productivity. Across all sectors, SMEs can approach any of the 12 SME Centres for free business advisory services. The SME Centres collectively engage over 20,000 businesses each year through advisory sessions, capability workshops and outreach events. The number of SMEs that embarked on capability development projects with support from the SME Centres almost doubled from 600 in 2013 to 1,100 in 2017. SMEs can also approach experts at the two Productivity Centres for assistance in productivity solutions. The Singapore Innovation and Productivity Institute focuses on manufacturing, engineering, logistics and related industries, while the Singapore Productivity Centre focuses on the retail, food services and hotel sectors. SMEs can also leverage technology and digital solutions to raise productivity through schemes like the $110 million Productivity Solutions Grant (PSG) for pre-scoped equipment and IT solutions. On top of these broad-based efforts, the Government works with industry and unions to foster improvements in Productivity, Jobs & Skills, Innovation, and Trade & Internationalisation within and across 23 key sectors, through the Industry Transformation Maps.

Preliminary findings indicate that the fire was caused by a lightning strike on the rooftop of the tank.The Fire Code requires oil storage tanks to have a lightning protection system. The SCDF is investigating why the system seemed to have failed in this case.The first responders to the fire were the company’s Company Emergency Response Team, also known as CERT, stationed on Pulau Busing itself. Under the Fire Safety Act, companies storing more than five metric tonnes of petroleum and flammable materials are required to form a CERT. CERT members are trained in fire-fighting, rescue and first aid and are the first responders to fight the fire, before SCDF arrives. Companies are also required to provide a suite of fire-fighting systems and equipment. These include fixed and mobile fire-fighting monitors, foam-pouring protection systems, and water pumps. These regulatory measures helped to contain the Pulau Busing fire. The CERT managed to prevent the spread of the fire before SCDF arrived. During the fire, other companies on neighbouring islands also provided resources to help fight the fire. This is part of the industry-led Emergency Mutual Aid scheme. This was a large-scale fire and SCDF had to mount a complex operation to prevent the fire from spreading to adjacent oil tanks, and to extinguish it.

       "  'answer': 'Mr Khaw Boon Wan:  Detrainment procedures are designed to ensure the safety of passengers and are similar across all our rail lines. During a breakdown, the first priority for any operator is to resolve the fault and resume service quickly, so that passengers can alight at the platform. If this cannot be done, passengers may need to be detrained to the tracks.During any detrainment, the safety of passengers is the key consideration. Prior to detrainment, train services must be halted and traction power switched off in the affected zone. Passengers will be informed through in-train announcements that a detrainment is necessary, and that assistance is on its way. Customer Service Officers (CSOs) will be dispatched to the affected train to guide passengers to the nearest station safely. Before exiting the train, the CSOs will brief passengers on how to detrain safely, including how to exit the train cabin and where to walk on the emergency walkway in order to avoid trackside equipment. Any passengers with special needs, such as those on wheelchairs, will also be assisted by the CSOs, with the help of fellow passengers. The current detrainment process is safe and has worked well so far. LTA monitors and reviews how our Public Transport Operators (PTOs) respond to each train disruption. The lessons learnt are used to continuously improve incident management plans, including the detrainment process. The PTOs also conduct regular exercises to ensure that staff are operationally ready to manage a detrainment.'},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Khaw Boon Wan:  LTA will study the need for bicycle-sharing operators (BSOs) to place a security deposit or performance bond if there are BSOs which require user deposits when the licensing regime is implemented from October this year. Currently, seven BSOs have applied for licences. None of them require user deposits. A number of them are existing BSOs who even under the light touch approach adopted today do not require user deposits. To facilitate the growth of this nascent industry and ensure that bicycle sharing services remain affordable, LTA has refrained from over-regulating BSOs as this can increase their compliance costs, which could in turn be passed on to users. The licensing regime is primarily targeted at minimising disamenities to the public caused by the indiscriminate parking of shared bicycles. To be licensed, BSOs must put forward a responsible and sustainable bicycle management plan to operate in our local context.  Going forward, LTA will monitor and strengthen the licensing regime as necessary, as well as work with relevant organisations such as the Personal Data Protection Commission, the Consumers Association of Singapore, National Parks and the Town Councils on public education and outreach, so as to strike the right balance between the viability of the industry and the interests of users and the general public.'},\n",

LTA has stepped up enforcement efforts and has issued more than 3,300 removal notices to date.To more effectively address the issue, LTA will implement a licensing regime for bicycle-sharing operators by end 2018. This will allow LTA to manage the size of each operator’s fleet, require operators to manage indiscriminate parking and encourage responsible user behaviour. Under the licensing regime, operators will be required to implement QR code geo-fencing and impose a penalty on users who do not park within the designated areas. Users who repeatedly park improperly will be banned temporarily from renting shared bicycles from all operators.   Apart from regulatory measures, LTA has worked with the operators on a public awareness campaign to educate users on responsible parking.

       "  'answer': 'Mr Chan Chun Sing:  The Government recognises the importance of reliable and secure infrastructure, both in terms of power and telecommunication systems, as Singapore gears up for increasing digital operations as a “Smart Nation”.On the power system front, SP Power Grid (SPPG), the national grid operator, has a comprehensive infrastructure planning and maintenance regime to increase system reliability and minimise disruptions. This includes building in redundancy for critical components, continuous monitoring of the transmission network, and conducting preventive maintenance. Workers are trained and reminded to adhere strictly to operating procedures. That said, there can still be the occasional instance of human error, such as during the blackout on 1 June 2018. We have adopted a calibrated risk-based approach in systems planning, with a framework in place to enable quick restoration of power when needed. This calibrated risk-based approach has served us well, with our power system being among the most reliable in the world. For instance, from FY13 to FY17, Singapore’s average annual disruption per consumer ranged from 12 seconds to 45 seconds, compared to latest FY15 figures of 4 minutes for Tokyo and 23.4 minutes for Hong Kong.For telecommunication infrastructure, MCI and IMDA have also put in place measures to ensure resilience. These include Codes of Practices that set baseline requirements to ensure that our telecommunication networks are fit for purpose and on par with international best practices, as well as to encourage telecommunication operators to adopt more advanced resilience practices. IMDA also engages the telecommunication operators regularly to conduct exercises on recovering from service disruptions, and discuss initiatives to enhance the resilience of our networks.Telecommunication service disruptions sometimes occur due to cable cuts committed by errant contractors. MCI and IMDA have therefore put in place several measures to mitigate the risk of such disruptions. For example, the Telecommunications Act requires contractors to employ licensed Telecommunication Cable Detection Workers to detect the presence of underground cables prior to commencing earthworks. In addition, IMDA holds regular dialogue sessions with contractors to encourage the adoption of precautionary measures when carrying out earthworks, as well as the need for training for workers. Where disruption to telecommunication services occurs due to cable cuts, IMDA will not hesitate to enforce any breaches of the Telecommunications Act by prosecuting the relevant parties in Court. MTI and EMA also have similar measures in place for earthwork damage to electricity cables, and these are enforced through the Electricity Act, relevant Code of Practices and licensing conditions.To minimise the impact on consumers in the event of disruptions, IMDA incentivises telecommunication licensees to restore services quickly by imposing penalties that will take into account the duration of the disruption, amongst other factors. IMDA also prescribes baseline requirements for key telecommunication licensees’ business continuity planning to facilitate recovery during service disruptions'},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Lawrence Wong:  The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) is currently conducting a consultation exercise to seek the public’s views on a proposed regulatory framework for the use of private homes as short-term accommodation (STA).Under this framework, URA proposes to establish a new use category for STA under the Planning Act. URA will assess the eligibility of a property for STA use by considering factors such as its location and surrounding uses. For strata-titled developments such as condominiums, STA use will only be allowed if there is support of at least 80 per cent in share value.  The framework proposes several measures to mitigate the potential dis-amenities arising from STA. These include an annual 90-day cap on STA use, an occupancy cap of six persons per home, and submission of STA guests’ details as part of the registration process. All STA units will also need to comply with fire safety regulations.In addition, we are studying the possibility of regulating STA platforms through a licensing framework. This means that platform operators will be required to obtain a licence to advertise any STA activities in Singapore.

       "  'answer': 'Mr Lawrence Wong: Singapore Citizen households enjoy a significant housing subsidy when they buy a new flat from HDB or a resale flat from the open market with a CPF housing grant. If they purchase another flat from HDB, they are no longer eligible for the full subsidy, which is meant for first-timers only. Hence a resale levy is imposed if they are not a first-timer.Nonetheless, we have put in place various measures to help seniors who purchase a 2-room Flexi flat from HDB. Since 2015, we have waived the accrued interest for seniors liable for the percentage resale levy2. For those who purchase a short lease 2-room Flexi flat, we provide further help by capping their resale levy and adjusting it for the shorter lease. This means that the maximum resale levy that would be paid on a 2-room Flexi with a 45-year lease is $18,000, much lower than what the normal resale levy would be.We will continue to review our policies to ensure that they maintain a fair allocation of public housing subsidies between first-time buyers and other buyers.'},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Lawrence Wong:  There are currently about 450 families who were successful in their application and are waiting to be allocated a public rental flat. At this juncture, families can be allocated a rental flat in about 2 months from the time of their application, if they are not particular about location. This has fallen significantly from a peak of 21 months in 2008. Some waiting time is inevitable as HDB needs to assess each application. The allocation of rental flats is also subject to considerations such as the household’s locational preferences, the quotas under the Ethnic Integration Policy, and the setting aside of vacant flats to house existing tenants whose rental blocks are due for redevelopment.The Fresh Start Housing Scheme was launched in December 2016 to help second-timer families with young children living in public rental housing to own a home again. As of May 2018, 70 households have been emplaced on the scheme.

       "  'answer': 'Mr Chan Chun Sing: The Gini coefficient published by the Department of Statistics (DOS) is computed based on household income from work. Both employer and employee CPF contributions are included in the definition of household income from work. This is because CPF contributions are a significant component of compensation from work, and can be used by households for housing, healthcare and investment purposes. Nonetheless, DOS also publishes a Gini coefficient that excludes employer CPF contributions from household income from work.Both Gini coefficients are available on DOS’ website. In 2017, the Gini coefficient which includes employer CPF contributions was 0.459, while the Gini coefficient which excludes employer CPF contributions was 0.468. The former is lower because there is a cap on employer CPF contributions for employees who have reached the wage ceiling of $6,000.DOS does not publish a Gini coefficient that excludes both employer and employee CPF contributions from household income from work.'},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M:  The National Recycling Programme (NRP) was launched in 2001 to complement the efforts of the informal recycling sector. Since then, the National Environment Agency (NEA) has enhanced the NRP to make it more convenient for residents to recycle. For example, from 2011, one blue recycling bin is provided for every HDB block, an increase from one for every five blocks.These efforts have contributed to an increase in the recyclables collected under the NRP, from 25,300 tonnes in 2011 to 44,400 tonnes in 2017. A survey conducted in 2015/2016 also showed that among residents who recycle, 9 in 10 use the NRP blue bins. While we have made progress on this front, we can do more to make recycling a part of daily living for all Singaporeans. Our recycling rates have not caught up with our increased consumption and purchasing habits, with Singapore’s domestic recycling rate hovering at around 20 percent since 2012. We encourage Singaporeans to recycle more and make sustainable living choices so as to lower our carbon footprint.The Government will continue to facilitate recycling. For example, all new HDB developments will provide dual chutes for refuse and recyclables, to make it more convenient for residents to recycle. From 1 April 2018, new non-landed private residential developments taller than four storeys are similarly required to be equipped with dual chutes. We will also require existing condominiums to provide one recycling bin per block from 1 August 2018. Everyone must also play their part to segregate their waste and utilise the recycling facilities provided. More importantly, let us all be gracious and not waste the efforts of our fellow Singaporeans by contaminating recycling bins with food or liquid waste.Public Waste Collectors (PWCs) are required to return recycling bins to their designated locations after collection. NEA conducts spot-checks to ensure that recycling bins are at their designated locations. From the second half of 2018, starting with the public waste collection contract for the Pasir Ris-Bedok sector, NEA will introduce a new requirement for PWCs to mark the locations of the recycling bins on the floor. Members of the public who find recycling bins outside the demarcated area should inform NEA, which will then conduct investigations and penalise the respective PWC if they are found liable for the breach. NEA is also conducting a trial using side-loader trucks which have mechanised arms that will empty recycling bins to load recyclables in the truck. As part of this trial, the existing blue recycling bins will be replaced with new bins which are larger and more difficult to move. This will reduce the likelihood of unauthorised movement of the bins.We will continue to monitor the effectiveness of these measures, before deciding if further measures, such as geo-fencing, are necessary.'},\n",

Two-thirds of Singapore is water catchment area and raw water collected there is meant to be treated into potable water. Meanwhile, the used water collected in our public sewerage system is largely treated and reclaimed for NEWater.To safeguard our water resources and the environment, both PUB and the National Environment Agency (NEA) require Written Approvals or Written Permissions to be obtained prior to the discharge of trade effluent into public sewerage systems, or into watercourses and onto land, respectively. As part of the Written Approvals or Written Permissions, companies must comply with the relevant provisions under the Sewerage and Drainage Act (SDA) or Environment Protection and Management Act (EPMA) and their respective regulations when they discharge their trade effluent.

Under the SDA and EPMA, where trade effluent is discharged into the public sewers without a Written Approval or into drains or land without a Written Permission, the offender could be fined up to $20,000 with a further fine not exceeding $1,000 per day if the offence continues after conviction. Similar penalties apply if the discharge is not in accordance with the conditions of the Written Approval or Permission. Under the SDA, if the trade effluent discharged into the public sewers contains dangerous or hazardous substances, a fine of up to $50,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both can be imposed on first-time offenders. For repeat offenders, the maximum fine will be doubled to $100,000. The maximum penalties are further increased to $200,000 or to a jail term not exceeding 2 years should the illegal discharge cause injury or death to any person or disrupt the water reclamation processes. Similarly, under the EPMA, any person who discharges any toxic or hazardous substance into inland water so as to be likely to cause pollution of the environment would be liable to a fine of up to $50,000 or to imprisonment for a term up to 12 months or to both. The EPMA also provides for heavier penalties for repeat offenders.Both PUB and NEA also have the powers to require an offender to immediately cease any process or work that produces toxic, dangerous or hazardous substance or trade effluent that contains such substances. The offender may also be ordered by the Court to restore the public sewerage system to its original condition, or ordered by NEA to remove and clean up the toxic substance from the drain or land.We take a serious view of keeping the watercourses and sewers free from pollution and will not hesitate to take enforcement action. We will continue to monitor the effectiveness of our regulatory regimes in safeguarding our water resources and review the penalties, if necessary.'},\n",
       " 851: {'title': 'ensuring comparable food prices at hawker stalls and coffee shops in new hdb estates vs-a-vis those in mature estates',\n",
       "  'question': 'Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources what can the Ministry do to ensure that the food prices at hawker centres and coffee shops in new estates such as Sengkang, Tampines and Sembawang are comparable to those in matured estates as shown in the Makan Index.',\n",
       "  'answer': 'Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M:  The Makan Index, developed by the Institute of Policy Studies, is based on the average prices of five food types observed at selected hawker centres, food courts and coffee shops. The Government does not regulate the prices of food sold in coffee shops, food courts or hawker centres.  Nevertheless, my Ministry ensures that affordable food options are available at all our hawker centres, including those in new estates. To moderate stall rentals and prevent rent-seeking behaviour, my Ministry has disallowed the subletting of stalls. We have also removed the reserve rent in our monthly stall tender exercises. This means that even if the bidding price for these vacant stalls is below market price, the National Environment Agency (NEA) will allocate the vacant stall to the highest bidder as long as there are competitive bids. About 40% of cooked food stalls have been awarded at bids that are below 85% of the assessed market rent.To assist stall holders with rising manpower costs, we are deploying productivity measures, such as centralised dishwashing, automated tray return, e-payment options, and kitchen automation in our hawker centres. These initiatives will reduce the workload of the hawkers and allow them to focus on food preparation and cooking, especially during peak hours. In addition, NEA has approved more than a hundred applications (worth about $214,000) since the Hawkers’ Productivity Grant was launched in October 2017 to assist hawkers adopt stall-level productivity measures. Those who have benefited from the grant have given feedback that the equipment helps to reduce food preparation time significantly. The availability of numerous stalls allows consumers to compare food prices and take into account affordability in their purchase decisions at hawker centres. This also helps to moderate the increase in food prices.We are committed to upholding the role of hawker centres as community dining rooms in both mature and new estates so that Singaporeans from all walks of life can enjoy food at affordable prices. We announced in 2015 that 20 new hawker centres with approximately 800 stalls will be built by 2027. Some of these new hawker centres will be located in new towns such as Sengkang, Tampines and Sembawang. The managing agents appointed to run these new centres will be required to provide affordable food options. An example is Hawker Centre @ Our Tampines Hub (OTH), where hawkers selling local food offer at least one meal option priced at $2.80 or less.'},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M:  The National Environment Agency (NEA) is evaluating the use of male Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti mosquitoes (Wolbachia-Aedes) to further suppress the Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in the community. Phase 1 field study was conducted at three selected sites at Braddell Heights, Tampines West and Nee Soon East from October 2016 to December 2017. The study had met its objectives and demonstrated that the released male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes had successfully competed with urban male mosquitoes and mated with some female mosquitoes. The releases led to 50% suppression of the urban Aedes aegypti mosquito population at the study sites.The field study surfaced two challenges posed by Singapore’s high-density and high-rise landscape. First, NEA discovered that mosquitoes moved from surrounding areas into the study sites, thus reducing the impact of Wolbachia-Aedes in the sites. Second, NEA found higher Aedes aegypti mosquito densities at high floors of some blocks, as insufficient numbers of male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes had reached those floors. To address the high-density and high-rise challenges, NEA is carrying out Phase 2 field study from April 2018 to January 2019. Phase 2 field study will improve the release methodologies to distribute the male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes to where they are needed. NEA will release Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitos at same Phase 1 study sites at Tampines West and Nee Soon East and their extended areas. Phase 2 field study is an important and necessary step for NEA to refine the release methodologies and address the unique challenges faced due to our urban landscape, in preparation for the subsequent suppression trial.NEA will continue to engage residents and stakeholders. The co-operation and support from residents and local stakeholders were crucial in ensuring the success of Phase 1 study. Residents and local stakeholders are encouraged to continue supporting NEA in Phase 2 field study. Residents are also encouraged to continue carrying out mosquito control procedures and the 5-step Mozzie Wipeout.  '},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Ong Ye Kung:  Given the opportunities in Southeast Asia, it is useful for students to develop a good understanding of the region. Students will also benefit from establishing networks within the region early. To raise awareness and understanding of the region, students are introduced to ASEAN in primary school. Through the Social Studies curriculum, students will learn about the cultural and economic ties member countries share with one another. In secondary school, students can offer subjects such as Economics, Geography, History, and Social Studies, which include a deeper understanding of the region. Through Economics, Geography and History at the pre-university level, students learn about the economic and trade policies of Southeast Asian countries, trends in regional economic developments, as well as economic integration through ASEAN.Students extend their understanding of Southeast Asia through ASEAN-themed forums and seminars. They observe ongoing economic developments and expand their understanding of the region when they undertake overseas trips to Southeast Asian countries. In addition, our student-athletes also forge friendships with their fellow athletes from the different Southeast Asian countries through the ASEAN Schools Games.Our Institutions of Higher Learning organize immersion programmes, student exchanges with institutions in the region, and overseas internships.

       "  'answer': 'Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M:  NEA monitors air quality in Singapore through a network of real-time monitoring stations. Besides monitoring key air pollutants such as sulphur dioxide and fine particulate matter (PM2.5), these stations also monitor Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). VOCs are often associated with the handling and combustion of fuel oil.In the event of major fires, in addition to SCDF being activated, NEA officers will be deployed to monitor air and water quality in the vicinity of the affected premises during and after the incident.In the case of the Pulau Busing fire on 20 March 2018, the fire occurred at an oil storage tank operated by M/s PB Tankers Ltd. NEA officers monitored the ambient air quality and meteorological conditions while SCDF and the Company’s Emergency Response Team (CERT) were fighting the fire. The prevailing winds then were blowing from the northeast and the air quality was in the “Good to Moderate” range, with no spikes in the PM2.5, sulphur dioxide, VOCs, and other air pollutant levels. The firefighting water was contained within the bund of the affected oil storage tank and the coastal water quality around Pulau Busing was not affected.As for the fire incident that occurred at No.11 Kranji Crescent on 22 March 2018, NEA officers monitored air and water quality near the affected premises during and after the incident, and did not detect any spikes in the air or water pollutant levels.'},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Ong Ye Kung:  As part of our national curriculum, schools emphasise the values of respect, resilience, responsibility, integrity, care and harmony in classroom lessons, through co-curricular activities and experiential activities like the Values in Action (VIA) programme. Topics such as filial piety, caring for others and importance of saving are covered in subjects such as Character and Citizenship Education (CCE).Schools also work with parents and the community in reinforcing values education. Schools encourage parents to build on what is taught in schools at home. Schools also work with community partners for students to live out the core values through age-appropriate experiential learning. By engaging with the elderly through VIA for example, students better understand their needs and the role they can play to make a difference.Schools review their programs regularly on the effectiveness of the curriculum in inculcating values.

       "  'answer': 'Mr Desmond Lee:  Keeping children safe from sexual abuse requires a whole-of-society effort. There are established inter-agency protocols, services, and programmes to support victims and their families, and to bring perpetrators to justice.When children experience or are suspected of having experienced sexual abuse, the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) and the Singapore Police Force (SPF) will step in. Children who are not safe at home may be placed temporarily with relatives, a foster family, or a children’s home. These children and their families are also supported with a range of community services, and may be referred to MSF psychologists to help them recover from the trauma of abuse. Each child is affected differently by the abuse, and the intervention will be tailored according to the different risks and needs of the child and the family. MSF is constantly looking at ways to improve the assessment and evidence-based intervention for our clients, in line with international practices.Concurrently, suspected perpetrators will be investigated by the SPF. The child plays an important role in the investigation. To reduce the trauma faced by child victims from having to travel to different locations and recounting the incident to different professionals, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and MSF will be piloting a one-stop, multi-disciplinary approach at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital.Perpetrators of child abuse may be charged under the Penal Code, or the Children and Young Persons Act. At the same time, their longer term rehabilitation is needed to prevent the abuse from recurring. The Court can order the perpetrator, who may be a parent or guardian, to undergo counselling, assessments, treatments, or other programmes.Upstream prevention of child abuse and self-protection is equally important. Children are taught about personal safety in schools. They are taught to recognise sexual abuse and harassment, acquire skills to protect themselves both in real life and online, and understand the laws that protect them in Singapore. They also learn to seek help from trusted adults, such as their parents, teachers and school counsellors when there is risk of their personal safety being compromised.Beyond the existing multi-agency network of help, members of the public can also play their part. Noticing child abuse and bringing it to attention is the first step that enables the range of support services to kick in. Anyone who is aware of a child being or at risk of being abused, can help by alerting a community-based Child Protection Specialist Centre, MSF’s Child Protective Service, the ComCare Hotline 1800- 222-0000 or their nearest Family Service Centre.

       "  'answer': 'Mrs Josephine Teo:  When applying for Work Permits (WPs), employers are required to declare key salary terms, including the basic and fixed monthly salary, offered to prospective Work Permit Holders (WPHs). Since 2011, these terms have been reflected in the In-Principle Approval (IPA) letter, which is available in the WPHs’ native languages, and must be sent by the employer to the worker in his home country prior to the worker’s departure to Singapore. This ensures that the worker is fully aware and accepts the terms of conditions before leaving his home country.In some cases, employers may discover that the WPH’s performance falls below what is expected, and thus cannot justify paying the agreed salary. Instead of terminating the WPH’s contract, MOM allows employers to revise the salary downwards, provided they have obtained the worker’s written agreement and have notified MOM of the revision. In the past three years, MOM was notified of salary reductions affecting less than 2 percent of non-domestic WPHs per year.We have taken action against employers who reduced salaries without informing MOM or obtaining the WPH’s written consent. In the first half of 2018, a total of $105,000 in Administrative Financial Penalties were imposed on 17 errant employers.Notwithstanding these safeguards, we have been monitoring salary disputes involving IPA salary reduction. The proportion of WPH salary claims which involve IPA salary reductions was stable at about 7% over the last 3 years, but increased to about 11% in the second half of last year.Since February 2018, when mediating salary disputes, the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM) has insisted that employers provide documented evidence that the worker has consented to any salary reduction. TADM no longer allows for arguments from employers that the worker had provided tacit or verbal consent. In addition, MOM is considering the possibility of disallowing downward salary revisions altogether. While this will provide workers with more certainty of their wage for the entire duration of their stay in Singapore, it could also lead to possible early termination of employment even when the worker is willing to accept a lower wage. We will thus consult with relevant stakeholders to determine the best step forward.'},\n",
       " 871: {'title': 'self-harm cases involving children aged 14 and below',\n",
       "  'question': 'Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) whether there has been an increase in the number of children aged 14 and below involved in self-harm cases; (b) how these cases came to be reported; and (c) what assistance was rendered to the children and their families.',\n",
       "  'answer': 'Mr Desmond Lee:  Self-harm typically occurs in private. The child’s injury may come to the attention of others when there are observable scars or medical attention is required.In school, students are taught healthy ways of coping with stress and personal difficulties, and are encouraged to seek help from trusted adults. They are also taught to look out for and support one another and to alert their teacher or school counsellor if their friends encounter difficulties. Students who self-harm would be referred to school counsellors for help. For complex cases, school counsellors would refer them for further assessment and intervention by medical doctors, clinical psychologists, or other relevant specialists. The number of students aged 14 and below who have been referred for school counselling over the past three years has been small with no significant increase.Self-harm cases may also present at hospitals for treatment of physical injuries. Over the past three years, the number of hospital admissions for self-inflicted injuries among children aged 14 years and below was 42 in 2015, 37 in 2016 and 30 in 2017. These children would be treated for their physical injuries and provided with counselling and psychological support to empower them with other forms of coping techniques.Mental well-being is important in enabling our children to manage stress well. As the causes of self-harm are often complex and multi-faceted, we take a holistic approach to support children with self-harming behaviour, as well as their families. Families and children with psycho-social issues are referred directly to professionals, or community touch points such as Family Service Centres (FSCs) so that they can receive appropriate help to deal with the issues and achieve greater resilience. MSF’s Social Service Offices help FSCs to coordinate with various government agencies to ensure appropriate support for clients and work through the potential stressors on the family.'},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mrs Josephine Teo:  Employment Agencies (EAs) that bring in Foreign Domestic Workers (FDWs) are required, under their licence, to upkeep and maintain the FDWs prior to their deployment to their employers’ households. This includes the provision of food, medical treatment and proper accommodation at the agencies’ cost.EAs have to comply with the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) and Housing & Development Board (HDB) occupancy load criteria. EAs must also ensure that the FDWs have privacy and hygienic living conditions. The places of accommodation used by EAs must be registered with MOM.MOM regularly inspects the places of accommodation and may interview the occupants as part of the process. Over 100 premises are inspected every year. The majority of the EAs have been found to be compliant. Violations were detected for 33 EAs out of 131 EAs whose premises were inspected in the past 12 months, but most were also relatively minor.

       "  'answer': 'Mrs Josephine Teo:  The CPF system has a progressive interest rate structure that provides a higher effective interest rate to CPF members with lower balances.Balances in the Ordinary Account earn 2.5% per annum, while those in the Special Account, Retirement Account, and Medisave Account earn 4% per annum. On top of this, an Extra Interest of 1% is paid on the first $60,000 of combined CPF balances. CPF members aged 55 and above also receive an Additional Extra Interest of 1% on the first $30,000 of their combined CPF balances. Therefore, CPF members with lower balances are earning a higher effective interest rate per annum on their CPF savings.The Government also provides CPF top-ups to help low-wage Singaporeans build up their retirement savings, via the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) Scheme. For example, eligible low-wage employees aged 45 to 54 receive up to $2,200 of WIS payouts a year, comprising of 60% in CPF top-ups and 40% in cash. Older workers receive even higher WIS payouts. In total, more than $650 million in WIS payouts were paid to over 400,000 low-wage workers in 2017, of which more than $400 million were credited into their CPF accounts.'},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mr Ong Ye Kung: We have a carefully planned curriculum, starting from lower primary and to upper secondary, to impart to our students the awareness and skills to protect themselves from sexual exploitation and abuse. For example, in lower primary, students are taught how to differentiate between a good and bad touch; in upper primary, they learn things like how to protect themselves from sexual advances, setting clear physical boundaries in a relationship, and the double-edged nature of the Internet. In secondary school, they learn more about the usefulness and dangers of cyberspace, dealing with relationships, and differentiating between healthy relationship and sexual grooming, etc. All these aim towards inculcating in our students a strong sense of the right to be treated with respect, to protect themselves, to not feel guilty or shame if they are victims, and seek help and counsel. Parents too play a key role in their children's sexuality education. The schools support parents with information on what their children are learning about sexuality and also offer parenting advice on how to initiate discussions on sexuality issues at home. We encourage parents to be open in discussing their beliefs and values, and being available to guide their children on sexuality matters.We understand the member is concerned about this issue and wishes to know the number of cases of sexual offences every year. Our numbers are low by international standards. We monitor the numbers but have not been releasing them. Instead, we are raising awareness through education, counsel and advice in schools and within families. Our teachers are trained to look out for signs of distress in students and refer them to the school counsellors or other professional support when necessary. Suspected cases of statutory rape and predatory sexual behaviours involving a parent, carer or other household member are reported to the Ministry of Social and Family Development's Child Protection Service. When cases involve non-household members, parents will be advised to report to the police. If parents refuse to do so, the schools will make the report. However, it is sometimes difficult for schools to track such cases as parents may not keep the schools informed, and the outcomes of the police investigation may not be made known to schools. \"},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Chan Chun Sing: The Committee on the Future Economy (CFE) had identified the key global and structural shifts, as well as rapid technological changes and growing sentiments against globalisation that would impact us, in developing a comprehensive set of recommendations to guide our economic strategy for the next five to 10 years. Given this, our key economic restructuring efforts will be centred on strengthening enterprise capabilities, building strong digital capabilities, deepening the skills of Singaporeans, and continuing to work together with other economies to stay open and connected, build stronger links, and collaborate closely to boost growth and competitiveness. One of the recommendations of the CFE was the development of Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs), which are industry-specific roadmaps that organise our economic restructuring efforts. The ITMs were developed through an integrated and coordinated tripartite approach, that brought together key stakeholders. We have since launched ITMs for each of the 23 ITM sectors, which together cover 80 percent of the Singapore economy. Each ITM is tailored to the opportunities, needs, and challenges of specific sectors. Some sectors, such as those in the Manufacturing and Modern Services clusters will focus on growth and strengthening their competitive edge, while other sectors such as those in the Lifestyle and Built Environment clusters will be transforming for higher productivity and better jobs. There will be bright spots within every sector The ITMs are dynamic plans that will be updated to respond to changes in the economic environment. We will continue to monitor the progress of our ITMs, refining strategies where necessary to ensure they stay relevant as new trends emerge. Ultimately, the success of our economic restructuring efforts depends on the collective efforts of all stakeholders. Besides the Government, which will serve as an enabler to support this transformation, our trade association and chambers (TACs) and unions also have a key role to galvanise firms of every size, and mobilise workers in every sector, to be part of this transformation journey.

       "  'answer': \"Mr Chan Chun Sing: The US announced a series of safeguard measures in the form of tariffs on solar panels and washing machines under Section 201 of the 1974 Trade Act in January 2018, as well as steel and aluminium under Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act in March 2018.In 2017, Singapore's domestic exports to the US was S$228.9 million for solar cells and modules, and S$36,000 for washing machines. Domestic exports to the US totalled S$4.6 million for steel, and S$7.1 million for aluminium. In aggregate, these exports made up 1.4% of Singapore’s total domestic exports to the US, and a smaller 0.09% of Singapore’s total domestic exports to the world.The US tariffs have the effect of making the prices of these products more expensive to US importers, which may reduce their demand for overseas products. Given the modest share that the products affected by the US tariffs have as a percentage of Singapore's total domestic exports, the direct negative impact of the US tariffs on the Singapore economy is limited.Nonetheless, we are closely monitoring developments on these safeguard measures, which do impact some companies in Singapore. Singapore has registered our concerns with the relevant US departments and consulted with the US on possible exemption from the safeguard measures.As a small and open economy, having free and connected markets is critical for Singapore. It is important that Singapore and like-minded partners uphold the rules-based multilateral trading system, and ensure that such safeguard measures do not become entrenched and turn into barriers to trade. Even as Singapore continues to build stronger links and collaborate closely with our trading partners to boost growth and create jobs, we will continue to safeguard our trade interests and resist protectionist practices which could disrupt the flow of global commerce. \"},\n",

From 2013 to 2017, over 3,400 companies employing about 368,000 workers have benefited from WorkPro grants. We have continuously enhanced the WorkPro scheme. In 2016, we raised the maximum grant for the JRG from $150,000 to $300,000 per company to further facilitate job redesign efforts. To encourage more capability development projects to incorporate the requirements of older workers, JRG can be applied as a rider on top of other Government grants. Since the enhancement, and with additional effort to promote the scheme, the number of companies that benefitted from the JRG has increased from about 30 a year to about 440 a year.WorkPro funding is only disbursed when we are satisfied that the company has achieved the corresponding grant deliverables and is able to demonstrate the impact to their employees. Companies claiming for the AMG and JRG are required to submit evaluations of how projects undertaken have created a positive impact on their older employees. Similarly, under the WLG, companies claiming the Developmental Grant (DG) are required to submit evaluation reports on their FWA pilot projects, in addition to formalising these FWAs in the companies' HR policy to be offered to all other employees.

MOH does not routinely monitor the health effects from exposure to phthalate among male infants, but we monitor global data and studies on the impact of exposure to phthalates on an ongoing basis. The findings of some studies have suggested that there is some potential for harm in humans, particularly when ingested, although the evidence is not conclusive. Nevertheless, Singapore has established regulations, based on international standards, to reduce exposure to phthalates as a precautionary measure.Enterprise Singapore regulates the use of phthalates in general consumer goods under the Consumer Protection (Consumer Goods Safety Requirements) Regulations (CGSR). The Regulations are aligned with applicable international, regional or national safety standards, and Enterprise Singapore monitors compliance through post-market surveillance. Additional regulatory requirements are imposed for toys and childcare articles in particular, including that on allowable concentrations of specified phthalates.

       "  'answer': 'Mr Lawrence Wong: The Parking app has been implemented for all coupon-based car parks, for cars on 1 October 2017, and all other vehicle types on 20 December 2017. Since its launch, more than 2 million parking sessions have been logged by about 250,000 vehicles.The Parking.sg app serves to complement the existing Electronic Parking System (EPS), rather than to replace it. The app offers greater convenience to motorists parking in areas where EPS is not feasible due to site constraints, for example, kerbside parking lots by URA and HDB.We will continue to enhance the Parking.sg app for better user experience and improve its accessibility. Some of the enhancements that have already been incorporated include the addition of parking history, and the notification feature that alerts the user before the parking session expires.The Parking.sg app currently shows the motorist where the nearest car parks are located, but does not display the availability of the parking lots. This is because the lots may be occupied by some motorists using coupons, which we are unable to ascertain today. However, we are continuing to encourage more motorists to switch from coupons to the Parking.sg app, and as more do so over time, it will possible to incorporate this feature into future enhancements of the app.'},\n",

Singapore’s Gini coefficient is typically reported based on household income from work per household member. The calculation by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is based on the Square Root Scale4.If we apply the OECD method to ourselves, then based on data from the latest available year, the Gini coefficients for Singapore and some major economies are shown in Chart 1.Before taxes and transfers, Singapore’s Gini coefficient is low compared with many major developed economies.After taxes and transfers, several countries have a lower Gini coefficient compared to Singapore. This is because they typically impose higher overall taxes on the working population and in particular on the middle-income, in order to finance large social transfers. In contrast, Singapore’s approach is to keep our tax burden low, and provide targeted support for the lower-income.In addition, these calculations do not reflect the full range of Government policy interventions that are unique to the Singapore context.

We must therefore ensure that our system is rigorous in only assisting those who wish to pursue meritorious cases but cannot afford to do so.For matrimonial disputes, the following provisions are in place to assist applicants first, where the spouses are estranged, LAB excludes the income of the applicant’s spouse when assessing the applicant’s means. Second, in a divorce case, the matrimonial property would not be included in the means assessment.Moreover, for family proceedings involving children or protection order applications between spouses or ex-spouses, the Director of Legal Aid can give an extra deduction for the disposable capital component of the means test.

       "  'answer': 'Mr Lim Swee Say: The national Jobs Bank has been designed to reduce the likelihood of having job postings that are inaccurate or advertise for positions that do not exist. Employers have to be Singapore-registered companies and provide their Unique Entity Number (UEN) to post jobs on Jobs Bank for accountability. Similarly, jobseekers apply for jobs only after logging in via SingPass. This creates an environment where jobseekers and employers can search for matches confidently.Jobs Bank users may also, at the click of a button, report to Workforce Singapore (WSG) regarding Jobs Bank advertisements which contain false information. Upon receiving such cases, WSG will work with the relevant agencies to investigate and where necessary, take action against the company responsible for the job advertisement.Jobseekers who choose to use other internet-based job portals are advised to select reputable sites where job advertisements are more likely to be authentic and accurately-described. While the Ministry of Manpower does not license Internet-based job portals, the advertising of fake jobs with criminal intent, such as cheating, may be subject to penalties under the Penal Code.'},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Lim Swee Say: The Employment Act (EA) stipulates certain core provisions and working conditions for employees. We regularly review the EA to keep pace with the changing labour force profile and employment landscape.Domestic workers, including Foreign Domestic Workers (FDWs), are not covered by the EA. This is because given the personalized nature of domestic work, it is not practical to regulate certain aspects of their work, such as hours of work and work on public holidays as we do in the EA. This has not changed.The vast majority of domestic workers in Singapore are live-in FDWs whose rights and well-being are protected under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (EFMA). In recognition that FDWs can be vulnerable as most of them work alone and they live-in with their employers, the EFMA stipulates relevant provisions as found in the EA such as prompt payment of salary and rest days, as well as enhanced protections including requirements for employers to provide food and proper accommodation with adequate space and privacy.Domestic workers who encounter issues with their employers should approach MOM for advice and assistance as soon as possible.'},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Lawrence Wong: In the planning of mature estates such as Dakota Crescent, we have to find a balance between preserving the built heritage and identity of the area, and injecting new facilities and homes to rejuvenate the precinct.To understand what was important to the community, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) engaged the Grassroots Advisor, Grassroots Leaders, community and heritage interest groups, residents, and other relevant stakeholders. A common feedback was that the central courtyard, where the Dove Playground was located, holds special meaning for the residents as it was where they used to gather.The central courtyard includes a cluster of six blocks which contains all the distinctive building typologies and architectural features of the Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT) flats found in the estate. Hence the decision to keep the central courtyard and the six blocks.We have received suggestions for the central cluster of buildings to be put to civic and institutional-related uses.

The Ministry of Manpower takes a serious view of employers who collect kickbacks from WPHs. Employers found to do so are liable for a fine up to $30,000, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years, or to both.Since 2005, WPHs from the Construction sector have been allowed to change employers if their current employers agree. In 2015, Construction WPHs were also allowed to change employers near their work pass expiry if they are unable to come to a mutual agreement on the renewal of their work permits.

       "  'answer': 'Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The water pipe leak at Somerset Road on 16 January 2018 was due to stress to the pipe caused by uneven soil settlement. We have isolated the leaking section of the pipe and put the rest of the pipeline back in service. The affected stretch of pipeline is in the process of being replaced under PUB’s Pipeline Renewal Programme.As part of its operation and maintenance regime, PUB carries out checks for leaks on its entire pipe network at least once a year, or more frequently where necessary. The pipe at Somerset Road, which is made of cast iron and laid in 1973, was last checked for leaks in December 2017, with no leak found. We have not observed any correlation between rainfall and the number of leaks.When leaks occur, PUB seeks to fix them in the shortest time possible as permitted by site conditions while minimising the disruption to customers and the public. PUB officers need time to identify the pipe and the valves that need to be shut so as to isolate the leak, identify the customers who are potentially affected, and set up the appropriate alternative supply provisions. For the leak at Somerset Road, temporary supply connections to these customers were set up in tandem with the repair works to limit the disruption to public. The repair works had to proceed carefully due to the need to minimise road closures and the presence of several other buried services belonging to the electrical and telecommunications companies near the site. PUB worked together with these companies to ensure that its repair works did not affect other critical services.To reduce the risk of pipe leaks, including those caused by uneven soil settlement, PUB has been laying pipes made of more resilient materials such as ductile iron and steel, and has adopted enhanced pipe-laying practices such as pipe bedding for better pipe support. Furthermore, we have put in place regulations to ensure that contractors take proper measures to prevent damage to our pipelines during construction activities.Besides these measures, PUB proactively replaces older pipes or pipes which are in less satisfactory condition under its Pipeline Renewal Programme and is targeting to replace 50 km of such pipes this year, a 20 km increase from last year.'},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr K Shanmugam: Losing an Identity Card (IC) is a serious matter as the lost IC may be misused to commit identity fraud and for illicit transactions.In the last three years, the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) received around 31,500 reports of lost ICs annually. Around 13% were granted fee waivers for the replacement ICs.The trend of lost ICs has been relatively stable over the past decade.There is no fixed qualifying criteria for the waiver of the IC replacement fee. ICA will consider the circumstances of each case. It may grant a waiver in situations where it assesses that the loss of the IC was not due to negligence, but circumstances beyond the cardholder’s control, for example, if he or she had been a victim of crime.

       "  'answer': 'Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): The Public Service strives to adopt a customer-centric approach in dealing with feedback and requests from members of the public. The No Wrong Door (NWD) policy and the First Responder Protocol (FRP) were introduced as part of many efforts to ensure that feedback from the public are addressed quickly and effectively. Under NWD, the agency that receives feedback on an issue not under its purview should identify the agency responsible and ensure that the agency will take up the case, before putting that agency in touch with the person who provided the feedback. If the issue has no clear owner, the agency that receives the feedback will apply FRP and identify an agency with some domain expertise. This latter agency, also known as the First Responder, will promptly resolve the inter-agency request, while the back-end policy and operational issues are being sorted out.Public officers at the frontline are trained on these protocols. The Civil Service College conducts regular case simulation workshops for frontline teams, to familiarise officers with the procedures and standards. Many large agencies include these requirements as part of their service training programmes, and have also developed innovations to enhance seamlessness. For example, the CPF Board has an internal virtual assistant to help officers provide accurate answers to members\\' CPF queries and identify the right contacts to help them. Agencies are audited on a regular basis on their compliance with the procedures and service standards.The Municipal Services Office (MSO), established in 2014 to coordinate municipal issues that span across multiple agencies, is an example of how the Public Service has moved from \"No Wrong Door\" to \"Just One Door\". Its OneService app allows members of the public to provide feedback on all municipal issues without having to know which agency is in charge. This is made possible by a backend routing system that allows seamless case referral between agencies based on parameters such as land, issue and asset ownership.MSO has also worked with partner agencies to establish First Responders in different domains. For example, MSO has brought PUB and the Town Councils together to determine who should serve as the First Responder in different types of water-related issues, so that residents no longer have to face multiple site inspections from both PUB and their Town Council. Other First Responders include LTA for the maintenance of connectivity-related infrastructure like park connectors, footpaths, and footbridges, NParks for public greenery maintenance, AVA for animal-related issues, and NEA for public cleanliness. There are also escalation mechanisms to ensure complex cases or cases with unclear ownership are escalated to the appropriate authorities for prompt action. Collectively, these mechanisms strengthen agencies’ practice of NWD and FRP in the delivery of municipal services.'},\n",

Last year, more than 1,800 locals were placed through these programmes. Among those placed, about 5% were previously retrenched or LTU.As both PCPs and PnT programmes are structured such that every jobseeker is hired by an employer before undergoing training, every worker on these programmes would have successfully secured a job.

       "  'answer': 'Mr Lim Swee Say: Under the Adapt and Grow initiative, the Professional Conversion Programmes (PCPs) and Place-and-Train (PnT) programmes help PMETs and Rank and File RnF workers address job-skills mismatches respectively.PCPs provide training and salary support to help mid-career PMETs reskill, so that they can move into new and different occupations or sectors that have good prospects and opportunities for progression. Over the past one year, more than 3,300 local PMETs were placed. Among those placed, about 10% were previously retrenched or unemployed for 6 months or more, that is, Long Term Unemployed (LTU).Similarly, PnT programmes provide training and salary support to help RnF workers reskill to take on new jobs in different sectors. Last year, more than 1,800 locals were placed through these programmes. Among those placed, about 5% were previously retrenched or LTU.As both PCPs and PnT programmes are structured such that every jobseeker is hired by an employer before undergoing training, every worker on these programmes would have successfully secured a job. Applicants who are unable to secure employment and hence do not get into these programmes are being assisted through other programmes. For example, the Career Support Programme (CSP) provides salary support to encourage employers to hire mid-career PMETs who have been retrenched or are LTU.

According to the Ministry of Manpower (MOM)'s Conditions of Employment Survey 2016, 19% of employers1 provided paid parental care leave for employees to take care of their parents when sick in 2016, up from 6% in 2008.The Government encourages employers to provide more family-friendly practices, including family-related leave benefits, via a few ways. First, the Civil Service has introduced two days of parent care leave per year. Around four in 10 civil servants utilised the parent care leave in 2016.Second, MOM's Work-Life Grant funds each company up to $160,000 over four years to implement Flexible Work Arrangements (FWAs)2 to help employees better manage work and family responsibilities, which may include caregiving for aged parents.Third, MOM also launched the Tripartite Standard on FWAs in October 2017 to encourage more employers to publicly commit to offering FWAs in their companies.

       "  'answer': 'Mr Lim Swee Say: Under the Retirement and Re-employment Act (RRA), employers are required to offer eligible employees re-employment till age 67. Since re-employment was introduced in 2012, over 98% of private-sector local employees who wished to continue working at age 62 were offered re-employment. The number of disputes related to re-employment has remained low for the past five years, at about 40 each year. Most cases were resolved through mediation, with less than four cases on average each year which proceeded to adjudication. These cases contain a mix of situations where the dispute arose due to a misunderstanding of the law by the employer, or by the employee.MOM has in place a number of measures to increase the employability of older workers and encourage employers to hire older workers. The Special Employment Credit (SEC) scheme provides a wage offset of up to 8% of monthly wages to employers when they hire older workers. An additional wage offset of up to 3% of monthly wages is also provided to encourage continued employment of older workers aged 65 and above. Reduced employer CPF contribution rates for employees aged 55 and above further help to moderate the costs of hiring older workers for employers. Under the WorkPro scheme, employers can receive government funding support of up to $320,000 per company to implement age management practices and redesign workplaces and processes to create easier, safer and smarter jobs for older workers.As mindset change is also needed to improve the employability of older workers, TAFEP runs campaigns to raise awareness of the value that older workers bring to the workforce and encourage employers to tap on their skills and experience.In June 2017, unemployment rate of older residents aged 60 and over in the labour force remained low at 3.3%. MOM actively supports them through the Adapt and Grow Initiative. This includes Career Matching services, as well as programmes to help workers overcome wage and skill mismatches. In particular, the Career Support Programme encourages employers to hire experienced, mature PMETs, especially the long-term unemployed, by providing them with salary support. Mature PMETs can tap on the higher wage and training support under the Professional Conversion Programmes to reskill, so that they can move into new occupations and sectors with good prospects and progression. Mature rank-and-file workers can also tap on wage and training support under Work Trial and other Place-and-Train/Train-and-Place programmes offered by WSG and NTUC-e2i.Our various programmes to improve the employability of older workers have been showing encouraging results. The employment rate of residents aged 55-64 has increased from 61.2% in 2011 to 67.3% in 2016. This compares favourably with developed economies, with Singapore ranked 9th against 35 OECD countries in 2016.

These accidents occurred on public paths, or at road junctions when PMD riders were crossing the road, or on roads when PMD riders were riding parallel to vehicle traffic illegally. Over the same period, LTA and the Traffic Police issued warnings or summonses to about 330 riders for the offence of riding PMDs on roads. (We do not have comprehensive figures for accidents involving PMDs prior to 2017.)LTA has increased its outreach efforts to raise awareness of the danger of riding PMDs on roads. These include installing more than 500 signages at hotspots to warn PMD riders to stay off the roads.LTA will also be strengthening its penalty regime to deter riding of PMDs on roads. With effect from 15 January 2018, the current composition sum of $100 will be increased to $300 and $500 for offenders who ride on local and major roads respectively. Offenders who ride on the expressways will be charged in court. Repeat offenders will face stiffer penalties, including court action. If convicted, offenders face a fine of up to $2,000 or imprisonment of up to three months, or both.As PMD riders are not allowed on roads, and have to abide by speed limits of 15km/h on footpaths and 25 km/h on shared and cycling paths, we do not require them to wear helmets. However, we encourage PMD riders to take personal responsibility and use the necessary protective gear while riding.

       "  'answer': \"Mr Desmond Lee: The number of households assisted each year on either ComCare Short-to-Medium-Term Assistance (SMTA) or Long-Term Assistance (LTA) has generally increased over the past five years, with a slight decrease for those assisted on SMTA in FY2016 compared to FY2015.This could be due to several factors, such as the widening of the ComCare eligibility criteria in 2012 and 2014, greater awareness and accessibility to social assistance through the network of 24 Social Service Offices which was rolled out between 2013 and 2015, and demographic changes.The proportion of older SMTA main applicants (aged 55 to 64) increased from 18% in FY2012 to 23% in FY2016. The proportion of those who were not working also increased from 48% in FY2012 to 53% in FY2016. Most of those who were not working were either medically unfit to work, or retired. The increase in proportion of SMTA main applicants who are older, medically unfit to work or retired corresponds with demographic trends such as shrinking family sizes and an ageing population.The Government will continue to provide multiple layers of assistance for the lower-income and vulnerable through a network of government agencies and community groups. There are many schemes in place addressing specific needs across various domains such as financial needs, healthcare, housing, education, employment and retirement adequacy. Together, these schemes provide substantial support to those in need.We will continue to refine and enhance our policies and approach to social service delivery, so that the low-income and vulnerable will get the support they require to cover their basic needs. But even as the Government does more, we must be careful not to erode the strong work ethic and sense of individual responsibility and self-reliance, which have been key factors underpinning Singapore's growth as a society and nation. We must also be careful not to diminish the role of the family and the community, where they are able to provide or contribute to the care and support for individuals who are disadvantaged or vulnerable.Today, there are many ground-up initiatives in the community, and many citizens are already giving and contributing. For example, there are community groups who reach out, befriend and support various vulnerable groups such as low-income families with children and the elderly who live alone. The Government will continue to engage and partner the community to support such vulnerable groups. Through the SG Cares movement, we hope to mobilise volunteers and bring partners with different skills and resources to work with us in caring for those in need.The Government also looks continually at how we can enhance client-centricity in service delivery. There are ongoing efforts to tighten inter-agency referral processes and facilitate data-sharing with other agencies. We are also exploring the potential for more integrated service delivery and co-location of complementary services so that our clients can access more holistic assistance and become self-reliant again.\"},\n",

Through the use of real-world examples and authentic case studies, students are engaged in class discussions that enable them to analyse how economic decisions are made, consider multiple perspectives in decision-making and recognise consequences arising from decisions made. For example, students discuss the thinking behind the Singapore Budget, and the possible impact of the budget on individuals, firms and the economy.The Singapore Student Learning Space, which is the MOE online learning platform that is being developed, includes case studies and resources that reflect real-world contexts. For example, Economics lesson packages on how pricing of goods and services such as sugary beverages and private-hire rides influence consumer behaviour and expenditure are available on this learning platform.Where appropriate, Curriculum Open-access Resources in Economics (CORE) can serve as a supplementary resource for incorporation in the Singapore Student Learning Space.'},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The primary role of a Community Volunteer (CV) is to educate environmental offenders to stop the offending acts and encourage greater ownership of the environment.To enable the CVs to perform their role more effectively, they are empowered to request the particulars of offenders who fail to heed their advice. The particulars are sent to the National Environment Agency (NEA) for follow-up action. Since 2016, our CVs have engaged more than 3,500 individuals for environmental offences such as littering in public spaces and smoking in prohibited areas. The vast majority responded positively such as by picking up their litter and hence no further action was taken. A small number of around 60 individuals were non-compliant and therefore subjected to enforcement action by NEA such as summonses and advisory letters.'},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Lawrence Wong: AVA adopts a multi-pronged approach to address noise and nuisance caused by birds roosting in trees. For the case along Upper Serangoon Road, AVA has taken several steps. First, as mentioned by Mr Sitoh, AVA has worked with NParks to prune the trees to discourage birds from roosting in them. Second, AVA conducted a trial in September, using lasers to disperse the birds. AVA is currently assessing the effectiveness of this measure. Third, AVA will continue to work with NEA and the Potong Pasir Town Council to ensure that food waste is properly disposed of. This will reduce food sources for birds and discourage them from roosting nearby. Fourth, AVA will also work with NEA and the Town Council to educate residents not to feed the birds.'},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr K Shanmugam: Raising awareness is one of Traffic Police\\'s (TP) key strategies to enhance road safety.TP introduced the \"Use Your Road Sense\" movement in 2015, to actively reach out to road users. The objective is to influence and shape the right behaviour for better road safety. The outreach targeted not only general road users, but also vulnerable groups such as motorcyclists and elderly pedestrians, and vocational drivers such as taxi and heavy vehicle drivers.TP is also working with LTA to raise awareness concerning the dangers of riding personal mobility devices (PMDs) on the roads. Among others, signs have been installed at hotspots to warn PMD riders to stay off the roads. PMD riders are also reminded of the rules and code of conduct for cycling and the use of PMDs through campaigns and programmes (e.g. Safe Riders Campaign and Safe Cycling Programme), including the safe use of pedestrian crossings (e.g. stopping and looking out for traffic before crossing).The basic driving and riding curricula at the driving schools have been and will continue to be regularly updated to remain relevant as the traffic landscape changes. TP is also leveraging new technology, for example, it will mandate driving and riding simulation training for all learner motorists in 2019. This will enable them to acquire the necessary skills and know-how to react properly in common traffic situations within a safe, controlled environment.To promote continual learning for motorists, TP launched the one-stop Online Learning Portal in July 2017, which allows free public access to the latest driving theory handbooks. The portal will be further enhanced later this year to include animated videos of the top causes of accidents, mock theory tests, and updates on road traffic regulations.In addition, the Safe Driving Course (SDC) was introduced in November 2015, to impart safe driving techniques to motorists who have accumulated a high number of demerit points.TP is also updating the Highway Code to ensure its continued relevance in today’s landscape. The online basic and final theory handbooks will also be periodically reviewed and updated so that the latest information on traffic signs, rules and regulations are made available to the public.'},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Lim Swee Say: To keep strengthening employment support for our local jobseekers, Workforce Singapore (WSG) adopts a multi-provider approach to help them. It runs three career centres, complemented by two more centres operated by NTUC-e2i. In addition, WSG and its predecessor, Workforce Development Agency (WDA), had tapped on private sector employment agencies to provide wider employment outreach for our jobseekers.As unemployment has generally been low, placements done by most employment agencies here have involved mainly passive jobseekers, i.e. persons already in employment who may not be actively searching for jobs. To step up our support for active jobseekers who are unemployed and actively looking for jobs, we did a global search of employment agencies with the business model, experience and expertise suited to help such active jobseekers. We found that partnerships between government and the private sector have been successful in countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia, where private placement providers are contracted to place active jobseekers, including those who may face greater employment barriers. Hence, WSG appointed two of them as our partners so that we can adapt some of their best practices in Singapore for the benefit of our active jobseekers.The two placement providers in the current pilot commenced operations six and eight months ago. Currently, they are still ramping up their operations and have yet to reach steady state. The payment they will receive from WSG will mainly depend on how many jobseekers they are able to place, taking into account the profile of the jobseekers including age and length of unemployment.'},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The GPFirst programme is a pilot scheme first introduced at Changi General Hospital (CGH) in January 2014. GPFirst aims to encourage patients with non-emergency conditions to seek treatment at General Practitioners (GPs) rather than at the Emergency Department (ED). Patients assessed by the participating GPs as requiring ED care are referred to the ED with minimal delay. In recognition that the patient has incurred initial charges at the GP, a $50 subsidy is provided to offset the patient’s ED bill.In 2016, about $1 million was invested in the GPFirst programme at CGH which would include the ED subsidy, expenses on GP engagement initiatives and publicity to raise the awareness of the programme. The programme not only helps to reduce non-emergency cases seen in CGH’s ED, thereby saving unnecessary ED expenses by the hospital and the patients, more importantly, it also enables the ED to focus on attending to patients with critical conditions in a timelier manner. Patients with non-emergency conditions will also benefit from more timely access to care at the GPsand cost savings as the GP charge would typically be less than $50, as compared to $120 if he visits the CGH ED.From CGH's pilot, MOH has concluded that the benefits justify the cost of running the GPFirst scheme. The scheme will be extended to more public hospitals in 2018. This will entail establishing close partnerships with GPs, promoting awareness among residents and learning from CGH's pilot.\"},\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mr Gan Kim Yong: MediShield Life was introduced in November 2015 as a universal healthcare insurance scheme that provides all Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents with lifelong coverage against large healthcare bills.MediShield Life has been successfully implemented. Since its launch, around 300,000 Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents have made successful claims, including around 40,000 who were previously uninsured. Overall claims increased from $758 million in 2016 to $845 million in 2017.To promote better understanding of MediShield Life and its features, roadshows were conducted in partnership with the media and community organisations. These include media advertisements and targeted outreach to seniors through the Pioneer Generation Office and Grassroots Organisations. These efforts have helped to raise public awareness and appreciation for MediShield Life.With Government subsidies and financial assistance from Additional Premium Support, we have achieved a very high compliance rate for payment of MediShield Life premiums. As at end October 2017, about 1% of Singapore Residents have not fully paid their premiums. MOH will continue to work with MSF and CPF Board to follow up with these individuals, and provide assistance to low-income Singaporeans.
