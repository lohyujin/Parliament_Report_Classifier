criteria for setting up hawker centres and wet markets,"Mr Don Wee asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment what are the criteria, such as the number of dwelling units, to set up a hawker centre and wet market within a constituency.","Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: In 2011, the Government announced its intention to restart building hawker centres after a 26-year hiatus, focusing on new estates or existing ones that are relatively under-served in terms of a diversity of affordable dining options. This ensures Singaporeans will continue to have access to affordable food across Singapore. We announced in 2011 and 2015 that we would build twenty new hawker centres in total. Seven are already in operation while another ten are currently in the design development or construction stages and are expected to be completed by 2027. For the remaining three hawker centres, one has earlier been announced to be in Choa Chu Kang Town Centre while the locations of the remaining two will be announced in due course. As we plan for the long term, the National Environment Agency (NEA) assesses the need for new hawker centres to serve towns with larger geographical areas and populations instead of individual constituencies. NEA works closely with planning agencies such as URA and HDB to identify appropriate locations for new hawker centres based on criteria such as residential catchment and availability of affordable and comparable F&B options in the vicinity. For residents’ convenience and to ensure a viable level of business for hawkers, sites with good accessibility and connectivity are also preferred, such as those co-located with other amenities or transport nodes. New hawker centres will generally not come with a market section selling fresh produce given the availability of alternative options such as HDB market produce shops and supermarkets. From our experience, market sections in hawker centres require sufficient scale to succeed, and must attract customers from a broader regional level. Those which are unable to get this catchment generally do not fare well."
reasons for recent surge in dengue cases,Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) what are the reasons for the recent surge in dengue cases; and (b) what are the short- and medium- term measures to reduce overall dengue cases.,"21 Mr Yip Hon Weng asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether the reduction in grass-cutting and tree-pruning activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic has caused the rise in dengue cases in housing estates. 22 Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) what is the number of dengue cases in the past six months; (b) what has been the progress of anti-dengue efforts; and (c) what has been the progress of Project Wolbachia. Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien:  As of 29 August 2020, there were 27,281 dengue cases reported this year. Of these, about 24,000 cases were reported in the past six months, from March to August 2020.A confluence of factors contributed to the surge in dengue cases. First, the less common DENV-3 was dominant in the first four months of this year and remains high. As this serotype had not been prevalent in the last three decades, our population has low herd immunity and this facilitates rapid disease transmission.Second, NEA’s Gravitrap surveillance system detected a 30 per cent increase in the Aedes aegypti mosquito population from May to June 2020, compared to the period February to March 2020. Coupled with the warmer and wetter weather as we entered the traditional peak dengue season from May onwards, the momentum of the high dengue case load sustained the high number of cases seen in June and till today.Third, the spike in dengue cases coincided with the two-month Circuit Breaker (CB) period. The weekly number of dengue cases started to rise sharply from May 2020. With more people staying at home, there were more human targets for the female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.Finally, the scaling back of services for cleaning and facilities maintenance during the CB period, including stoppage of work at construction sites, could have also compounded the dengue situation. In some cases, overgrown grass may have concealed discarded receptables which could become potential breeding sites. However, this issue is being addressed as cleaning and associated services have resumed.NEA has scaled up efforts on all fronts since the end of the CB, working with stakeholders. First, NEA has an intensive inspection regime. Majority of breeding was found in homes. In May and June alone, it carried out 107,000 inspections of homes, and detected and destroyed about 2,600 mosquito breeding habitats. Another 2,700 mosquito breeding habitats were destroyed during inspections of condominium grounds, construction sites, common areas and other premises.Second, to deter mosquito breeding, NEA has tightened the enforcement regime for Town Council managed areas, construction sites, and residential premises since 15 July 2020. For example, NEA has increased composition fine amounts in instances of repeated breeding offences, or multiple breeding habitats detected during a single inspection.Third, on 24 July, NEA launched an intensive vector control exercise with Town Councils, Grassroots Advisers and leaders, and community volunteers. Town councils were called upon to step up housekeeping efforts to keep common areas litter-free, remove stagnant water, maintain drains, as well as work with NEA to conduct coordinated chemical treatment such as fogging, misting and applying larvicide in common areas. Most Town Councils have completed desilting and flushing of drains in the larger dengue clusters, and have moved on to also tackle other areas with high mosquito population. NEA has been auditing Town Councils to ensure that housekeeping efforts are satisfactory. Fourth, NEA has stepped up collaboration with stakeholders on dengue prevention. For example, NEA is working with community partners, such as Grassroots Advisers and Leaders, as well as community volunteers, to reach out to residents with messages on how to prevent mosquito breeding and protect themselves against mosquito bites. Together with the People’s Association and Ministry of Health, 700,000 bottles of repellent were distributed to residents in active dengue clusters and another 300,000 bottles were distributed by Polyclinics and General Practitioners to suspected dengue patients. Recently, NEA partnered the Ministry of Education to provide 46,000 bottles of repellent to students in 37 schools located in large dengue clusters, to protect the students and educate them and their families on how to protect themselves against dengue. Fifth, NEA has launched successive public communications campaigns on both mainstream and online media. NEA has expanded the number of dengue alert banners displayed at neighbourhood precincts of dengue cluster areas, and brought the message closer to residents with dengue alert posters at the individual HDB blocks. Residents living in cluster areas are also receiving SMS reminders to check their homes for stagnant water and do the Mozzie Wipeout.These efforts have borne some initial results. We have seen about a 20% decline in dengue cases in recent weeks. About 84 per cent of the 2,253 clusters reported in 2020 have closed as of 31 August 2020. This includes the large dengue clusters at Bartley Road, Tampines Avenue 7, Cassia Crescent, Dakota Crescent, Leicester Road, Potong Pasir Avenue 1 and Braddell Road. However, the overall number still remains high and we cannot let our guard down.While NEA puts in concerted efforts on dengue control, we are continuing with the Project Wolbachia trials and expanding to new areas. The phased field studies at Yishun and Tampines have been promising, with the Aedes aegypti population being suppressed by 90 per cent. Preliminary analysis has shown that 65 to 80 per cent fewer dengue cases are observed at the study sites, compared to areas without releases. NEA has progressed to Phase 5 of Project Wolbachia in July 2020, which will involve releases for the whole towns of Tampines and Yishun, covering 1,455 blocks or about 15 per cent of all HDB blocks in Singapore. In addition, since May 2020, NEA has been testing a more targeted release strategy in areas with higher risk of dengue in Choa Chu Kang and Bukit Batok towns, to pre-emptively suppress the high Aedes aegypti population in these areas. These releases cover an additional 207 blocks.Despite the success of the trials, Wolbachia is not a silver bullet; nor is it ready for immediate deployment. Constant efforts are still required to find innovations and engineering solutions to automate and sustain the mosquito production and release processes, before Wolbachia can be implemented on a larger scale. More importantly, Wolbachia technology cannot replace the community’s efforts to ensure good housekeeping, which will always be needed to keep our homes and estates free from mosquitoes and dengue.The current conditions are challenging. We are still in the peak dengue season and an all-out national effort is necessary to win the battle against dengue. NEA and partner agencies are committed to do our best to sustain the efforts. I urge all residents, especially those residing in dengue cluster areas, to do their part and take the three protective actions against dengue – spray insecticide in dark corners around the house, apply insect repellent regularly, and wear long sleeves and long pants. Residents should also continue to do the Mozzie Wipeout and ensure that their homes and surroundings are free of stagnant water. "
statistics for covid-19 community testing,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song asked the Minister for Health since 1 May 2020 (a) what percentage of patients have been tested for COVID-19 after presenting symptoms of acute respiratory infection at GP clinics or polyclinics; and (b) what percentage of contacts with prolonged exposure to patients diagnosed with COVID-19 have been tested for the disease.,"15 Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song asked the Minister for Health (a) since 1 June 2020, how many people have been (i) randomly tested for COVID-19 (ii) diagnosed with COVID-19 as a result of random testing; and (b) what are the plans to step up random testing for COVID-19 in the community. 16 Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Health what is the current mean and median lead time between when COVID-19 swab testing is conducted and when the results of the test are made available to relevant parties.Mr Gan Kim Yong: COVID-19 testing is a key enabler in our efforts to fight COVID-19. Our testing strategy is focused on active case finding, as well as targeted surveillance on identified groups. Such testing is based on a holistic and concerted strategy to detect and ring-fence active infections as early as possible to prevent further transmission.The majority of linked cases are detected through active case finding around confirmed cases. Once a case is detected, the Ministry of Health (MOH) will quickly contact-trace all potential close contacts and place them under quarantine. As part of the quarantine process, all persons-under-quarantine (PUQs) will be subjected to a swab polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for COVID-19 at the start and end of the quarantine period. The swab test at the start allows us to quickly identify infected persons under quarantine, provide the appropriate medical support and expand the ring-fence of close contacts if necessary. The swab PCR test at the end will pick up any remaining cases who could have been incubating the virus at the start of his quarantine, and gives us additional assurance that the PUQ is not infectious before releasing him from quarantine. If the PUQ presents with symptoms during his quarantine, he will be tested for COVID-19 immediately.MOH has also conducted special operations to test selected groups of individuals where there is a higher risk of transmission of COVID-19. Examples include the testing of identified households and their visitors at Block 111 Tampines Street 11, and the testing of bus drivers and staff working in public bus depots and interchanges. While the individuals tested were not close contacts of the confirmed cases, targeted deployment of such special testing operations allows earlier detection of any underlying cases among the group even if they are asymptomatic.Beyond active case finding, MOH has put in place targeted surveillance testing in the community. First, PCR testing is provided for all individuals aged 13 and above diagnosed with acute respiratory infection (ARI) at first presentation to a doctor. As clinical and scientific evidence shows that an infected person is most infectious right before and immediately after the start of symptoms, testing all individuals diagnosed with ARI early allows MOH to detect infected individuals quickly to contain further spread. From 1 July 2020 to 16 August 2020, 76% of the patients aged 13 and older diagnosed with ARI at the Polyclinics and Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs) were PCR tested for COVID-19. Of these, a small percentage – 0.03% - tested positive, indicating that the community prevalence of COVID-19 is low. We continue to encourage all individuals who are unwell to seek medical attention immediately and adhere to the medical advice received.As we re-open our borders and facilitate travel, we are also testing incoming travellers either on-arrival or during their Stay-Home Notice period, to detect cases and reduce onward community transmission.Second, surveillance testing is also done for identified groups who are more vulnerable or have higher risk of exposure to COVID-19. For example, we have been conducting rostered routine testing (RRT) on targeted groups such as workers living in the migrant worker dormitories; workers who returned to work in the construction, marine and process sectors; and workers supporting our frontline COVID-19 operations. Currently, over 200,000 such individuals are tested every two weeks. In the last two-week cycle, about 200 of such individuals tested positive for COVID-19. Majority of these cases are likely to be past infections.Third, as we reopen our economy and resume social activities, MOH will be expanding testing to more community groups. For a start, we have identified community groups such as taxi and Private Hire Car drivers, food delivery personnel, key vendors servicing foreign worker dormitories, as well as stallholders at selected hawker centres, markets and F&B establishments such as coffeeshops. While there has been no local evidence that these community groups are of higher risks of getting infected, MOH will be offering tests to them as part of our expanded testing and surveillance efforts given the nature of their working environment, such as the high frequency of interactions with members of public. These one-time testing operations will help to provide a better picture of population prevalence.Agencies and private providers supporting the testing operations endeavour to turn-around the test results as soon as possible. The current mean and median lead time between the conduct of the swab test and when the test results are made available from the laboratories are 30 hours and 22 hours respectively. Confirmed cases will be notified by the relevant parties expeditiously for the necessary public health actions to be taken."
measures at autonomous universities to reduce risk of assaults on students,Ms Tin Pei Ling asked the Minister for Education in light of the recent assault case involving an NUS student (a) what are the values and behavioural standards that students are expected to uphold; and (b) what measures are in place to ensure the safety of all students.,"24 Dr Tan Wu Meng asked the Minister for Education what measures are in place at the autonomous universities to assess the risk of assaults to their students and ensure the safety of other students, including women, in the event a student is accused or convicted of a crime involving violence. 25 Dr Tan Wu Meng asked the Minister for Education to what extent our medical and dental schools draw reference from the respective professional bodies' ethical code and guidelines for practitioners and past grounds of decisions or jurisprudence arising from the professional bodies' disciplinary tribunals, when assessing fitness to continue in the course for students who have been convicted of crimes involving violence. Mr Lawrence Wong: Several members have asked about the Autonomous Universities’ (AUs) efforts to safeguard campus safety in cases where their students have been accused or convicted of offences involving violence. Members are likely referring to the recent conviction of a student at the National University of Singapore (NUS), who assaulted his ex-girlfriend in an off-campus incident in 2019. First, all the AUs have a Code of Conduct or equivalent, which students are expected to uphold at all times. These Codes stipulate the fundamental principles and ethos expected of students as members of the University community. They span a wide range of expected behaviours, including personal, professional and academic integrity, respect for others, respect for the rule of law and campus policies, to name a few. Students are educated on these, including the need to respect others, manage boundaries and engage in appropriate behaviours. They are each responsible for contributing to a safe and secure campus environment. Second, when students commit a breach of their AUs’ Code of Conduct, they are subject to disciplinary sanctions. Such breaches include offences such as assault. AUs may impose a range of disciplinary sanctions, such as suspensions or expulsions, supervised community work and mandatory counselling. If the case involves a victim who is a student in the same university, a No-Contact Order can be put in place, where the student offender is prohibited from contacting or being in the vicinity of the victim throughout the remaining period of their studies in the university. Any student under police investigation and who is assessed to pose a danger to any member of their campus community may also be required to stay away from campus temporarily. Such a sanction can be lifted when an assessment is made that this is no longer necessary, for instance when no charges are pressed against the student.The universities also take action for student misconduct that takes place off-campus that they are made aware of, such as in this recent case of the NUS student. In such instances, they may rely on Police investigations as additional sources of information and subject the student to the disciplinary process and sanctions once sufficient details become available to them. Third, campus security measures in place include round-the-clock security personnel who carry out regular campus-wide patrols, and increased CCTV surveillance. Students are able to call campus security should they feel at risk, at any time. Finally, in response to the question from Dr Tan Wu Meng, the AUs do take reference from the professional bodies’ ethical codes and guidelines for practitioners in deciding on the disciplinary sanctions or assessing the fitness of the student to continue with his studies. The approach taken is guided by the AU’s Code of Conduct, statutes and regulations, and Board of Discipline processes. The students’ disciplinary records may also be taken into consideration when they apply to be registered practitioners."
strategy for attracting foreign direct investments in post covid-19 era,"Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Minister for Trade and Industry how will the Government continue to attract foreign direct investments during these challenging times and moving ahead given that Singapore is one of the most expensive cities and companies are reviewing their investment plans, restructuring, and offshoring their businesses after experiencing the viability of remote work/ or work-from-home arrangements.","Mr Chan Chun Sing: Attracting foreign investments will be much more difficult in this environment where supply chains will be reshuffled. Various countries are rolling out generous incentives to compete for investments, and businesses are considering relocating their supply chains closer to final demand markets. Despite these challenges, there are opportunities to be captured. In the Asia-Pacific region, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) is likely to accelerate regionalisation. Southeast Asia may also grow as a production base as countries and companies seek to diversify their footprint. To seize these new opportunities, we, i.e. the Government, our businesses and our people, must work together to adapt quickly and chart a new path. First, we seek to be a critical node in the global system, by strengthening all dimensions of connectivity with the world – physical, financial, and digital. Singapore may be an island nation, but we cannot be cast away in a globally connected world. We must continue to keep our physical links open, so that companies can trade with the rest of the world. We must strengthen our financial hub, for capital is the lifeblood of the global economy. COVID-19 has also emphasised the importance of the digital economy and we must leverage this by establishing greater digital connectivity with like-minded partners to facilitate the exchange of data. Second, we must be in a position to value-add to businesses who choose to work with us. Investors choose Singapore not because we have a large domestic market, abundant resources or that we are cheaper, but because we have an integrated eco-system of strengths that is hard to replicate elsewhere and add value to their businesses. These strengths include being trusted, open and consistent. We have also been restructuring our economy – focusing on productivity, innovation and skills upgrading – to build capabilities that are hard to replace.Third, we must remain open to ideas, technology and talent. We seek to be the place where new business ideas, new technologies can find its roots to grow. At the same time, we must remain open to talent, especially in emerging industries and to supplement our labour force. The availability of foreign talent is a major consideration for multinational companies on whether to invest in Singapore. Many are concerned about the ongoing public debate on foreign talent in Singapore, and are asking us whether we are no longer as welcoming as before. As Prime Minister shared in Parliament on Wednesday, we must strike this new balance carefully – continue to stay open, but making sure that our own workers can compete fairly with the world’s best.During this challenging time, we need to continue to be intentional and exceptional in our capabilities, connectivity and other eco-system value propositions, and remain open to compete for these investments so that we can build a future Singapore with opportunities for all. "
covid-19 vaccine plans,Mr Ang Wei Neng asked the Minister for Health what are the COVID-19 vaccine plans for Singapore.,"18 Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Health what is the Government's strategy for vaccinating Singaporeans and Singapore residents against COVID-19 once such vaccinations are available here. Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Government is closely monitoring the global progress in the development of COVID-19 vaccines, and taking active steps to ensure that Singapore has timely access to an effective and safe vaccine when this becomes available. Besides ongoing discussions with multiple pharmaceutical companies developing COVID-19 vaccines, Singapore is also actively engaged in international discussions to accelerate development and promote fair and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines. In particular, Singapore has been working closely with the World Health Organisation, Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (Gavi), the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), and like-minded countries to establish a multilateral collaboration called the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX) Facility that will enable countries to pool risk and resources to gain access to a portfolio of vaccines from different vaccine developers. Ensuring equitable access to vaccines will help to better contain and eradicate the COVID-19 pandemic, not just in Singapore but also globally. At the same time, we are supporting local efforts to develop a COVID-19 vaccine. Duke-NUS Medical School is collaborating with a United States biotechnology company, Arcturus Therapeutics, to develop an mRNA vaccine. Phase 1 human clinical trials for this vaccine candidate started in early August at the SingHealth Investigational Medicine Unit (IMU). Singapore is also building up vaccine manufacturing capacity, which can provide fill-and-finish contract manufacturing services to vaccine developers and ramp up production of vaccines when they are available.Our vaccination approach aims to protect individuals who are more vulnerable or at higher risk from the disease, as well as those who may be more likely exposed to infection, while progressively expanding the coverage of vaccination to our population. The vaccination strategy and schedule would depend on several factors including the suitability of different vaccines for different population subgroups and the quantity of vaccines available at any point in time. We will continue to adapt our vaccination strategy as more information from the various vaccine candidates becomes available."
addressing mental health challenges faced by foreign workers affected by isolation at dormitories,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what measures have been put in place to address mental health challenges faced by migrant workers during this period including those who are barred from leaving their living and work spaces; (b) when have these measures been put in place; (c) what is being done to help workers who develop mental health conditions when under confinement; and (d) what steps are taken to ascertain the effectiveness of such measures and to improve on them.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: Since the dormitories were isolated in early April, the Inter-Agency Task Force has recognised that both the physical and mental health of the residents need to be well looked after. These efforts continue even after the dormitories were cleared under the new Assurance, Care & Engagement Group (ACE).There are a few channels for workers to seek and get help if they are facing mental distress. The Migrant Workers’ Centre (MWC) runs a 24 hour Helpline with staff experienced in supporting migrant workers. When necessary, they will escalate cases to professional counsellors. For serious cases, workers could be referred to mental health specialists in the hospitals for in-person consultations. During circuit breaker, the MWC Helpline received about 700 calls per week.In April, HealthServe also launched a dedicated hotline for migrant workers to access medical information and submit requests for tele-counselling sessions. Since then, the service has received more than 15,000 enquiries. Their volunteer counsellors and psychiatrists have helped more than 1,100 workers.To help prevent isolation-induced stress in the first place, being able to return to work is important. It will also address anxiety over job stability. On this, we have systematically tested every worker in the dormitories and segregated them so that those who are infected can be treated promptly, while those who are not infected or have recovered can be moved into COVID-cleared rooms or blocks. This is necessary to stop further transmission and to help workers return to their work faster. This process started in June and was completed in mid-August. As of 31 Aug, close to 90% of workers in the dormitories are able to resume work.We have started trials to allow residents of selected cleared dorms to go to Recreation Centres on their rest days at staggered timings. We have also worked with NGOs to conduct activities that help improve the mental well-being of our migrant workers. For instance, the Alliance of Guest Workers’ Outreach (AGWO) recently piloted an organised activity to the parks; and the COVID-19 Migrant Support Coalition (CMSC) has been providing free hair cuts and mental wellness engagement activities at temporary Government-provided accommodation.Supporting these measures are the Forward Assurance & Support Teams (FAST). We have started to train and equip our FAST teams to identify and manage mental health issues. MWC’s network of 5,000 Foreign Worker Ambassadors will also proactively look out for distressed migrant workers and try to understand their key concerns so that the right help can be given quickly.To address residents’ common concerns, we have assured the workers through our daily bulletins sent through the dormitory operators, MWC Ambassadors and the foreign worker mobile applications. As one prevalent worry is becoming infected, we have circulated videos of doctors advising workers on how to protect themselves, and of recovered workers sharing their experience, to ease the workers’ anxiety. We also facilitated the departure of workers who wanted to return home.There are signs that these measures have helped. After calls to the MWC Helpline spiked to 700 calls per week during circuit breaker, call volume has reduced to around 500 a week now. This is not too far from the pre-Covid call volume of around 400 a week. We will continue to monitor and support the workers closely."
reports of mental health cases arising from work-from-home arrangements during covid-19 pandemic,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Health in light of reports that Singaporeans are more stressed working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic (a) whether there is an increase in mental health cases over the last few months; (b) what current measures are in place to help affected Singaporeans; and (c) whether further measures are needed as work-from-home arrangements continue amidst the pandemic.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about shifts in the way we work and interact with others, with more Singaporeans working from home during the pandemic. In the period of April to July 2020, there was a decrease of 36 percent in the number of attendances at the Specialist Outpatient Clinic and a decrease of eight percent in Emergency Department visits at the Institute of Mental Health, as compared to the same period last year, in part due to the Circuit Breaker (CB) measures. However, for the same period, there was an increase of 60 percent in the number of calls to the IMH Mental Health Helpline as compared to last year. Similarly, the number of community referrals for mental health issues to the Agency for Integrated Care’s (AIC) Care-in-Mind online platform more than doubled during this period with demand returning to normal levels in July 2020 post CB. In summary, with the exception of IMH Mental Health Helpline, the utilization of mental healthcare services has returned to the level seen prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. To further support the mental health needs of Singaporeans during the pandemic, the National CARE Hotline was launched in April 2020 to provide support to those facing mental health concerns such as anxiety and adjustment issues related to COVID-19. As of 20 August 2020, the hotline has handled approximately 27,900 calls. About 11,800 of these calls were directed to trained volunteers to provide psychological first aid, while the remaining calls which are specific to other needs such as finance and employment issues were directed to the appropriate hotlines. Individuals who needed more targeted and continued support were referred to help services such as counselling centres or specialised helplines. The number of calls has since decreased by about 42 percent post CB. To provide information and self-help tools to improve mental well-being, Temasek Foundation, AIC, and the Ministry of Health Office for Healthcare Transformation have developed online mental health platforms such as the ""My Mental Health"" Microsite (www.stayprepared.sg/mymentalhealth/), and Mindline.sg. Users will also be able to find out more on the support services that are available to them through these platforms.To address the challenges of working from home, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has issued an inter-agency Advisory in April this year to advise employers and workers on practical steps to take and to tap on counselling resources to support one’s mental well-being during the COVID-19 period. Recommendations for employers include regular checking in with staff, provide flexible work schedules for parents of young children; and provide employees with access to external counselling service. Employees are also encouraged to maintain a circle of social support; and stay active and healthy during this period. The Ministry of Health will continue to work with its partner agencies to monitor the trends of utilisation of support services and provide timely intervention if necessary. "
declaring foreign worker dormitories to be clear of covid-19,Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for Manpower whether there has been an error in declaring a dormitory to be cleared of the COVID-19 virus when a subsequent new cluster is found to have originated from that dormitory.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: The Inter-Agency Taskforce (ITF) systematically tested all dormitory residents to clear the dormitories of COVID-19. This means that all dormitory residents have either recovered, have been tested to be free from the virus, or have moved to other government facilities to complete their isolation or quarantine depending on their health status.  As many of the dormitory residents have never been infected, they remain susceptible to COVID-19.This is why clearing a dormitory does not mean that there will never be any new infections in future. What is key is for the workers, employers, and dormitory operators to remain vigilant and continue to comply with safe distancing measures to minimise the risk of another outbreak.  To detect new COVID-19 cases and contain the infections quickly and decisively, we have also put in place a multi-layered strategy. First, to prevent potential infections, we have put in place Safe Living, Safe Working and Safe Rest Day measures. Before residents are allowed to return to work, dormitory operators have to implement a slew of physical distancing measures in the dormitory, such as: (i) limiting the inter-mixing of workers across rooms, levels and blocks; (ii) scheduling access to common facilities; (iii) putting in place staggered pick-up and drop-off times for workers; and (iv) ensuring safe distancing between workers. They must also monitor their workers’ health and take necessary precautions, so that workers who are unwell are quickly isolated and provided with medical treatment.Second, to swiftly detect new cases of infection, a number of strategies are deployed. This include (i) self-monitoring by migrant workers and updating on their health status through the FWMOMCare App; (ii) close monitoring of workers who report sick at medical posts with acute respiratory illnesses; (iii) checking the wastewater from certain dormitories for traces of the COVID-19 virus; and (iv) rostered routine testing for dormitory residents every 14 days.Finally, if a new case is detected, we have put in place measures to contain its spread. Close contacts will be quarantined and aggressive testing operations will be conducted to arrest a further spread of the virus. Workers must be tested negative at the end of their quarantine period before they are able to return to work. These measures continue to be adjusted in consultation with health experts, as new insights are gained about how the virus spreads.COVID-19 remains a threat, as shown by the new infection cases in cleared dormitories. We look forward to the continued understanding, support and cooperation of all parties as we move together on the road to recovery."
patients accessing subsidised care at public hospitals and specialist centres,"Dr Tan Wu Meng asked the Minister for Health (a) over the past three years, how many Singaporeans at public hospitals and specialist centres have requested to change from a paying class to subsidised care; (b) how many of such patients have accessed paying class care through (i) employment-linked insurance or (ii) personal integrated shield plans; and (c) of these, what proportion subsequently received subsidised care at the same rates as de novo subsidised patients.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Upon admission, Singaporeans can choose to be admitted into private or subsidised ward classes regardless of their means and hospitals provide financial counselling to patients to help them select a ward class appropriate to their needs.  To receive subsidised specialist outpatient (SOC) treatment, a patient needs a referral from a subsidised inpatient ward class, emergency department or a polyclinic. Hence, patients who opt for private ward will be considered as private patients and charged unsubsidised rates should they require follow-ups at the SOCs after discharge. Nonetheless, should they need to switch to subsidised care due to financial concerns, for both the inpatient and SOC settings, they can approach the staff at our public healthcare providers for assistance. The providers assess such requests on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration patient’s financial circumstances and ability to continue to pay unsubsidised rates. For patients facing genuine financial difficulties, the providers will exercise some flexibility and allow them to switch to subsidised service and pay subsidised rates.  In the past three years, on average, we have received about 2,400 requests a year to switch from private to subsidised inpatient or SOC care, out of a total of 80,000 admissions from private wards and 1,000,000 private SOC attendances a year. About 70% of these requests are approved.  Patients with Integrated Shield Plans make up about 35% of all requests in the inpatient setting. Our public healthcare providers’ administrative records do not capture whether a patient’s insurance scheme is employment-linked. I would like to assure the Member that our public healthcare providers will consider, among other things, changes to a patient’s circumstances, such as loss of income or private insurance coverage, in assessing whether to accede to requests to switch to subsidised care. Patients facing financial difficulties should approach the medical social workers to discuss their options. "
usage and effectiveness of tracetogether app,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song asked the Prime Minister (a) how many active users does the TraceTogether app currently have; (b) how many contacts of COVID-19 patients have been identified and contacted with the help of data retrieved from the TraceTogether app since its launch; and (c) how many of these contacts tested positive for COVID-19.,"Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): The TraceTogether (TT) Programme, comprising the TT App on smartphones and TT Tokens, utilise Bluetooth functionality to enhance and accelerate contact tracing of close contacts of COVID-19 positive patients.The TT programme, SafeEntry and associated digital systems provide the initial list of close contacts of COVID-19 positive cases for our contact tracing teams to work on. This has enabled us to reduce the time to identify and quarantine a close contact from four days to less than two days currently.Since we switched over to this concept of operations, 118,000 close contacts were identified, of which 4,500 subsequently tested positive during quarantine.The effectiveness of TT and SafeEntry relies on broad based community participation. This is how we contribute collectively to keeping ourselves, our loved ones, and colleagues safe. The more people on the system, the more effective the protection. We are glad that the App has been downloaded by 2.4 million individuals since its launch. We estimate that about 1.4 million users had actively used the App in the month of August.We will do more to encourage and facilitate active adoption, by improving the App’s features over time. We urge all who have downloaded the TT App to keep it active in the foreground. One practical way to do so is to use the App to perform more convenient SafeEntry check-ins. We have started distributing tokens to seniors and those without smart phones in order to provide protection for these vulnerable groups. In due course, we will also make tokens available for those who prefer not to use the App on their smart phones."
recruitment for cyber nsf and cyber military expert schemes,Mr Chong Kee Hiong asked the Minister for Defence (a) whether he can provide an update on the recruitment rate for the Cyber NSF Scheme and the Cyber Military Experts Scheme; and (b) what are the measures to attract more cyber talents to the Ministry to support digital defence.,"Dr Ng Eng Hen: The Cyber NSF scheme was introduced in 2018, to attract and train Full-time National Service (NSF) personnel with the requisite interest, aptitude and skills to be Cyber Specialists. Successful applicants receive undergraduate work-learn programmes and on-the-job training which is sponsored, after which they are deployed in various roles to defend networks and systems within Mindef and the SAF. From inception, about 170 NSFs have been enrolled through the scheme over a period of two years. The proportion of successful applicants is about 23%.As with other vocations, these cyber NSFs complement regulars who serve as SAF Command, Control, Communications and Computers Experts (C4X) or the non-uniformed Defence Cyber Expert (DCX). Over the past year, more than 150 personnel have been recruited to these two vocations.  Again, as with all science and technology based vocations, there are programs for upstream cultivation to promote awareness and interest in the realm of cyber defence. To this end, the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) has organized Cyberthon competitions and Cyber Defenders Discovery Camp. This year’s virtually-held Cyber Defenders Discovery Camp attracted a record participation of 3,200 youth, ranging from secondary school students to university undergraduates. It is our hope that some amongst them will be inspired to join MINDEF and the SAF as cyber vocationlists.We will continue to enhance these initiatives and develop new ones so as to build up a cyber workforce to defend our digital borders."
essential services disrupted by isolation measures at foreign worker dormitories,"Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim asked the Minister for National Development (a) which estates currently remain more disproportionately affected, in terms of essential service provision by foreign workers, by COVID-19-related dormitory shutdowns; and (b) whether there is a plan to assist in the temporary redeployment of workers across different estates to facilitate the clearing of backlogs in the more affected estates.","Mr Desmond Lee: All foreign worker dormitories have been declared clear of COVID-19 as of 19 August 2020. The majority of foreign workers living in dormitories are now able to resume work.The Ministry of Development (MND) understands from the Town Councils (TCs) that most of their contractors have resumed the provision of essential services to the TCs at full capacity. While a small number of contractors have yet to fully resume their essential services to the TCs for reasons such as workers being placed on quarantine, or having tested positive for COVID-19, there is currently no TC whose essential services have been significantly compromised by the non-availability of foreign workers.Generally, if there is a need, TCs should be able to tap on their other contractors to cover the work of the affected contractors, which constitute a minority. Hence, there are currently no plans for the Government to step in to temporarily redeploy essential workers across TCs."
adoption of blockchain-based multi-currency payments network,"Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked the Prime Minister (a) with the conclusion of Project Ubin, what are the steps towards live adoption of a blockchain-based multi-currency payments network prototype; and (b) how soon can a pilot launch in Singapore be expected.","Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): Project Ubin is a collaborative industry effort led by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, to explore the use of blockchain technology to clear and settle payments and securities more efficiently. The project will help us better understand the technology and its potential benefits. To date, more than 40 financial institutions, FinTechs and technology firms have participated in the project.The findings, technical documentation, and source codes have been published openly, to to encourage commercial applications. One example is JPM-Coin by J.P. Morgan, which was largely developed out of Singapore, by the same team that worked on Project Ubin. Some industry players have also expressed interest in leveraging the project learnings to develop a live commercial offering for multi-currency payments.In due course when the commercial endeavor materialises, the parties will make their announcements and share more about their roll-out plans. "
progress of development on thomson-east coast line given delays due to covid-19,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the progress of the Thomson-East Coast line given the delays related to COVID-19; and (b) whether this spillover will lead to delays for other major planned MRT projects.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: The Circuit Breaker and phased re-opening since April this year have caused delays to the completion of the Thomson-East Coast Line Stage 2 (TEL2). Notwithstanding, we will be able to make up for some lost time, so TEL2 will open by 1Q 2021, a three-month delay from the original schedule of opening by this year. However, unlike the TEL2 which is near completion and prioritised for resumption of work, we will only be able to better assess the length of delays on subsequent phases of TEL and other MRT projects when construction activities have more fully resumed. The Government remains committed to significantly expand the MRT network, from around 230km today to 360km by the early 2030s. This includes opening the remaining stages of the Thomson-East Coast Line, completing the circle with Circle Line Stage 6, as well as building the North East Line Extension, Jurong Region Line and Cross Island Line. "
measures to address over-subscription during primary 1 registration exercise in bukit batok and sengkang,"Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Education in light of the fact that 226 children were vying for 38 Primary one places in Princess Elizabeth Primary School during Phase 2C of the admission exercise, whether an additional primary school can be built within Bukit Batok HDB Town to cope with the increased demand for Primary one places.","45 Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim asked the Minister for Education (a) for each of the past five years, what are the statistics on the over-subscription of Primary one spaces in Sengkang primary schools and for the nation as a whole; (b) whether there is spare capacity in terms of classrooms for Primary one level in Sengkang primary schools compared to the nation as a whole; (c) what is the student-teacher ratio of primary schools for Primary one in Sengkang relative to the average for the nation as a whole; and (d) what are the factors considered in setting the number of Primary one spaces for schools in Sengkang, and Singapore as a whole. Mr Lawrence Wong: MOE’s school planning objective is to ensure there are sufficient school places and school resourcing to support all Singaporean school-going children, at both the national and regional levels. We annually review to ensure that the number of Primary one places across the country and in each residential area are sufficient for the current and projected population. We also take into account planned future housing developments in each residential area, with the objective of ensuring that every eligible Singaporean and Singapore Permanent Resident (PR) child has access to a place in a primary school reasonably near to their home. Generally, around 98% of Singaporean and Singapore PR children are able to obtain a place in a primary school of their choice, or a primary school within two km of their residence. The proportion remains similar in this year's exercise. Even after Phase 2C (Supplementary), we will still have vacancies to facilitate all remaining children into a school generally not far from their home.In Bukit Batok and Sengkang, for example, there have been new housing developments, some recently completed while others are in different stages of construction, to be completed over the next few years. MOE carefully reviews the demand and supply situation in these areas not just for the coming year but also projects this for the next several years. This is to enable us to make timely plans to build new schools should there be a sustained increase in demand over the medium to long-term, or consider making year-by-year intake adjustments for some of the schools in these areas to meet the projected demand.  In Bukit Batok, there are six primary schools, and as a whole, there are sufficient primary school places in the area. There are two schools with about 150 remaining vacancies at the end of Phase 2C (Supplementary) in this year’s P1 Registration Exercise. This represents around 12% of total planned Primary one places in Bukit Batok. For parents who could not register their children in the popular Princess Elizabeth Primary School, they can consider other nearby schools which still have vacancies. To Mr Murali Pillai’s question on whether an additional primary school would be built to cope with the increase in demand for Primary one places in Bukit Batok HDB town, MOE is indeed carefully studying this as part of the development plans of the nearby Tengah New Town. I would like to assure the Member that we will make timely plans for any new school based on medium to long-term demand projections. For Sengkang, there are 12 primary schools, with three schools having around a total of 120 remaining vacancies at the end of Phase 2C (Supplementary) in this year’s exercise. This represents about 4% of total planned Primary one places in Sengkang.  For growing areas like Sengkang and Bukit Batok, the primary schools may be fuller to provide as many places as possible to children living nearby. This is unlike more mature areas where there are fewer children to fill the schools. Nonetheless, even in Sengkang, each school has about two spare classrooms in this year’s P1 Registration Exercise. These classrooms could be used by schools to conduct small group lessons to support students’ learning.  Currently, the national pupil-teacher ratio (PTR) at the Primary level is about 15. The average PTR for primary schools in Sengkang is 16. We resource our schools based on their student profile and the programmes they run. Special attention is paid to deploy additional teachers to schools with more students with learning needs so these students can be supported through targeted interventions. Hence, PTRs will differ across schools given our needs-based resourcing approach."
cost savings at tertiary institutions arising from online learning,"Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Education whether there have been cost savings at tertiary institutions arising from the replacement of face-to-face lessons with online learning and, if so, whether these cost savings may be passed to the students in the form of tuition fee rebates.","Mr Lawrence Wong: The institutes of higher learning (IHLs) have been leveraging on technology to support students’ learning. During the Circuit Breaker period, they had to shift all learning online for all students. Post Circuit-Breaker, online learning has continued at varying levels, alongside the resumption of some in-person classes. While the change in delivery mode over the past six months has brought about cost savings on some fronts, there are also many areas of increased costs. For example, institutions incurred costs to enhance existing IT systems and facilities, purchase new tools to support online learning, and develop new learning resources to cater to the significantly higher demands for online teaching. Additional costs were also incurred due to safe management measures and enhanced cleaning and disinfection, which will continue to be incurred in the new normal.  A significant portion of the IHLs’ running costs are due to manpower costs. The academic and non-academic staff in each institution are working even harder than usual, to review and adjust their curriculum and teaching, and mitigate the disruptions to practicals, overseas exchanges and internships in order to ensure that students continue to learn uninterrupted, in a different but meaningful way. IHL staff have also stepped up efforts to help graduates with career guidance and support for their job searches.   Notwithstanding all of these cost considerations, MOE and the IHLs have decided to freeze the tuition fees this year in light of the difficult economic situation. We will continue to review tuition fees annually with the IHLs, to ensure that fees reflect changes in the cost of delivering education, while keeping them affordable for Singaporeans.  "
enhancing and securing internet connectivity given prevalence of work-from-home arrangements,Mr Chong Kee Hiong asked the Minister for Communications and Information how will the Ministry enhance Internet connectivity islandwide and ensure that our connections remain secure and robust especially when work-from-home becomes more prevalent.,"Mr S Iswaran: Singapore’s digital infrastructure has been able to accommodate the rise in Internet traffic arising from COVID-19. Traffic volume remains well within each telecom operator’s network capacity, with a healthy buffer of at least 30%.IMDA has also put in place measures to minimise the risk of network disruptions, and ensure a speedy recovery if such disruptions were to occur. For example, IMDA requires key telecom operators to conduct regular audits to ensure that the resilience of their networks is on par with international best practices. IMDA also requires telecom operators to comply with requirements in areas such as redundancy and diversity. The Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) also requires telecom operators that own Critical Information Infrastructure to adhere to mandatory cybersecurity requirements prescribed under the Cybersecurity Act.  My Ministry and IMDA continue to enhance our digital infrastructure for the next bound of growth in our digital economy. For example, we are working with our telecom operators to deploy world-class nationwide 5G networks that are secure and resilient.  In parallel, the Government is also taking steps to better protect Singaporeans and our enterprises against cyber threats. CSA will launch the Safer Cyberspace Masterplan later this year, to secure our core digital infrastructure and safeguard our cyberspace. Earlier in March, CSA also released an advisory that provides tips for individuals to stay cyber-safe while telecommuting; for example, by using a secure Wi-Fi network, and sending important and sensitive information over a Virtual Private Network."
broadband service subsidies for seniors in low-income households,Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) whether senior citizens from low-income households qualify for subsidies to access broadband services in their homes under the Digital Access Programme; and (b) whether the cost of installing a broadband point in their homes can be subsidised under the programme.,"Mr S Iswaran: The Government is committed to building an inclusive digital society, where all Singaporeans, including our seniors, are empowered with digital skills and have the means to access digital platforms.Under IMDA’s Home Access (HA) programme, eligible low-income households, including those with senior citizens, can enjoy two years of subsidised home broadband services, and the option to own one subsidised device per household. The fees for broadband installation, as well as fees for installing the first termination point, are waived for beneficiaries. The Home Access programme has benefitted many seniors, with 75% of current beneficiaries comprising households with seniors aged 60 and above. In this year alone, nearly 4,000 seniors have benefitted from the Home Access scheme.IMDA also recently introduced subsidies for low-income seniors to obtain personal smartphones and mobile plans under the Mobile Access for Seniors (MAS) scheme. The scheme supports low-income seniors with on-the-go connectivity, and complements the SG Digital Office’s efforts to raise the digital skills of seniors. 800 seniors have benefited from this scheme since its launch in July.Our efforts at ensuring digital inclusion of seniors have been well-received. To-date, 16,000 seniors have taken part in the SG Digital Office’s digital skilling initiatives. Many of the seniors, some of whom I recently met at Teck Ghee Community Centre, are eager to learn and possess a can-do spirit. With the support of our corporate and community partners, Digital Ambassadors and volunteers, we will continue our efforts to ensure that seniors are not left behind in Singapore’s digitalisation journey."
criteria and appeals for early graduation from home ownerhsip plus education scheme,Ms Raeesah Khan asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what is the number of families and widowed or divorced mothers who have appealed for early graduation from the Home Ownership Plus Education (HOPE) Scheme since its implementation in 2004; and (b) what is the approval rate of these appeals.,"47 Ms Raeesah Khan asked the Minister for Social and Family Development what are the criteria that families and widowed or divorced mothers under the Home Ownership Plus Education (HOPE) Scheme need to meet in order to graduate from the scheme. Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The Home Ownership Plus Education (HOPE) scheme supports young, low-income families who choose to keep their families small, so that they can focus their resources on giving their children a head start, and improve their financial and social situation. Families who join the scheme receive assistance in the form of housing subsidies, utilities grants, employment and training incentives, education bursaries, family planning and mentoring support.Families can stay on the scheme until graduation, when the mother turns 45 years of age. They can also choose to withdraw from the scheme earlier at any time. The Ministry will help families to transit to other forms of assistance, if needed. Families who have improved their circumstances over time and wish to have more than two children within the context of marriage may apply to graduate early from the scheme, if their monthly household income exceeds $4,000, and both husband and wife have been in sustained employment for at least five years. If a family’s appeal for early graduation is supported, it can keep all benefits disbursed to them under the scheme. Since the scheme’s inception in 2004, we have supported four out of the five clients who appealed for early graduation. One divorced client’s appeal was turned down as she did not meet the criteria for early graduation."
application for government paid childcare leave scheme broken down by gender of employees,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Social and Family Development for each year in the past five years under the Government-Paid Childcare Leave (GPCL) Scheme, what is the median number of days of childcare leave taken per year by (i) female employees and (ii) male employees respectively.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Employees with Singapore Citizen children below seven years of age are entitled to six days of paid childcare leave per year under the Government-Paid Childcare Leave Scheme. Employers are responsible for the first three days of leave, while the Government reimburses employers for the fourth to sixth day of leave taken.Employers are not required to submit information on employees who take only one to three days of leave, to avoid burdening employers and employees with excessive data submission. Hence, we only have information when leave is consumed beyond the third day.  From 2016 to 2019, the median number of days of leave taken by male and female employees has been the same, and it is six days. This is based on employees who consumed more than three days of childcare leave and where employers submitted claims. "
proposal for coding in mainstream curriculum at schools,Ms Tin Pei Ling asked the Minister for Education whether coding can be mandated as part of the mainstream curriculum instead of enrichment programmes for students.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: We recognise the importance of coding in our young people, especially in this digital age. But programming languages can change and become outdated over time. So it is important to focus on the underlying skills such as computational thinking, problem solving, logical reasoning and data handling. These underlying skills are developed through the learning of subjects, particularly mathematics and science. At the same time, we have worked with IMDA to expose all students to basic coding and technology through the 'Code For Fun' programme.     With a broad base of exposure to basic coding, and with a strong foundation in the underlying skills, students will be able to easily pick up and learn new programming languages as they progress through different stages of their education."
criteria for setting up hawker centres and wet markets,"Mr Don Wee asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment what are the criteria, such as the number of dwelling units, to set up a hawker centre and wet market within a constituency.","Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: In 2011, the Government announced its intention to restart building hawker centres after a 26-year hiatus, focusing on new estates or existing ones that are relatively under-served in terms of a diversity of affordable dining options. This ensures Singaporeans will continue to have access to affordable food across Singapore. We announced in 2011 and 2015 that we would build twenty new hawker centres in total. Seven are already in operation while another ten are currently in the design development or construction stages and are expected to be completed by 2027. For the remaining three hawker centres, one has earlier been announced to be in Choa Chu Kang Town Centre while the locations of the remaining two will be announced in due course. As we plan for the long term, the National Environment Agency (NEA) assesses the need for new hawker centres to serve towns with larger geographical areas and populations instead of individual constituencies. NEA works closely with planning agencies such as URA and HDB to identify appropriate locations for new hawker centres based on criteria such as residential catchment and availability of affordable and comparable F&B options in the vicinity. For residents’ convenience and to ensure a viable level of business for hawkers, sites with good accessibility and connectivity are also preferred, such as those co-located with other amenities or transport nodes. New hawker centres will generally not come with a market section selling fresh produce given the availability of alternative options such as HDB market produce shops and supermarkets. From our experience, market sections in hawker centres require sufficient scale to succeed, and must attract customers from a broader regional level. Those which are unable to get this catchment generally do not fare well."
local-foreign employment in local food production sector,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) what is the ratio of Singaporeans to foreigners working in the local food production sector; and (b) how will the Ministry attract more Singaporeans to the farming sector to work as employees or as owners and entrepreneurs.,"Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: The local agri-food sector comprises over two hundred farms producing mainly eggs, fish and vegetables. As of June 2020, slightly more than half of the workers hired in the sector were locals, and most of the foreign workers were semi-skilled workers holding Work Permits. This is because the majority of these farms adopt conventional methods of food production, which are often low in productivity and labour-intensive, involving manual feeding or planting, harvesting and packing.With new farming technologies, the agri-food sector presents fresh job opportunities. My Ministry has set the ""30 by 30"" goal to produce 30 percent of our nutritional needs locally by 2030, up from less than 10% today. To achieve it, we will need to uplift and transform our farms to embrace such new technologies to be highly productive, innovative and sustainable. The agri-food sector will generate more higher value-add jobs and demand for skilled workers. For instance, vegetable farming can shift from single-layer outdoor cultivation which is manpower-intensive, to multi-tiered, automated indoor farming where a few workers can manage the growing environment through sensors and a computer-controlled system. We have introduced policies to support the industry in its transformation journey. Since 2014, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) has been co-funding farmers’ investments in productivity-enhancing farming equipment through the $63 million Agriculture Productivity Fund. In April this year, SFA launched the ""30 by 30 Express"" Grant Call to crowdsource innovative proposals to accelerate local production in the near term amidst disruptions in global food supply chains due to COVID-19. As the agri-food sector modernises, we can expect to see a shift in agri-food sector workforce towards one that is highly-skilled and manpower-efficient. There will be a growing demand for agriculture/aquaculture specialists, and we will build up a pipeline of local talents with multi-disciplinary skillsets.To attract and emplace skilled workers in the agri-food sector, SFA has worked with various Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) and local farms to develop relevant Pre-Employment Training (PET) and Continuing Education and Training (CET) courses. These programmes equip students and adult job seekers with skillsets that will lead to careers in the agri-food sector. For example, over the years, SFA has partnered polytechnics to curate diploma programmes in aquaculture and agriculture technology, including part-time diplomas targeted at career-switchers keen to join the high-tech farming sector and individuals in the sector looking to upgrade their skills. SFA also helps to match students in these programmes to local farms for structured internship opportunities, giving them a first-hand experience of working in farms while putting their knowledge and practical skills to use. More than 60 students have benefited from such structured internships over the past three years. Just a few months ago, SFA partnered Temasek Polytechnic to launch a SGUnited Skills programme, ""Up-Skill in Aquaculture Technology"", to provide essential knowledge for Singaporeans who are keen on a career in the aquaculture industry.SFA will continue to introduce and expand initiatives that will transform the agri-food sector and upskill the agri-food workforce. These will be rolled out at the right time to meet industry needs without creating oversupply. We want to see more Singaporeans in the local agri-food sector, contributing towards a more food-secure Singapore."
cleaning of debris washed ashore due to monsoon season,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment with regard to the marine trash washing ashore Singapore during the monsoon season (a) which beaches are usually impacted by the monsoon season; (b) how has the schedule of the cleaning of recreational beaches been impacted during the COVID-19 period; (c) what is the schedule of cleaning of non-recreational beaches; and (d) how is the Ministry working with other countries to mitigate the issues of marine trash.,"Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: Singapore faces the Northeast monsoon from November to March and the Southwest monsoon from June to September. The monsoon brings along flotsam to our shores. During the Northeast monsoon, the recreational beaches of Changi Beach, Pasir Ris, Punggol, Coney Island and Sembawang are affected by flotsam, while East Coast Park is affected during the Southwest monsoon. In 2019, NEA collected over 1,000 tonnes of flotsam from East Coast Beach, of which about half were collected during the Southwest monsoon months. During those months, there was an increase of almost 90% in the amount of flotsam collected from the beach.To keep our recreational beaches clean, NEA increases the frequency of cleaning at these beaches from four times a week to twice a day during the monsoon periods. Non-recreational beaches not accessible to the public are cleaned once a week or fortnightly, depending on the amount of flotsam washed to our shores. This frequency of cleaning has been maintained even during the COVID-19 period. Nevertheless, despite this high frequency cleaning regime, after each cleaning session, new waves of flotsam from the open sea are washed onto our shores during each high tide. We are gratified to see that Singaporeans have taken the initiative to help clean our beaches. Many ground-up groups are actively involved in cleaning regularly. One of them, ""East Coast Beach Plan"" with more than 2,500 members, has been facilitating clean-up since July and has collected about 9,600kg of litter in August alone. Singapore is an active contributor to international and regional platforms that address the issue of marine litter, which is transboundary in nature. We have worked with the international community to craft and adopt resolutions on Marine Plastic Litter and Addressing Single-Use Plastic Products Pollution at the 4th UN Environment Assembly, and worked with G20 countries to establish the 2019 G20 Implementation Framework for Actions on Marine Plastic Litter. We are also a member of the Ad-Hoc Open-Ended Expert Group (AHEG) on Marine Litter and Microplastics under the United Nations Environment Programme.At the regional level, Singapore, along with other ASEAN member states, adopted the Bangkok Declaration on Combating Marine Debris and the ASEAN Framework of Action on Marine Debris in June 2019. We are also active in marine litter initiatives organised by the Coordinating Body on the Seas of East Asia (COBSEA) and Partnerships in Environmental Management of the Seas of East Asia (PEMSEA). Last but not least, Singapore conducts capacity building programmes under the Singapore Cooperation Programme to support other developing countries in combating marine litter, and undertakes bilateral cooperation with countries to address the problem. Even as we continue to tackle marine litter, all of us should do our part to keep our beaches clean. Littering not only spoils the beauty of our beaches, but also harms wildlife. I urge visitors to do their part and bin their rubbish when at the beaches, and advise others to practise similar good habits."
recent trends in high-rise littering,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) how many culprits of high-rise littering cases have been charged in the past five years; (b) whether there has been a rising trend over the past five years; and (c) whether new measures will be implemented to curb the problem.,"Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: The National Environment Agency (NEA) took 6,000 enforcement actions in total against 2,200 offenders for high-rise littering in the past five years. The number of enforcements per year hovered between 1,100 to 1,500 from 2016 to 2019.The use of surveillance cameras with video analytics has contributed significantly to improving NEA’s enforcement efforts. It has enabled NEA to increase the yearly enforcement actions from 11 in 2012, prior to the use of surveillance cameras, to over 1,000 in recent years. To further improve effectiveness, NEA has implemented additional measures. Besides significantly increasing the number of surveillance camera deployments, NEA has also streamlined processes to reduce the time taken for investigation and partnered closely with Town Councils to enable more timely information-sharing and prompt reporting of the interventions conducted.Going forward, NEA will explore better camera technology and strengthen partnerships with communities to develop localised solutions for the high-rise littering problem. For example, we worked with Grassroots Leaders, the Town Council and agencies such as the Municipal Services Office (MSO) last year to pilot a project for two blocks of flats in Yio Chu Kang that had persistent issues with high-rise littering and pigeon-feeding. The grassroots had formed a community watch group to conduct house visits and raise awareness about the issue among residents, while NEA deployed surveillance cameras and MSO developed new publicity materials and informed residents about the number of persons caught. The joint efforts saw a dip in the number of feedback on high-rise littering and pigeon feeding in the area. NEA will be looking into more of such community co-solutioning with active surveillance and enforcement in future.    High-rise littering is an anti-social and irresponsible act which affects public safety and environmental hygiene. Even as we step up our efforts to address the situation, we must also step up our efforts as a community to cultivate social graciousness, consideration for others and a sense of collective responsibility for the cleanliness of our common spaces."
measures to mitigate disamenities from second-hand cigarette smoke in residential areas,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) what measures is the Ministry studying to assist individuals who are negatively affected by second-hand cigarette smoke from their neighbours smoking within their HDB flats; and (b) whether the Ministry has studied the effectiveness and receptiveness of bans on residents smoking at their balconies and windows implemented at some condominiums.,"Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: The issue of smoking is one that requires everyone to play their part. Smokers are encouraged to exercise social responsibility and be mindful of the health of others, and not light up where the smoke will affect others. Families and friends of smokers, as well as the general public, can help reinforce the right social norms. To assist individuals who are affected by second-hand cigarette smoke arising from neighbours smoking in their HDB flats, the National Environment Agency (NEA) works with Town Councils and HDB to advise smokers to be considerate when smoking. Oftentimes, the smoker is unaware that his actions have affected his neighbour and such advisories are sufficient in encouraging the smoker to adjust his behaviour. Community leaders also help to mediate between neighbours, help them empathise with one another’s situation and discuss what adjustments can be made. Affected residents can also seek help from the Community Mediation Centre (CMC), which provides mediation service for disputes between neighbours. Trained mediators will facilitate discussions between parties in an effort to reach a mutually acceptable solution. For intractable cases where parties are unable to resolve their disputes, residents can raise the matter to the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunal as a last resort. We do not have information on any condominiums that have implemented a ban on residents smoking at their balconies or windows. We are only aware of the case of a condominium that had issued a circular telling residents to refrain from smoking on their balconies and in window areas, which was reported in the press in August 2017. While some residents were supportive, there were also those who argued that the management should not dictate what one can or cannot do in their private spaces. We understand that subsequently, the management did not proceed to ban residents from smoking on their balconies and in window areas."
impact of covid-19 pandemic on designs for future hdb flats,"Mr Chong Kee Hiong asked the Minister for National Development whether the COVID-19 pandemic has an impact on the future designs of HDB flats such as provision for spaces to work from home and, if not, whether HDB will consider factoring such considerations into future flats.","Mr Desmond Lee: HDB flats are designed to provide a living environment that is functional and comfortable. For instance, bedrooms are built with large windows to optimise natural lighting and ventilation, while kitchens are designed to be open to increase the sense of spaciousness within the flat.HDB flats are also designed to provide flexibility for residents to reconfigure spaces in their homes to meet their needs. For example, columns in new flats are pushed to the edges wherever possible, so that home owners can have more flexibility in reconfiguring their home layout.These design principles came in useful during the circuit breaker when residents had to work from home and students had to undergo home-based learning.Beyond flats, HDB has also over the years introduced more greenery, and play and fitness equipment to enhance the living environment in our precincts and neighbourhoods. These extended living spaces give our flat dwellers a respite from the confines of their homes while seeking to encourage a healthy lifestyle. Commercial amenities such as supermarkets and eating houses have also been planned to be within easy walking distance from homes.We are studying how HDB flat designs can support developments in the future of work, including trends that may have been accelerated by the current pandemic, such as telecommuting. Today, broadband for Wi-Fi ready connections is already available in all public housing flats, facilitating working and studying from home. HDB is also trialing 'smart-enabled' homes in Punggol Northshore and Tengah so that residents can adopt more smart applications. If feasible, we will incorporate these features into future designs. We will also continue to gather views and ideas to improve the design of public housing to better meet residents’ needs, as part of the Emerging Stronger Conversations."
measures to tackle illegal bird-feeding,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development since January 2020 (a) how many enforcement notices have been issued for bird-feeding offences; (b) how many bird-feeding offenders have been fined; and (c) whether the Ministry will be introducing new measures to tackle illegal bird-feeding.,"Mr Desmond Lee: Since January 2020, NParks has issued 31 enforcement notices for bird-feeding offences. Of these, 18 were issued composition notices. NParks adopts a suite of measures to deter illegal bird-feeding, including camera surveillance at identified feeding hotspots, and working with Town Councils to carry out enforcement operations.NParks has strengthened its regulatory regime with the enhanced Wildlife Act, which came into force on 1 June 2020. The Act allows NParks to impose stiffer penalties for the illegal feeding of wildlife, including birds. Offenders can be fined up to $5,000 for the feeding of any wild bird, up from $500 for feeding pigeons before the Wildlife Act came into force.Public education and engagement is key. NParks works with Town Councils, MSO, and PA to engage feeders. This enables NParks to find out their motivations, address misconceptions, and discourage them from continuing to feed birds.In February 2020, NParks piloted the Pigeon Management Plan in partnership with four Town Councils of Tanjong Pagar, Pasir Ris-Punggol, Jalan Besar, and Bishan-Toa Payoh. This pilot adopts a multi-pronged approach comprising food source reduction, habitat modification measures such as nettings to prevent nesting, and population reduction. NParks will study the findings from the pilot, with a view of scaling the implementation to other areas."
proposal for new committee to study enthanasia of healthy pet dogs,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether it will set up an independent committee comprising stakeholders such as veterinarians, animal welfare groups, dog trainers, and dog owners to study the issue of euthanasia of physically healthy pet dogs; (b) if so, what is the Ministry's timeline for setting up this committee; and (c) if not, how will the Ministry ensure that the stakeholders are adequately engaged.","Mr Desmond Lee: All parties, including veterinarians, animal welfare groups, dog trainers, and dog owners, have a duty of care to the pets under their charge. In particular, owning a pet comes with important obligations and should not be entered into lightly.There are safeguards in place regarding euthanasia of pet dogs. The Code of Ethics for Veterinarians states that veterinarians must consider other treatment options prior to considering euthanasia. It also allows for veterinarians to reject an owner’s request for euthanasia, should he or she deem it inappropriate. NParks works closely with the Singapore Veterinary Association to review the Code of Ethics and ensure that it remains up to date with developments in the veterinary industry and international best practices. Nonetheless, NParks has received suggestions from various stakeholders and is studying them carefully. NParks will engage relevant stakeholders, as part of the ongoing pet sector review"
enforcement of compliance with maintenance payments in divorce cases,"Ms Tin Pei Ling asked the Minister for Social and Family Development given the importance of having both parents involved in raising of a child despite a divorce, how will the Ministry ensure that a maintenance order is fully complied with especially if the parent ordered to pay maintenance has the financial means to do so.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: We agree that it is important for both parents to be involved in raising their children despite a divorce.However, there will be cases where a parent deliberately neglects or refuses to provide maintenance. This is why MSF had worked with the Family Justice Courts to introduce the Maintenance Record Officer (MRO) scheme in 2016. One of the MRO’s functions is to assist the Family Justice Courts to gather information and submit an assessment of why the parent has defaulted on providing maintenance – that is, whether the parent is unable to pay, or unwilling to pay. If the parent has the financial means to pay but is unwilling to do so, the Family Justice Courts can consider whether harsher penalties should be meted out for non-compliance.Maintenance default may also occur where there is genuine financial hardship. In such instances, the families are referred to Social Service Offices for financial assistance.MSF and the Family Justice Courts will continue to review the maintenance enforcement regime to enhance compliance."
spike in households' utility bills in july and august 2020,Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what are the reasons for a spike in households' utility bills in July and August 2020; (b) whether there are errors in the meter readings; and (c) whether there are any increases in the prices of utilities.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: Electricity and town gas tariffs had decreased in the third quarter of 2020, and there had been no change in water prices during this period.However, three reasons could have contributed to higher household utility bills in recent months, compared to earlier this year. First, households’ utility consumption in Singapore is typically higher during the warmer months from April to August as households use more electricity for fans or air-conditioners. In the past five years, the average monthly electricity consumption during April to August is typically 8% higher than in other months.Second, households’ utility consumption increased since April, as Singaporeans spent more time at home during the circuit breaker period and early stages of our phased reopening, as part of our national efforts to manage local community transmissions of COVID-19. Third, physical meter readings by SP Group were suspended in April and May 2020 during the circuit breaker period. Households’ utility consumption during this period were estimated using data from February and March 2020, which is an under-estimation. The higher consumption in April to May was reflected in households’ utility bills in June and July 2020, after physical meter readings resumed in June 2020, which could have led to the higher utility bills. We have provided Singaporean households with more support for their utility bills this year. Every household with at least one Singapore Citizen received a one-off $100 Solidarity Utilities Credit in their July or August SP Group utility bill. Eligible HDB households also received the GST Voucher – U-Save, which has been doubled this year through a one-off GST Voucher U-Save Special Payment. Eligible HDB households with five or more members will also receive a further GST Voucher – U-Save rebate."
impact of covid-19 pandemic on construction of extended cycling path network,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Transport whether he can provide an update on the progress of the construction of the extended cycling path network and the delay to be expected given the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 crisis.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: Due to COVID-19, which affected the availability of cycling path construction materials and workers, there may be delays of up to 12 months for the completion of cycling path projects. The Government remains committed to tripling our cycling paths from 460km now to around 1300km by 2030, under the Islandwide Cycling Network. This will support the uptake of active mobility in a way that is safe and convenient for all path users. "
one-off extension of hospitalisation insurance policies to cover elective surgeries postponed due to covid-19,Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Prime Minister whether the Government will advise healthcare insurers to provide a one-off extension of hospitalisation policies to cover elective surgeries that have been postponed due to the COVID-19 circuit breaker restrictions.,"Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): Due to COVID-19, many elective surgeries were put on hold since February this year. The Ministry of Health has announced that from 2 June, medical procedures for patients with higher needs will resume, while the less urgent elective medical procedures may continue to be deferred.The postponement of elective surgeries should not result in any loss of health insurance coverage for policyholders. All Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents are covered under MediShield Life for the lifetime of the policyholder, and will not be affected by the deferment of the surgeries.As for those who have taken on additional health coverage. These include Integrated Shield Plans (IPs), other types of individual medical expense plans, and employer-based group medical expense policies. These policies are typically renewed every year, either by the individual or the employer, which means that coverage under these policies will also not be affected by the deferment of surgeries.However, there may be some instances where the policyholder does not, or is unable to, renew a private health policy, and hence coverage is affected by the postponement of the elective surgery. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has informed insurers of its expectations that they treat customers fairly and consider these claims favourably if the postponement of these procedures was solely due to COVID-19. Policyholders are advised to approach their insurers to discuss the circumstances of their claims. If that fails, they can appeal through their Members of Parliament or directly to MAS."
applications received and approved for self-employed income relief scheme,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Manpower to date, how many applications from self-employed adults below the age of 37 under the Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme have been received and how many of these applications have been successful.","Mrs Josephine Teo: The Self-Employed Person (SEP) Income Relief Scheme (SIRS) helps Singaporean SEPs with less means and family support tide over this period of economic uncertainty. There is readily available information for auto-inclusion of SEPs aged 37 and above. The SEPs would have been previously assessed for eligibility under the Workfare Income Supplement scheme. This approach enabled over 100,000 SEPs to receive SIRS support without the need to apply for it. To ensure deserving SEPs aged below 37 receive SIRS support, we accept applications for SIRS through the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC). So far, NTUC has received 20,500 applications from SEPs under the age of 37 that met the eligibility criteria and processed payments. A further 9,100 applications were incomplete and will be assessed for eligibility when applicants revert.  "
measures to boost immunity and increase awareness for strengthening of personal immunity,Mr Chong Kee Hiong asked the Minister for Health (a) what measures will be implemented to boost immunity amongst the general population; and (b) whether there are age-group specific practices which can be included in public education information materials and broadcasts to increase awareness about strengthening personal immunity.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: There is currently no effective vaccine to boost immunity against COVID-19.However, keeping healthy will help ensure that our immune system is functioning properly. This means a well-balanced diet with sufficient intake of fluids, adequate physical activity, as well as having enough sleep and rest. Smokers should quit smoking as there is evidence linking tobacco smoke1 with immune dysfunction. Similarly, alcohol consumption2 should be avoided as it impairs the body's ability to defend against infection. For persons with chronic conditions such as hypertension or diabetes, particularly among our seniors, complying with medication and regular medical follow-up to ensure that their condition remains under control is important to keep up the body's defences against infection. They should also go for the vaccinations recommended under the National Adult Immunisation Schedule (NAIS), such as vaccinations against seasonal flu and pneumococcal diseases.It is equally important to take care of one's mental well-being3 during this period. Taking up one or two hobbies such as music, reading a book or learning a new skill online, as well as using relaxation techniques, can help improve mental well-being.  The Health Promotion Board (HPB) launched the ""Stay Well to Stay Strong"" campaign in February to provide Singaporeans with bite-sized videos and articles on practising good personal hygiene, healthy eating, physical activity, and mental well-being. With Singaporeans staying at home during the circuit breaker period, this has proven to be a valuable resource. In a span of three months from February till mid-May 2020, HPB's resources on the Stay Well to Stay Strong resource hub have seen over 360,000 page views, with a 17-fold increase in monthly viewership since inception. There are over 162,000 views of the exercise videos, a 13-fold increase in monthly viewership since the campaign started.For seniors, who may use social media less often, Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) and HPB have partnered Mediacorp to roll out the ""Learn Together with Me Season 2"" television series on Channel 8, as well as the ""Stay Well to Stay Strong"" series in Malay and Tamil on Suria and Vasantham respectively. Viewership for the Channel 8 series averaged 113,000 people aged 50 and above per episode; the other two series are currently on air. Amidst the ongoing COVID-19 situation, we will continue to provide Singaporeans with various health initiatives and use alternative platforms to encourage Singaporeans to remain healthy. "
measures and penalties to ensure dormitory operators and landlords comply with requirements for communal living,"Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling asked the Minister for Manpower (a) apart from periodic checks by the enforcement team, what more will be done to ensure that dormitory operators and landlords that provide lodging for foreign workers comply with rules for communal living; and (b) whether there will be tougher penalties for failure to comply such as the suspension of their operating licence and repossession of the rental flats or houses.","Mrs Josephine Teo: The Inter-Agency Taskforce is systematically testing to clear all dormitories of COVID-19 infections in the coming months. Before residents are allowed to resume work, all parties, including dormitory operators, employers and workers, are required to implement safe management and safe living measures to ensure migrant workers work and live in a safe environment.  Besides implementing safe management measures to prepare for the re-opening of workplaces, employers are also required to cooperate with the dormitory operators to facilitate the testing and clearing of their workers in the dormitories. These include confirming and updating the addresses of their workers in the Online Foreign Worker Address Service (OFWAS) and working with the dormitory operators stagger pick-up and drop-off time and provide dedicated transport for their workers to and from the workplaces.  Dormitory operators are required to implement safe living measures to minimise the risk of transmissions in the dormitories. These measures include tracking the entry and exit of residents and visitors in and out of the dormitories, limiting the inter-mixing of residents such as by staggering the use of common facilities, and strengthening the health surveillance of dormitory residents to identify residents who display symptoms of infection and isolate them quickly. In addition, we are working with the dormitory operators to progressively reduce the density of the existing dormitories by re-housing workers in the new temporary dormitories as they come online. This will allow the existing dormitories to provide more living space per resident to reduce the risk of transmission of infectious diseases in the dormitories. Finally, workers also have an important role to play to ensure that rules for communal living are complied with. For example, they are responsible to monitor their health conditions daily, abide by the rules set up by the dormitory operators to minimise physical interactions with residents from other blocks, and promptly report to their dormitory operators and employers if they are feeling unwell. To help employers and dormitory operators to understand and implement these measures effectively, MOM has provided relevant advisories and checklists and conducted briefings for the dormitory operators. To help foreign workers better understand their responsibilities, we have produced simple communications materials, such as infographics, in the workers’ key native languages for employers and dormitory operators to educate their workers and residents with. We have also tapped on mobile applications for foreign workers and foreign worker ambassadors from the Migrant Workers' Centre to reach out to the workers. Besides engagement and outreach efforts, there will be penalties and consequences on each party if they do not do their part. Employers who fail to fulfil their responsibilities may be fined up to $10,000 or jailed up to 12 months, or both under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (EFMA). They may also be debarred from employing foreign workers. Dormitory operators who fail to put in place safe living measures at the dormitories can face a fine of up to $50,000 or imprisonment term of up to 12 months, or both, per contravention. Operators licensed under the Foreign Employee Dormitories Act (FEDA) may also have their operating licence revoked. Private property owners or landlords who have not complied with these measures will not be allowed to rent out their properties or flats to foreign workers. To ensure that workers comply with the safe living measures in the dormitories, dormitory operators are to set clear house rules and corresponding consequences for non-compliance. All cases of non-compliance have to be reported to the Ministry of Manpower (MOM). Workers who repeatedly breach house rules pose a risk to others and may have their work passes revoked. "
mental healthcare provisions for work permit holders,Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what mental healthcare is provided for work permit holders residing in (i) dormitories (ii) factory-converted dormitories (iii) onsite temporary quarters and (iv) other residences; (b) how are these measures communicated to (i) work permit holders and (ii) their employers; (c) how does the Ministry work with NGOs in expanding support to work permit holders for their mental health needs; (d) whether the Ministry will establish for work permit holders (i) a dedicated mental wellness hotline that funnels to the respective NGOs and (ii) ground consultation teams staffed with mental healthcare professionals.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) partners with NGOs, such as Migrant Workers' Centre (MWC) and Healthserve, to meet the mental well-being needs of foreign workers living in dormitories and other forms of housing. The Migrant Workers' Centre has an existing 24 hours helpline manned by MWC staff where workers can call in for assistance on any issues, or if they just need a listening ear. In April, Healthserve launched a dedicated mental wellness hotline where workers can access important medical information and submit their requests for tele-counselling sessions. These tele-counselling sessions are conducted by more than 100 trained volunteer counsellors in the foreign workers' native languages. Since April, Healthserve's hotline has received more than 4,000 enquiries and more than 300 workers have signed up for their tele-counselling sessions. Workers who are in distress for any reason can call either the MWC or the Healthserve hotline.In addition, our FAST teams and MWC's network of 5,000 Foreign Worker Ambassadors proactively look out for residents, whom they assess may benefit from the service, and refer them to a mental health counsellor. Depending on the group size, Healthserve may tap on their pool of more than 30 volunteer Psychiatrists for a remote group counselling, or activate a counsellor for one-to-one tele-counselling session with the worker. More than 150 cases have been referred to Healthserve so far. Besides counselling services, Healthserve and MWC also provide financial assistance to help foreign workers in financial distress.  To ensure dormitory residents are informed of the available support channels including the MWC and Healthserve hotlines, MOM sends out regular bulletins highlighting the help that organisations such as MWC and Healthserve can offer. Videos produced by Healthserve on upholding mental health have also been shared among the residents. At the dormitories, posters are put up to inform residents of when they should seek help and how. Additionally, all first-time non-Malaysian work permit holders are required to attend a mandatory one-day Settling-in Programme where they are taught the avenues and given the hotline numbers to seek help if they are stressed or depressed.  "
rehoming and implementing controls over euthanising healthy dogs or cats,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for National Development with regard to people seeking to euthanise their healthy dog or cat (a) whether the Ministry will make it compulsory for them to produce documented proof that they have (i) attempted to rehome the animal and (ii) received certification from an Animal and Veterinary Service-accredited trainer that the animal, if aggressive, is untrainable; and (b) whether it will be made compulsory for veterinarians to wait for a pre-determined length of time before euthanising the animal, during which the animal's details are published on websites of NParks and animal welfare groups to facilitate rehoming.","Mr Lawrence Wong: All veterinarians in Singapore must comply with the Code of Ethics for Veterinarians. Under the Code, veterinarians are required to take into account public safety and animal welfare in deciding on the course of treatment for an animal. The Code states that veterinarians must consider other treatment options prior to considering euthanasia. It also allows veterinarians to reject an owner's request for euthanasia, should he or she deem it inappropriate. Failure to comply with the Code can result in enforcement action being taken against the veterinarian.Mr Ng has raised several suggestions, which we will consider carefully, and in consultation with all stakeholders. In particular, NParks will continue to work with the Singapore Veterinary Association on these matters, and ensure that the Code of Ethics remains up to date with developments in the veterinary industry and international best practices. NParks will also continue to work with its partners to promote awareness of behavioural training options and rehoming avenues amongst pet owners. All parties, be it pet owners, animal welfare groups, dog trainers, or veterinarians, have duties and responsibilities regarding the adoption and euthanasia of pets. We will need everyone to do their part, even as we continue to update our regulatory rules and requirements. "
monitoring payment modes of salaries to foreign workers living in dormitories,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Manpower (a) currently, what number and percentage of employers with foreign workers residing in dormitories (i) declared that they will pay salaries electronically (ii) paid salaries electronically and (iii) paid salaries in cash; (b) what specific steps, other than relying on worker complaints, does the Ministry take to monitor employers who are paying salaries in cash are correctly paying their foreign workers residing in dormitories; and (c) what are the exceptional circumstances under which employers are permitted to pay workers residing in dormitories in cash.","Mrs Josephine Teo: As is the case for all employees whether local or foreign, they must step forward to inform MOM if they have been paid an incorrect salary. It is in their own interest to do so in a timely manner.Since April 2020, MOM has been requiring employers of foreign workers, especially those with workers staying in the dormitories, to make declarations on the status and mode of salary payment to their workers. This is an additional precaution that MOM has introduced proactively, to track the payment of salaries to foreign workers to intervene early in cases where salaries are owed. We also required employers to pay salaries electronically to ensure that workers can receive their salaries even if they are unable to leave the dormitories.The vast majority of employers contacted declared to MOM that they would pay April 2020 salaries electronically. A very small number of employers declared that they were unable to do so, citing technical or administrative issues. Such employers were allowed to pay outstanding salaries in cash at dormitories where the risk of COVID-19 transmission was assessed to be low. MOM is following up on every case in which the employer declared that he owed salaries, or a dormitory worker reported that he was owed salaries. Should workers face any salary issues, they can raise them with the Forward Assurance & Support Team (FAST) officers on the ground, so that MOM can follow up with their employers."
review of convertible bonds for retail investors,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Prime Minister whether MAS will review if convertible bonds should be issued, marketed, sold or traded to retail investors in light of the complexity and risks associated with these hybrid securities.","Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): In regulating the sale of investment products, Monetary Authority of Singapore's (MAS) objective is to empower investors to make informed investment decisions which are compatible with their investment objectives, risk appetite, and financial situation. Our approach has worked well so far, and is a common approach adopted by many advanced jurisdictions.Hence, for complex investment products which the average retail investor may not understand, MAS requires financial institutions (FIs) to implement various safeguards, including:First, assessing a customer's investment knowledge and experience before selling the product to the customer;Second, explaining to the customer the general features and risks associated with investing in such products; orThird, advising the customer on the suitability of the product.Convertible bonds are currently classified as non-complex as the product is well-established in the market, and the terms and features can be understood by most retail investors. It is sold as a bond, and stays as a bond, unless the investor or the issuer decides to convert it to equity.However, in recent years, issuers have introduced non-conventional convertible bonds with features that retail investors may not be familiar with. For example, certain bonds may not have a fixed maturity date or may be converted to equity upon the occurrence of certain trigger events which are beyond the investor's control. MAS is therefore reviewing the classification of these products and other hybrid securities. MAS expects to issue a public consultation paper by the end of the year."
impact of covid-19 pandemic on implementation dates of careshield life and medisave care,Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked the Minister for Health whether the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic will affect the implementation dates of (i) CareShield Life and (ii) MediSave Care.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: CareShield Life is a new long-term care insurance scheme, and MediSave Care provides cash withdrawals for long-term care needs. Both schemes were originally planned for launch in mid-2020. In light of various steps taken amidst the current COVID-19 pandemic, such as safe distancing precautions and the circuit breaker measures, there has been a reduced pace of development and testing work that can be undertaken by teams across our implementing agencies and vendors. This has caused a delay in the completion of IT systems needed to implement both CareShield Life and MediSave Care. As such, both schemes will be launched by end 2020.CareShield Life will be launched first for future cohorts, who are Singaporeans born in 1980 or later. Singaporeans in these cohorts who are aged 30 to 40 years old in 2020 will be covered from end 2020, while those aged 29 or younger in 2020 will be covered when they turn 30. The delay will also affect the launch date of CareShield Life for existing cohorts, who are Singaporeans born 1979 or earlier. This was originally planned for mid-2021. The launch date will now minimally be deferred till end 2021. MOH will review the situation and announce more details on the launch dates for future and existing cohorts when ready.In the meantime, disabled Singaporeans and their caregivers who require assistance can continue to receive help from existing disability assistance schemes, such as the Home Caregiving Grant, Interim Disability Assistance Programme for the Elderly and ElderFund. If they require additional support for living costs, they can also tap on other schemes such as ComCare, the Temporary Relief Fund and the COVID-19 Support Grant."
reports of spalling concrete in owned and rental hdb flats in last three years,"Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for National Development for each of the past three years, how many reports of spalling concrete has HDB received for (i) owned and (ii) rental HDB flats respectively.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Spalling concrete is a result of natural wear and tear due to the corrosion of steel reinforcement bars embedded in concrete floor slabs. The corrosion is caused by moisture and acids in the concrete which can build up over time. Spalling concrete can be minimised through surface maintenance such as regular painting of the ceiling. If ceiling surfaces are regularly maintained, and any spalling concrete is detected early, spalling concrete is usually minor and can be easily repaired.   For sold flats, flat owners are responsible for the maintenance of the interior of their flats. We encourage flat owners to regularly inspect their ceilings for signs of spalling concrete, and to undertake the necessary maintenance and repairs. In the last three years, Housing and Development Board (HDB) received a yearly average of 10 reported cases of spalling concrete per 1,000 sold flats, and 23 reported cases of spalling concrete per 1,000 rental flats. "
medical consensus on blood clotting abnormalities in covid-19 patients,Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Health (a) whether there is a medical consensus on the blood clotting abnormalities seen with COVID-19 patients; (b) whether the Ministry is looking at overseas data to guide Singapore; (c) what measures are being taken in the dormitories to detect blood clots early; (d) what support is given to conduct research on this growing concern; and (e) whether the Ministry will give priority to fast-track such research.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: I thank the Member for the question, which has been addressed to a similar question filed by Mr Leon Perera on 4 June 2020."
disease-testing for wild-caught soft-shelled turtles imported for consumption,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources with regard to the import of wild-caught soft-shelled turtle for consumption (a) what diseases are the animals tested for; (b) for each disease, how many tests have been carried out in each year for the past five years; (c) for each disease, what are the number and percentage of test results that have been positive in each year for the past five years; and (d) whether the Ministry will start collecting this data if it is not already doing so.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) takes a science-based risk assessment approach to manage food safety from farm to fork. For imports of food, SFA imposes control measures that are calibrated based on the assessed food safety risks. Importers must be licensed, and apply for import permits for each consignment of food imported into Singapore, which facilitates food traceability and recalls if any food safety infringements are found. SFA also conducts regular food safety inspections and testing of the end product to ensure that food sold in Singapore complies with our food safety standards and requirements.Such control measures are applied to the import and slaughter of turtle for food in Singapore. Approximately 95% of all the turtles, including wild-caught soft shell turtles, which are imported for food are slaughtered and processed into meat products at a SFA-licensed local slaughterhouse, with the remaining live turtles being distributed to the four wet market stallholders within one market for sale. Given that the food safety and disease transmission risk associated with the import, slaughter and sale of turtles is low, SFA does not test for diseases in imported turtles which are sold live. Nevertheless, as part of SFA’s inspection regime, SFA conducts random sampling and testing of turtle meat products, including those from the SFA-licensed slaughterhouse, for foodborne pathogens such as Shigella species and Vibrio cholerae (pronounced as vee-brio collar-rae).Over the past five years, SFA has collected a total of 63 samples of turtle meat products and conducted 129 laboratory tests on these samples. All test results showed that the samples met SFA's food safety and hygiene requirements with no foodborne pathogens detected. Thus far, there have not been any foodborne outbreaks associated with the consumption of turtles.In line with ongoing efforts to improve public health and environmental hygiene standards in Singapore, SFA will continue to be vigilant in its inspection regime and tighten requirements for food safety when necessary. However, the assurance of food safety is a joint responsibility across the industry, consumers and the Government. To prevent foodborne illnesses, food handlers and consumers should also observe good food safety and hygiene practices, such as the washing of hands with soap and water before and after handling any raw meat, and by thoroughly cooking the meat, which helps to kill any harmful bacteria."
"impact of recent commodity trade ""blow-ups"" on singapore's reputation as commodity trading hub and need to strengthen regulatory frameworks",Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) whether recent commodity trade blow-ups in Singapore will impact our reputation as a commodity trading hub; (b) whether there is a need to strengthen regulatory frameworks; and (c) how are financial irregularities kept at the minimum and adequately penalised to ensure Singapore remains a fair and safe hub to conduct trading.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: Approximately 80 percent of the world's largest entities in the energy, agriculture, and metals and mining sectors have made Singapore their home for international trading. This makes Singapore one of the top three global trading hubs along with Geneva and London. Singapore is regarded as an attractive location by global trading companies due to our robust legal framework, open and competitive marketplace with a large pool of counterparties, and strong financial and shipping sectors. Members would be aware of the recent news of a few high-profile cases in the commodity trading sector. While I am unable to comment on specific cases that are undergoing investigations, let me set out some principles that underpin our regulatory philosophy. First, trading companies, like all commercial entities, must abide by Singapore's penal code and commercial laws. Instances of fraud are punishable by a fine, imprisonment, or both.Second, like Geneva and London, we apply a risk-based regulatory regime. For example, companies that deal with retail customers in commodity derivatives and spot commodities, are licenced and regulated under the Securities and Futures Act and Commodity Trading Act respectively. Those that transact only in commodities derivatives and spot commodities on their own account, and do not solicit funds from members of the public, are currently exempt from licencing. Such companies are subject to credit assessments by their lenders and counterparties, and market best practices. Following the recent cases, Enterprise Singapore and the Monetary Authority of Singapore are reviewing the disclosure and lending practices in trading companies and their financing banks respectively, to consider if additional measures are needed to increase transparency and trust in the industry.Third, we review our regulatory regime regularly to continue to ensure that we are in line with global standards and ensure that we remain a fair and safe trading hub for all market participants."
help for residents who cannot afford mobile phones to access online programmes,"Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng asked the Minister for Communications and Information whether the Ministry can list the kinds of help made available for residents, especially seniors, who cannot afford mobile phones to access the numerous online programmes that are useful to them.","Mr S Iswaran: Digital inclusion has always been a Government priority, and is doubly important during this COVID-19 period. This applies to our seniors, although we recognise that we need to continue to engage seniors using multiple channels, including digital and many non-digital means like TV and radio programmes, as well as ground engagements. Even as we continue keeping these non-digital channels available, we must continue forging ahead on our efforts to equip every Singaporean with access to digital devices, as well as the skills to use them.To support low-income households to afford digital devices and Internet connection, Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) has been running the Home Access programme since 2014, which provides two years of subsidised broadband and the option for a subsidised smartphone or tablet. More than 16,000 households have benefited since the start of the programme. IMDA also runs the NEU PC Plus Programme, which provides a subsidised PC and free broadband to low-income households with school-going children or with persons with disabilities. Together, these programmes support our residents, including seniors, with digital connectivity. For more vulnerable seniors, the CareLine programme by Changi General Hospital provides 24/7 emergency response, as well as care and social support, such as medication reminders and tele-befriending. Changi General Hospital has partnered with Temasek Foundation and the Agency for Integrated Care to provide mobile phones and mobile plans to needy seniors with little or no family support, so that they can access CareLine. Even as seniors stay home to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infections, they will have peace of mind knowing that care is just a call away. Service providers can also use digital technology to monitor their wellbeing and convey important messages on COVID-19.Beyond digital access, individuals need to be equipped with relevant digital skills. To address skill gaps, including amongst seniors, there are various ongoing digital upskilling initiatives in the community. For instance, IMDA's Digital Clinics and the Tech Connect service at various Community Centres provide one-to-one support to address seniors' questions over smartphone usage. Various community partners and social service agencies also run Silver Infocomm Junctions to help seniors upskill themselves digitally. With the support of corporate volunteers from companies like Cognizant, Grab, and Microsoft, IMDA and National Library Board (NLB) have also recently launched online learning platforms, such as Virtual Digital Clinics, where seniors can have their digital questions answered remotely during the circuit breaker. We recognise the importance of bringing more seniors on board this digital journey, especially during this COVID-19 situation where digital solutions can help safeguard our seniors' health and improve their quality of lives substantially. For example, seniors can remain digitally connected through video-calls with their friends and family, even as they stay home. We will thus be embarking on a nation-wide ""Seniors Go Digital"" movement, as mentioned by the Deputy Prime Minister in his Ministerial Statement last week, to inspire seniors to widen their horizons through digital adoption, and equip them with the digital skills to do so. As part of ""Seniors Go Digital"", we will provide needy seniors who aspire to go digital but lack the financial means to do so, with financial support to have phones. Minister Iswaran will announce more details shortly. Everyone has a part to play. For those of us who have seniors at home, we can encourage them to come on board this digital journey and guide them in picking up digital skills. Businesses and community players can also contribute; many have come forward during this challenging period to support donation efforts that provide digital devices to those in need. Together, we can help our seniors go digital in meaningful and sustainable ways."
"guidelines on purpose, duration, process and substance of public consultations by government agencies","Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) in each of the last five years, how many public consultations launched by the Government were (i) two weeks or shorter (ii) more than two weeks and less than one month and (iii) more than one month; (b) how does the agency decide the duration of the public consultation; (c) whether the Government will ensure that all public consultations run for no shorter than one month to allow sufficient time for organisations and individuals to consult adequately and provide higher-quality responses; and (d) whether the Government will issue a Code of Practice for all agencies to adopt regarding the purpose, duration, process and substance of public consultations.","Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: The Government uses the REACH website to seek views from members of the public across a range of issues. From 2016 to 2020, the REACH website hosted a total of 113 public consultations for new policies and draft legislation. Fifty-eight of these consultations lasted from between two weeks to one month, and 53 lasted more than one month. However, these consultations published on REACH's website represent only a slice of our overall engagement efforts. The Government engages and partners the public and stakeholders in many other ways, such as through dialogues, people-private-public (3P) committees, and focus group discussions. Recent major efforts include SGFuture (2015 -2016), which provided a platform for Singaporeans to discuss their hopes and dreams for the nation and to embark on their own projects, the Committee on the Future Economy (2017) that convened industry leaders to make recommendations for Singapore's economic growth, and public consultation on the Land Transport Master Plan 2040 (2018). The engagement mode must be fit-for-purpose, and so its design, duration, and target audience will vary according to the policy issue at hand.Ms Ong asked if there will be a Code of Practice for public consultations. I agree with Ms Ong that we need to continually improve in how we engage the public. I am pleased to inform Ms Ong that the Public Service has many on-going efforts to level up agencies' and officers' engagement capabilities. We offer a suite of training programmes and resources that distill the principles and best practices of public engagement, and we constantly enhance these as we learn from experience and external experts. There are also field guides and digital tools to help agencies carry out engagements that best meet their objectives, and ensure a meaningful experience for their stakeholders. Over the years, the Government has moved beyond just consulting, to partnering Singaporeans to co-create and co-deliver solutions for a better Singapore. This was reinforced when Deputy Prime Minister launched the Singapore Together movement in June 2019. Today, we have even more avenues for citizens to be involved in designing policies and innovating new solutions. In the past year, the Recycle Right Citizens' Workgroup (2019), and the SG Youth Action Plan (2019) have demonstrated the power of citizens and Government working together for a common cause. Our COVID-19 experience has also seen many examples of citizen and community groups stepping forward to partner the Government, to strengthen our healthcare system by volunteering, care for migrant workers, and rally Singaporeans' spirits in these challenging times.  Singapore Together is a new model of governance where Government, community and businesses partner each other, to build our future Singapore, together. This is especially important now. Only by working together, united in purpose, will we emerge from this COVID-19 situation stronger as a nation. I invite all my Parliamentary colleagues to join us in this Singapore Together movement. "
help for home team officers in light of additional roles during covid-19 pandemic,"Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Home Affairs what has been done, and what will continue to be done, to care for our home team officers as they take on additional roles to enforce law and order issues surrounding the fight against COVID-19.","Mr K Shanmugam: The Home Team officers are deeply involved in the COVID-19 crisis, from coordinating the whole-of-Government response at the Public Service level and supporting the Multi-Ministry Task Force, to implementing COVID-19 border policies and measures, supporting MOH in contact tracing, and enforcing Stay-Home Notices and egregious breaches of safe distancing. The Home Team has put in place various measures to protect and support the officers. Home Team Departments have implemented split teams and safe distancing at workplaces. Officers who can work from home will do so. Temperature checks are conducted twice daily to ensure that our officers are well before they perform their duties. We are delivering more services using automation or through digital means to reduce physical contact.For officers who may have to come into contact with potential COVID-19 cases, for example SCDF's Emergency Medical Services personnel, and Home Team officers helping manage the situation at Government quarantine facilities and foreign worker dormitories, they will don the necessary personal protection equipment (PPE), such as mask, face shield, gloves, cap and goggles. Alternative accommodation is arranged upon request for officers deployed for COVID-19 related operations, to minimise contact with their family members during the period of deployment. We are also mindful about the mental well-being of our officers during this period. Supervisors and commanders engage the officers to gather feedback, motivate and raise morale. Self-care materials and guides are disseminated to officers on a regular basis. We have also distributed ""care packs"" which include personal items, such as reusable masks, Vitamin C supplements, and hand sanitisers.Home Team psychologists and in-house para-counsellors look out for distressed officers. Home Team Departments have also intensified the manning of counselling helplines.  The Ministry will support and care for our officers working on Singapore's response to COVID-19. "
complaints by foreign domestic workers during covid-19 pandemic,"Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the number of complaints lodged by foreign domestic workers (FDWs) since the COVID-19 pandemic started; and (b) what kinds of assistance, in particular mental health support, are available to FDWs facing conflict with their employers.","Mrs Josephine Teo: Over the past three months, the Ministry received an average of about eight complaints per 10,000 FDWs each month. This is comparable to the average number of complaints we received in the same period last year. While some FDWs had concerns about not having suitable or enough food, others had issues with their workload. The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) investigates all complaints seriously and will take the party responsible to task in accordance with our laws. We will also provide whatever assistance and support we can to the aggrieved party. Apart from raising their concerns to MOM, FDWs who face stress at work or require advice have access to various avenues of support. Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) like the Centre for Domestic Employees (CDE) and the Foreign Domestic Worker Association for Social Support and Training (FAST) each maintain a 24-hour helpline for FDWs. In addition, CDE partners mental health advocacy organisations, such as the Silver Ribbon to provide counselling services for FDWs who need someone to talk to. FAST has also developed various meaningful e-activities for FDWs to participate in, such as online mental resilience talks and exercise programmes, like Zumba, Pilates and yoga sessions, to help FDWs recharge and keep healthy. As we all adjust to the disruptions in our households due to COVID-19, we encourage employers and FDWs to maintain open communication with each other and exercise extra understanding and sensitivity to each other's needs. FDWs are an important part of our households and we will continue to work with our partners to safeguard their well-being in Singapore."
updated budget deficit forecast for fy 2020/2021 after budget and supplementary budget announcements,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) whether he can provide an updated budget deficit forecast for FY 2020/2021, after the main Budget and supplementary Budget statements up to and including 26 May 2020; (b) how much of this is financed via a reserves drawdown, by utilising the accumulated surplus from the current term of Government and by other means, respectively; and (c) what is the nature of the other means of financing, if any.","Mr Heng Swee Keat: The four Budgets in 2020 have deployed a total of $92.9 billion to support our economy and society in fighting COVID-19, and to position ourselves to emerge stronger. The Overall Budget Deficit for FY2020 is $74.3 billion or 15.4% of GDP. The Government will draw $31 billion from past reserves to fund the measures announced in the Fortitude Budget. Taken together with the earlier $21 billion draw from past reserves for the Resilience and Solidarity packages, we are drawing a total of up to $52 billion from past reserves to fund Singapore's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Loan capital, which we expect to be repaid in the future and is hence fiscally neutral, makes up $22 billion of the total COVID-19 package. The remainder will be funded by the Government using current reserves. This comprises the accumulated surplus in this term of Government, including expected fiscal upside from FY2019 revenue and expenditure updated after the close of the financial year.  Singapore's fiscal response to COVID-19 is significant and we are able to do so as we have been prudent and have accumulated surpluses over the years. Our reserves are our strategic asset, built up through the discipline and prudence of our people and political leaders, across generations. Because we have prepared ourselves well, Singapore has the resources to meet this crisis with confidence. "
assessment of overseas reports of children with multi-system inflammatory syndromes linked to covid-19 and steps taken locally,Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Health what is the Ministry's assessment of overseas reports regarding children who may be affected by paediatric multi-system inflammatory syndromes linked to COVID-19 and what steps is the Ministry taking in Singapore to deal with this development.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Since end April 2020, countries, such as the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Spain and the United States of America have been reporting cases of children requiring intensive care due to a rare paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome. A possible link with COVID-19 infection was suggested because some of these children had tested positive for COVID-19 infection. However, no strong evidence of such a link has been seen so far in Asian countries, such as Korea, Taiwan, Japan and Singapore.In Singapore, as of 28 May, 61 patients below the age of 16 years have tested positive for COVID-19. These patients were either asymptomatic, or had only mild symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat, and diarrhoea. None of these patients had the symptoms suggestive of the multisystem inflammatory syndrome, or required intensive care or high dependency care.The Ministry of Health notes that this paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome remains very rare, and information is still emerging. Nevertheless, MOH is monitoring the situation closely, and had issued an advisory to all medical practitioners on 11 May 2020 to refer potential cases that present with clinical features suggestive of this condition to the Children's Emergency at the KK Women's and Children's Hospital and the National University Hospital. MOH has also advised paediatricians managing COVID-19 cases to be watchful for this condition. "
availability of tertiary-level courses related to e-sports,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Education (a) how many tertiary institutions currently offer e-sports related courses; and (b) whether there are plans to increase the number of e-sports related diploma and undergraduate courses to match the demand for a skilled workforce.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: The Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) currently do not offer any specific e-sports-related courses. At a young age, students will benefit from a broader set of competencies and skills, which can be relevant to the e-sports industry. These include courses in Game Design and Development, Infocomm Technology, Sports Management, Graphics and Sounds Design, Events Management and Data Science.Notwithstanding, some IHLs have worked with industry partners to incorporate aspects of e-sports into their curricula. For example, Republic Polytechnic has infused e-sports content into their Diploma in Business for students who have selected the Sport Management specialisation. These students can also take up internships or final-year projects in the e-sports industry, during which they are exposed to skills such as marketing, event management and logistics management. There are also opportunities beyond the formal curriculum. Students can join clubs such as NUS' E-Gaming Society (NUSEG) and SMU's eSports. SUTD also runs a gaming research centre called the Game Lab. "
"extension of wage subsidies under jobs support scheme to shareholder-directors with assessable incomes not exceeding $150,000","Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance whether the Ministry will extend the wage subsidies under the Jobs Support Scheme to shareholder-directors whose assessable incomes do not exceed $150,000 for the Year of Assessment 2019.","Mr Heng Swee Keat: We set an assessable income (AI) criterion of $100,000 or below to better target the Jobs Support Scheme at shareholder-directors who need more support. The AI criterion of $100,000 already corresponds to approximately the 80th percentile of personal income tax payers. With the current criterion, the JSS already benefits about 50,000 shareholder-directors. Shareholder-directors who have marginally missed the AI criterion, or have suffered a significant drop in income, can submit an appeal to IRAS. We will assess each appeal on its merits on a case-by-case basis. I would also like to add that all shareholder-directors continue to receive JSS payouts based on the wages paid to their local employees. They also benefit from other forms of business support, such as corporate income tax rebates and rental rebates. "
addressing workplace grievances of trainees hired under sgunited trainship programme,"Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Minister for Manpower as the trainees under the SGUnited Traineeships Programme are not in an employment relationship and are not covered by the employment laws, how can these trainees obtain assistance and support in the event of workplace grievances and issues including work injury and harassment.","Mrs Josephine Teo: Mrs Josephine Teo: Under the Workplace Safety and Health Act (WSHA), the host company is responsible to ensure that workplaces are safe and without any health risks to every person on its premises, including the SGUnited trainees. In the event of any harassment, TAFEP will assist and support trainees who encounter such incidents. TAFEP will advise the trainees on the actions they can take, such as reporting the incident to the HR or, if the conduct constitutes criminal conduct, to make a Police report. "
average duration between grant application and notification of decision for government’s business grant schemes,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) over the past three years, what is the average duration between grant application and notification of decision for each of the major business grant schemes administered by Enterprise Singapore (ESG) targeted at local enterprises; (b) what is the average duration between successful conclusion of a grant-funded business project and reimbursement of grant funding from ESG; and (c) what has been done to improve application and reimbursement procedures to help businesses innovate while maintaining cashflow.","Mr Chan Chun Sing: Enterprise Singapore (ESG) and our economic agencies adopt an enterprise-centric approach to support our companies to transform their business models, improve productivity and access new markets. This includes grants tailored to meet the needs of enterprises through the different stages of their growth.In processing the applications and claims, ESG’s aim is to do so as efficiently and expeditiously as possible, while ensuring accountability and safeguarding the integrity of the system. Broadly, the time taken to process grant applications and claims depends on two main factors – how complex is the project and whether the company has provided the required information in a complete and timely manner.We can expect processing time to be longer for grants that support projects that are more complex or require more customisation. For example, the Enterprise Development Grant (EDG) covers a wide range of supportable areas, from business strategy to automation. Each grant is tailored to meet the company’s needs. This means that each grant application will have its unique set of objectives, scope and cost components. Not surprisingly, it takes longer to approve EDG applications compared to more standard applications under schemes like Productivity Solutions Grant (PSG) and Market Readiness and Assistance (MRA). The average duration for EDG is seven weeks versus four weeks for PSG and MRA. For around 10% of applications which are more straightforward, the company will receive approval in about a week. This includes the time taken for applicants to respond to clarifications and to submit a complete set of documentation to ESG.  That brings me to the second factor, which is the completeness of information submitted by companies. Some companies readily provide the required information, which makes it quicker to process their applications and claims. However, when the documentation provided is not complete, ESG has a duty to clarify and check before approving the applications or disbursing public funds for the claims. This will inevitably slow down the process.  The average duration between submission of final claims and grant disbursement is between seven to 10 weeks across the three schemes. Where the documentation provided is clear and complete, disbursements can be made within two weeks. To help businesses better manage their cashflow, ESG will exercise flexibility in the grant disbursement schedule while ensuring that the final grant amounts are accurately disbursed. For EDG projects with high upfront costs, ESG may disburse the grant in stages according to project implementation milestones. In addition, government agencies have started using PayNow Corporate to speed up payments to businesses. ESG is planning to do likewise for EDG, MRA and PSG so that companies can receive the disbursements more quickly. We are also open to other suggestions on how ESG can further improve its application and claims process, to help companies during these difficult times.  "
incidence of blood clots and heart diseases in covid-19 patients in singapore,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Health to what extent are patients with COVID-19 experiencing above-average rates of blood clots and heart disease, as some research suggest is being seen amongst COVID-19 patients globally.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Ministry of Health has been monitoring the emerging data globally on the increased risks of blood clots and heart disease in COVID-19 patients. MOH issued an advisory to all doctors on 20 May 2020 to highlight the emerging data on these risks, to advise them to be watchful for cardiovascular symptoms in COVID-19 patients, and to provide guidance on the evaluation and management of such patients.Among our local cases so far, about one in 1000 experienced cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks and blood clots. Due to the small numbers, we are unable to definitively conclude whether this is higher than average compared to non-COVID patients here in Singapore. This is an ongoing area of research and MOH will continue to support studies on this issue.From international data, we know that patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit are at higher risk, as they are immobile for prolonged periods and may have multiple co-morbidities. For such cases, our doctors take extra precautions, such as monitoring their coagulation status or the propensity for the blood to clot closely. In some cases, anti-coagulants are used to prevent blood clot formation. However, use of anti-coagulants must be weighed against the risk of bleeding, and our doctors will decide on a case by case basis.In the dormitories, community care facilities and community recovery facilities, we have been educating workers and patients on preventive measures for cardiovascular complications, such as good hydration, staying active, smoking cessation, and early recognition of symptoms. They are advised to seek medical attention immediately if they feel unwell.As COVID-19 is a new disease, we are learning more about it as we go along. MOH will continue to monitor the emerging evidence, and work with our clinical experts to ensure the best possible care and outcomes for our COVID-19 patients. "
impact of covid-19 situation on singapore’s climate change commitments,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether Singapore will stay the course on fighting climate change and meet our climate change commitments despite the current upheavals in the energy market and the potential long-term economic impact arising from the COVID-19 situation.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The Government's current priority is to manage the COVID-19 outbreak and ensure the lives and livelihoods of Singaporeans, as well as those of our migrant worker community, are well taken care of. We are all in this together and we will spare no effort to make sure that Singapore comes through this COVID-19 crisis much better than before.Even as we continue with our efforts to suppress the outbreak and prepare our economy to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, we must not lose sight of the other global challenge of climate change, which remains the biggest threat facing humanity over the long term. As a small island city-state, Singapore remains highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. This is why we cannot let up our efforts to address climate change.  Recently in March, we released our long-term low-emissions development strategy and enhanced our 2030 climate pledge in support of the goals of the Paris Agreement. They contained bold aspirations and plans to guide our long-term development and ongoing work to effect a well-managed transition to a low-carbon economy. Despite the uncertainties presented by the COVID-19 situation, we decided to press ahead with these plans and submitted them early to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in March, as we wanted to send a strong signal to Singaporeans and the international community that Singapore remains fully committed to tackling climate change. They demonstrate our seriousness and commitment to support global climate action and move towards a low-carbon and climate resilient future. We hope that our early submission to the UNFCCC would encourage other Parties to do likewise and jump-start the process of early submissions, thereby strengthening the momentum of global climate action at this critical time. We also remain committed to climate action and are making good progress on our climate plans. Just last month, Energy Market Authority (EMA) announced that we had achieved our 2020 solar deployment target of 350 megawatt-peak. We are now pressing ahead with our plans to reach our more ambitious solar target of at least two gigawatt-peak by 2030. MEWR will play our part. As earlier announced at the Committee of Supply (COS) 2020, Public Utilities Board (PUB) will be deploying floating solar photovoltaic systems at Bedok, Lower Seletar, and Tengeh Reservoirs by 2021. With this, Singapore will be one of the few countries in the world to have 100% green waterworks. In the face of climate change challenges, Singapore cannot take food security for granted and we have made early moves to prepare ourselves. As early as 2019, my Ministry announced an ambitious ""30 by 30"" goal to produce 30 per cent of Singapore's nutritional needs locally by 2030. The COVID-19 situation has underscored the need to further enhance our food security and resilience. To this end, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) has just launched a $30 million ""30x30 Express"" grant call to accelerate the ramping up of local food production over the next six to 24 months.We are also pressing on with plans to protect Singapore from sea-level rise. PUB has taken on the role of the national Coastal Protection Agency from April 2020. With this new responsibility, one agency, PUB, will study both coastal and inland flooding holistically and develop models to guide our flood protection response.To facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy, we are continuing our investment in low-emissions solutions and are partnering the industry and our research community to explore pilot projects to evaluate and improve the feasibility of technologies to drive the decarbonisation of our electricity grid and industrial processes. The Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) and EMA have launched energy efficiency incentives and schemes to help our companies to be best-in-class globally in energy and carbon efficiency, and are bringing companies within a sector together to achieve systems-level efficiency gains across the sector. We urge companies to use this period of lowered activities to consider implementing energy efficiency improvement projects where possible, so that companies can be more cost-competitive and emerge stronger when the economy picks up again.As we work to prepare Singapore to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, members of this house can be assured that the Government will keep climate change high as a priority. We will work assiduously to build a more resilient Singapore to withstand the test of future challenges, notably climate change. We encourage all Singaporeans to join us and play their part to ""game change"" climate change."
possible review of “30 by 30 vision” to produce 30% of singapore's food needs locally by 2030,"Mr Seah Kian Peng asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether there are plans to review the ""30 by 30 vision"" to locally produce 30% of Singapore's nutritional needs by 2030.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: When we started working on our ""30 by 30"" goal in 2018, our primary intention was to adapt to the challenges posed by climate change and resource scarcity. Last year, my Ministry announced our ""30 by 30"" goal, to produce 30 per cent of our nutritional needs locally by 2030. It complements our other strategies of diversifying import sources, growing overseas and stockpiling, to ensure the resilience of Singapore's food supply. This goal is ambitious, considering that we currently produce less than 10 per cent of our requirements, and we must achieve this goal with less than one per cent of our land.  In February this year, my Ministry launched the 2020: Singapore Food Story, a year-long campaign to raise awareness on Singapore's food security. As events would have it, the COVID-19 outbreak escalated quickly, impacting countries, big and small, all over the world. This pandemic has disrupted global supply chains and affected global trade and commerce. COVID-19 has strongly reinforced the need for Singapore to secure our food supply and the importance, timeliness and relevance of our ""30 by 30"" goal. For now, we are not planning to review the ""30 by 30"" goal, which is already an ambitious undertaking. Local food production forms one part of our basket of strategies to buffer against food supply shocks. We are mindful that local production will not allow us to be self-sufficient in all varieties of food types that we are importing from more than 170 countries and regions today. However, we are responding to the COVID-19 pandemic by accelerating our ramp up in local food production. In April, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) launched a ""30 by 30 Express"" grant call to ramp up local production in eggs, leafy vegetables and fish over the next six to 24 months. Through this call, SFA will crowdsource and support innovative proposals to grow food productively and sustainably. I am also chairing a multi-agency ministerial taskforce to guide agencies in this effort, including addressing any hurdles related to the setting up or expansion of farms.Even as we ramp up local food production, we need the support of all consumers, corporations and supermarkets to support local produce. Local produce is grown close to our homes, and is therefore fresher, lasts longer and is more sustainable as it incurs lower carbon miles. We encourage Singaporeans to eat local, so as to spur our farmers to increase their production, and in turn reap the benefits of economies of scale and generate exciting jobs for our people. To make it easier for everyone to identify and support local produce, SFA is working with our farmers and retailers to include a new local produce logo, to be incorporated into their packaging which will be rolled out soon. The new label is a result of SFA's consultation with industry stakeholders and members of the public. SFA will also continue to collaborate with retailers like NTUC FairPrice, Cold Storage and Prime Supermarket to organise joint promotions and display in-store branding collaterals with key messages to promote awareness of local produce. As part of Singapore Together, we will be convening a Citizens' Workgroup this year to co-create ideas to increase demand for local produce. "
enhancements to neu pc plus programme,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Communications and Information with reference to the NEU-PC Plus Programme (a) before COVID-19, what was the rationale for the limit of one digital device per low-income household notwithstanding the number of children; (b) whether the Ministry will retain the COVID-19 enhancements to the Programme permanently; (c) whether the Ministry will enhance the Programme to (i) give every low-income household student a digital device and (ii) provide digital devices to low-income household students in pre-school or university; and (d) whether the Ministry will allow students on the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme to automatically benefit from the Programme without having to submit a separate application.","Mr S Iswaran: Our approach to digital inclusion strikes a balance between providing help and using public funds prudently, in a manner that is fit for purpose. Hence the Infocomm Media Development Authority's (IMDA) Home Access and NEU PC Plus focus on enabling access to digital devices and connectivity. This is done by providing one device to a qualifying household, which can be shared among household members, rather than providing one device to every individual in the household. This approach applies to students as well. IMDA's NEU PC Plus scheme complements MOE's existing provisions through the schools for students to access computing services.However, the Government is also prepared to be flexible, especially when needs change. The COVID-19 pandemic and the adoption of system-wide Full Home-Based Learning for the Circuit Breaker period translated into a greater need for digital devices among families with school-going children. MOE and IMDA's support schemes have therefore been modified and enhanced to broaden the criteria and to speed up delivery. For instance, students were given the option of borrowing devices through their schools. IMDA also began subsidising a second computer for large families with three or more children.In addition, to extend more help to needy households, IMDA adjusted the criteria for the iNSPIRE fund, which helps families with the co-payment component, to include all students under MOE's FAS Programme. IMDA and MOE have also streamlined and expedited the NEU PC Plus application process for students on MOE's Financial Assistance Scheme. The enhancements have helped many students and families. Since the start of the circuit breaker, school have loaned out more than 20,000 computing devices and 1,600 Internet-enabling devices to students. IMDA has also supported around 3,000 households with subsidised computers or Internet connectivity, more than five times the demand during this same period last year. As a result, the majority of students have been able to participate in full Home-Based Learning, with participation averaging 96% across the levels.Even with these measures, we recognise that some families have faced challenges in participating in Home-Based Learning during this period, due to either digital access constraints or other difficult circumstances. Looking ahead, MCI and IMDA are considering maintaining some of the enhancements to the schemes we introduced during the Circuit Breaker period. As we enter Phase One and look ahead to Phase Two of reopening, MCI and MOE are working together to review students' experience with digital access. We stand ready to help plug any gaps identified by the schools, which have not been addressed by existing measures. "
"structure of rental contracts for taxis, private hire cars and limousines","Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the Ministry has studied the structure of rental contracts for taxis, private-hire cars and limousines, in particular (i) the duration of such contracts (ii) rental fees charged and (iii) penalties for early termination; (b) whether rental contracts expose hirers to excessive business risk in the event of sustained reductions in demand such as that from the COVID-19 situation; and (c) whether the industry can be restructured to ensure hirers have more flexible rental arrangements and risk is distributed more equitably.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: There is a wide range of rental contracts among more than a thousand fleet owners in the point-to-point passenger transport (P2P) rental market. This provides drivers with a range of choices, with varying durations, rates and conditions that they can choose from based on their needs. Some prefer short-term contracts with higher rental rates so that they can exit the market quickly, others prefer longer-term contracts to enjoy lower rental rates and loyalty bonuses, but which come with penalties for early termination. Some drivers are employed by P2P operators.The current situation caused by COVID-19 is unprecedented. Drivers face a sudden and significant reduction in their takings, and those who have committed to the P2P industry for the long term will be especially concerned about their livelihoods. That is why the Government has introduced the Special Relief Fund (SRF) and the Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme (SIRS). Under the SRF, active drivers will receive the Government's contribution of $300 per month per vehicle for 7.5 months, on top of the additional contributions from taxi and PHC operators. Under the SIRS, eligible drivers will receive payouts of $1,000 per month for a period of 9 months. The financial status of taxi operators and car rental companies have also been severely affected by the pandemic. Despite these challenges, the companies have initiated significant rental reductions to help defray drivers' costs and sustain their livelihoods. They have also exercised flexibility in addressing rental arrears or the premature return of vehicles.Even as we address the immediate challenges, it is important that we continue to take a long-term view that allows the rental market for P2P vehicles to remain competitive and responsive to drivers' needs. "
impact of telecommuting by employees at water plants on singapore's water supply adequacy,Mr Seah Kian Peng asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether he can assure Singaporeans that our water supply is adequate and that the water plants are continuing to run at full capacity; and (b) what is the percentage of staff at these water plants who are on telecommuting and whether this compromises the quality of our water supply.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Singapore enjoys a diversified and robust supply of water, due to years of continued planning and investments in our water infrastructure. Water from local catchment and imported water, together with weather-resilient sources namely NEWater and desalinated water, make up Singapore's ""Four National Taps"".Under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020, the supply of water was amongst the essential services allowed to operate during the Circuit Breaker period. Since early February 2020, Public Utilities Board (PUB) has activated business continuity plans to ensure that all our water plants continue to operate as per normal.   PUB has implemented Safe Management Measures in accordance to the Ministry of Manpower's guidelines at the plants and work sites. These include regular temperature screenings, physical spacing of at least one metre between persons at all times and wearing of masks. PUB has also stepped up the cleaning of work sites to ensure that equipment shared between different employees across different shifts or teams are cleaned and disinfected at the end of each shift. In addition, PUB has staggered working and lunch hours, and implemented split team arrangements to reduce congregation of our employees.  As part of its comprehensive water sampling and monitoring programme, PUB has also continued to collect and test water samples from our reservoirs, waterworks distribution systems to customers' taps daily. The quality of our drinking water continues to comply with the Environmental Public Health (Water Suitable for Drinking) Regulations 2019 and are well within the World Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality.Singaporeans can be assured that they will continue to enjoy good quality drinking water from the tap during this period. I thank PUB officers for their continued dedication especially during the Circuit Breaker period.  "
safeguarding of personal data collected by contact-tracing apps,Mr Murali Pillai asked the Prime Minister what steps has the Government taken to ensure that personal data of persons collated through apps such as TraceTogether for the purposes of contact tracing to contain the spread of COVID-19 will be protected and not used for any other purpose.,"Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): The close contacts data gathered by TraceTogether will be stored only on the user’s phone in the first instance, and accessed by MOH only if the individual tests positive for COVID-19. It will only be used for contact tracing. Safeguards, including encryption, are in place on the user’s phone to protect this data from malicious hackers. Data older than 25 days will be automatically deleted from the phone. If the close contact data on the person’s phone is required for contact tracing, only a small group of authorised individuals in MOH would be able to see the patient’s personal data. All public sector data protection rules will also apply to the data transferred from the user’s phone to MOH, including abiding by the recommendations of the Public Sector Data Security Review Committee."
impact of safe distancing measures on demand for public transport,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Transport (a) how have COVID-19 social distancing measures affected demand for public transport services; (b) what has been the financial impact on (i) public bus operators (ii) rail operators and (iii) LTA; and (c) what are the plans for public transport financing for the bus and rail systems respectively should COVID-19 measures continue to affect demand in the near and medium term.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, ridership on public buses and trains have fallen significantly, particularly after the circuit breaker measures were imposed. Compared to pre-COVID levels, current ridership has dropped by 75% for buses and 84% for trains. Fare revenues have correspondingly decreased, by about 80% compared to the pre-COVID levels. Operating costs could have come down if supply was adjusted to match falling demand, but operators have largely preserved service capacity and headways to ensure that commuters can maintain safe distancing. In fact, public transport operators are incurring additional costs, as they step up cleaning regime of buses, trains and public transport premises, protect their staff with masks and face shields, pay for the accommodation costs of their Malaysian bus captains affected by the Malaysian Movement Control Order, and deploy transport ambassadors and enforcement officers to ensure safe distancing among commuters. These costs would eventually have to be borne by operators and taxpayers, as they are not adequately covered by current fares. Our transport operators are therefore under significant financial stress, especially as their rail operations were already making losses prior to COVID-19. For now, the impact on public transport operators is partly cushioned from the broad-based Government relief measures such as the Job Support Scheme, property tax rebates and waiver of the foreign worker levy. The temporary suspension of Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) also helps to reduce costs for bus operators. I am grateful to our transport operators for taking a national perspective, working closely with the Government and the NTUC to battle the virus together. Though stressed by the financial pain, they press on with the immediate priority of fighting the virus and supporting essential services.Post-pandemic, we will see how public transport evolves. Will demand for public transport services simply return to the pre-pandemic level? Or will Singaporeans decide to adopt working from home, and flexitime as the new norm? Or will more Singaporeans take to cycling as their preferred mode of commuting? It is too early to determine the post-pandemic world and hence premature to assess its long-term impact to public transport financials. Suffice to say that the pandemic will reshape our economy, our way of life and how we move about. If the impact is drastic, we may have to update the current financing model for public transport appropriately. Meanwhile, let’s continue to focus on defeating the virus, protecting our staff and our commuters. We remain fully committed to ensuring that our essential workers can go to their workplaces safely, conveniently and punctually. "
proposal for relief on motor vehicle depreciation costs due to reduced motor vehicle usage,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Transport in view that COVID-19 social distancing measures have greatly restricted motor vehicle use, whether the Minister will consider providing relief for motor vehicle depreciation costs through extending without charge the validity of existing COEs, road tax, and other relevant motor vehicle licences for a period commensurate with the impact of COVID-19 measures on motor vehicle usage.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: To mitigate the impact arising from COVID-19 and the circuit breaker, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) has already made adjustments to land transport services and charges. For instance, LTA has extended the inspection deadline for private car owners originally scheduled to have their cars inspected during this period. LTA has also extended the deadline for vocational drivers to submit their medical examination reports when renewing their vocational licenses. In both cases, the motorists can continue using their vehicles as long as they have valid insurance coverage and road tax. LTA has also ceased Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) at all gantries from 6 April 2020, in view of the reduction in traffic volume during this period.We have received requests to extend the validity period of the Certificate of Entitlement (COE), road tax and other relevant motor vehicle licences. However, private vehicles are still allowed on our roads for essential work or personal activities like getting groceries. The relevant COE, road tax and vehicle licensing costs will therefore continue to apply.The Government has introduced substantial support measures in the Unity, Resilience and Solidarity budgets to help businesses and households cope with the COVID-19 situation. We must remain prudent in how we use our limited fiscal resources as the pandemic may be long-drawn."
training for safe distancing ambassadors and safe distancing measures after covid-19 circuit breaker period,Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what training has been given to the safe distancing ambassadors to prepare them for their role during the circuit breaker period; and (b) what measures have been put in place to ensure their safety and well-being as they perform their roles.,"38 Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources when the circuit breaker period ends (a) whether the safe distancing measures and penalties will continue to be in force and, if so, how; (b) whether additional measures are necessary to ensure a continuous reduction in new COVID-19 cases; and (c) whether safe distancing ambassadors will continue to be deployed and, if so, how will it be ensured that they adequately protect themselves from abuse and violence.Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The introduction and enforcement of Safe Distancing measures (SDMs) is an important strategy in Singapore's national effort to curb the transmission of COVID-19. The Government takes these SDMs seriously as they are crucial to slow the transmission of the virus and to keep all of us safe. We thank the majority of Singaporeans who have followed not just the letter of the law but also the spirit of the measures. For the small minority who refuse to cooperate, they remain at higher risk of contracting the virus and then spreading it to others. We therefore have enforced strictly so that the pain endured and sacrifices made by the majority are not wasted.The Ministry of Environment and Water Resources leads a Taskforce to implement SDMs in key public spaces in HDB estates, such as town centres, wet markets, hawker centres, coffee shops, parks, and public transport nodes. The Taskforce comprises NEA, SFA, HDB, NParks, LTA, SportSG, PA, SPF, MCCY and PSD. Every day, the agencies deploy around 3,000 Safe Distancing Enforcement Officers, SG Clean Ambassadors, and Safe Distancing Ambassadors. The role of an Enforcement Officer or Ambassador is not an easy one. The officers start their shifts from as early as 6am and are constantly on their feet ensuring that members of public and businesses adhere to the SDMs. Enforcement Officers are authorised to take enforcement actions against violations of SDMs. I would like to thank our officers for their tireless efforts and sacrifices to keep us safe. Our Enforcement Officers and Ambassadors have different backgrounds and skillsets. Many are public service officers from around 50 different agencies, who have stepped forward to join the Taskforce's operations, on top of their existing functions and duties which they still have to balance. Others are displaced Singaporeans on temporary employment, such as those recruited from the aviation sector. We also have volunteers who support PA and other Task Force agencies to ensure safe distancing. Training is conducted for all officers to prepare them before deployment. They are briefed on the SDMs and rules of engagement when dealing with members of public. We pay special attention to remind them not to put themselves in harm's way and to train them to handle situations like assisting vulnerable groups such as seniors and individuals with mental illness with sensitivity or managing uncooperative and abusive individuals. During their initial deployment, these officers are paired with more experienced team mates for additional on-the-job guidance to familiarise them with the work and build their confidence.For their safety and protection, Enforcement Officers and Ambassadors are given identification, such as passes and armbands, and protective equipment, which may include face masks, face shields, and hand sanitisers. They are also reminded to practise good hygiene such as to take their temperature twice a day, wash their hands frequently with soap and water, and shower and change their clothes at the end of the day before they come into close contact with others. We have also developed a set of best practices for deploying agencies, such as keeping officers to the same team for daily deployment where possible.While the majority of the population has been cooperative, a small number of individuals have been defiant and abusive to our Enforcement Officers and Ambassadors. They have photographed and filmed them as they do their jobs, and have even verbally and physically abused them. Let me state categorically that this is unacceptable and we have zero tolerance for abuse of our officers. We have and will continue to work closely with the Police to identify, apprehend, and charge those responsible with the full force of the law. SDMs and the associated penalties will be in force for the duration of the Circuit Breaker period, which is until 1 June. We will adjust the measures and deployment of officers depending on the prevailing situation. To minimise the risk of future outbreaks, we must continue to take steps to protect ourselves and others. I urge everyone to continue to follow the prevailing safe distancing advisories and measures, and observe high standards of personal hygiene and social responsibility. In this way, we can better protect ourselves and our loved ones.I also seek your support for our Enforcement Officers and Ambassadors who are working for our collective safety and health. Please cooperate with them. If you see them in your community, give them a wave of encouragement from a distance away, to recognise and support them for their hard work to keep us safe."
singapore’s plans for economy as other countries gradually reopen their economies,"Ms Tin Pei Ling asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) given the other countries' gradual reopening of their economies, what is Singapore's plan for our economy; and (b) how will an extension or repeat of the circuit breaker impact our economy.","Mr Chan Chun Sing: We are acutely aware that the circuit breaker will disrupt businesses and have a substantial impact on our economy, but this painful trade-off was needed to save lives and protect the health of our people, including our migrant worker community.As we bring down the number of new COVID-19 cases, we will progressively restart our economy. This will not be straightforward. We have kept essential services going. But the rest of the economy will have to open up step by step, and not all at once. We will open up some sectors earlier, but others will have to wait, especially those that attract crowds such as entertainment outlets or sporting events. In phasing in the opening of firms and sectors, we will take into account their importance to the economy and supply chains, contribution to local employment, and ability to minimise risks of transmission at their worksites. Sectors that allow us to trade with the world and access critical supplies must restart first. Sectors that attract high traffic and social interactions will have to put in additional safe measures before restarting progressively.To ensure that the health of Singaporeans and our workers continues to take priority even as we resume economic activities, we are ramping up testing capabilities and leveraging technology to conduct robust contact tracing and rapid isolation of close contacts, to ringfence infected cases quickly and prevent the growth of clusters. We will also raise the minimum standards for the safeguards needed to keep our workplaces safe. This will apply to all companies that are currently operating, as well as those who are allowed to reopen subsequently.Companies will need to deploy SafeEntry, to facilitate better contact tracing. Companies must also continue to implement and strengthen safe management practices. These include telecommuting wherever possible, enforcing safe distancing and mask wearing amongst their employees at the workplace, staggering working hours and break times, ensuring no cross-deployment of staff across teams or worksites, and reducing physical interaction or mixing amongst workers, including outside of work. Further details will be announced by the relevant agencies in due course. We will also work closely with the Trade Associations and Chambers over the next few weeks to reach out to businesses, including small and medium-sized enterprises, to help them prepare to meet the stronger safe management requirements when they reopen.In the longer term, COVID-19 will result in many structural changes to the global economy. The movement of goods and people will be more restricted. Countries will worry more about depending on others or relying on a single source of supply for essential goods like drugs, medical equipment or food. This will have major implications for global trade and investments, and for a small and open economy like Singapore.This will mean that we must be prepared for significant structural changes to our economy. Companies will have to change their business models to survive, and workers from disrupted industries will have to reskill themselves to take up jobs in new sectors. But there will be new opportunities as well, in areas such as medical services, biotechnology, online education, food production and delivery. While we already have capabilities in some of these sectors, we will have to build up our capabilities and workforce in some of the newer industries.Adapting to the post-COVID-19 world will be a serious challenge, but I am confident that Singapore will be able to succeed. We have restructured our economy before, and emerged stronger each time. If the government, employers and workers continue working together, we will also be able to overcome this challenge."
extension of rental waivers to sub-tenants and licensees at government-owned properties,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance whether sub-tenants/licensees of Government-owned properties, including coffeeshop stallholders, have any recourse to seek rental waivers provided to tenants as part of the COVID-19 measures but which have not been passed on to the sub-tenants/licensees by the tenants, especially where the sub-tenancy/licence agreements require the regular payment of rent instead of alternative methods of profit sharing or remuneration between the parties.","Mr Heng Swee Keat: Mr Speaker, may I request that Question Number 35 be redirected from the Minister for National Development to me as the Minister for Finance, please. The Government has a total of about 37,700 tenants who will benefit from the rental waivers. We recognise that there may also be sub-tenancies under some of these main or master tenants. This is why the Government requires all master tenants to sign a written undertaking to pass on at least 80% of the rental waiver granted by the Government to eligible sub-tenants, including coffeeshop stallholders. The requirement to pass on at least 80% of the rental waiver took into account that master tenants may have to incur costs for the space, such as maintenance and cleaning. The written undertaking is legally enforceable and agencies can withhold the rental waiver or even take tenancy action as a last resort if the rental waivers are not passed on to the sub-tenants.If Members of this House encounter any sub-tenant who did not receive Government rental waivers passed down from their master tenants, please direct them to notify the landlord agency who will assist to enforce the rental waiver pass-through."
complaints about betting messages sent to mobile phone subscribers,"Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) over the past three years, how many complaints have been made by mobile customers receiving online betting messages; and (b) what can a mobile subscriber do to block out such messages.","Mr S Iswaran: At present, when the Police receives a complaint, they will note the offending phone number and take appropriate actions, such as follow-up investigations. Since May 2018, the Police has been working with the telcos to terminate phone numbers associated with illegal online betting activities. While the Police does not track the global number of complaints for online betting messages specifically, about 1,300 phone numbers have been terminated to date. These were identified through complaints by members of the public or through investigations carried out by the Police.  Mobile subscribers should block online betting messages they receive using the spam filtering functions on their phones or third party applications. In addition, they can report such messages to SPF's I-Witness platform, the Police@sg mobile app or via email. My Ministry and IMDA will also continue to work with MHA and the Police to counter SMSes promoting illicit activities including online betting."
exemption of listed developers with minor foreign shareholders from qualifying certificate scheme,"Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling asked the Minister for Law (a) what is the rationale for exempting listed developers with minor foreign shareholders from the Qualifying Certificate (QC) Scheme; (b) how can this ensure that developers do not acquire land bank plots that are designated for non-landed housing development; and (c) how will the QC Scheme ensure that the objective of proper management of Singapore's land is met while factors like additional buyer's stamp duty (ABSD), shareholder structures in developers' companies and their stock exchange listings evolve over time.","Mr K Shanmugam: The objective of the Residential Property Act, or RPA, is to safeguard residential land for Singaporeans, and prevent foreign housing developers from hoarding or speculating in residential land. Under the Qualifying Certificate regime, or QC regime, which is administered under the RPA, foreign housing developers are required to complete their developments within five years of issuance of the QC and dispose of all residential units within two years of completion. The QC regime is not a market control mechanism.A housing developer that is a Singapore company is not subject to the QC regime. A Singapore company is defined in the RPA as one that is incorporated in Singapore, and all its directors and members are Singapore citizens or Singapore companies. This strict definition meant that housing developers which are essentially Singaporean or have a substantial connection to Singapore were not considered as Singapore companies, if they are publicly listed and their shares are freely traded. This is why we introduced the exemption framework under the QC regime earlier this year. It allows publicly listed housing developers with a substantial connection to Singapore to be treated as Singapore companies within the meaning of the RPA, when they acquire residential land for development. The exemption framework better aligns the QC regime with the objectives of the RPA. Housing developers that wish to obtain exemptions from the QC regime on the basis of a substantial connection to Singapore, are assessed based on strict criteria, including whether they have a Singaporean chairperson and Board majority, a significantly Singaporean substantial shareholding interest, and their track record in Singapore. Exempted developers must continue to meet the exemption criteria to retain their exemptions. They will also be subject to monitoring and other safeguards, including an annual declaration of material information, such as the members of their Board and substantial shareholding interest."
"government's stance on changing one’s sexual orientation through ""conversion therapy""","Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Health with regard to the practice of changing one's sexual orientation through psychological and spiritual means, also known as ""conversion therapy"", whether the Ministry will consider (i) stating an official position against conversion therapy, as it is not approved by expert bodies in psychology including the American Psychiatric Association (APA) and the British Psychological Society (BPS) (ii) disseminating guidelines against conversion therapy to mental healthcare professionals (iii) establishing complaint mechanisms for clients who have experienced conversion therapy and (iv) pursuing disciplinary action for mental healthcare professionals who practise or refer patients to conversion therapy.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th revision (ICD-10), which is the current standardised medical classification list by the World Health Organisation (WHO), states that sexual orientation alone is not to be regarded as a clinical disorder that needs to be cured. Homosexuality has not been considered a psychiatric diagnosis since 1973 (by the American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) and 1977 (by the WHO International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems).MOH expects doctors and other healthcare professionals to practice according to evidence-based best practice and clinical ethics, and to consider and respect patients' preferences and circumstances (including sexual orientation) when providing care. For individuals who seek care with a desire to change one's sexual orientation through clinical means, healthcare professionals should care for and support these individuals with empathy and sensitivity. Mechanisms for the public to feedback on care provided already exist at public healthcare institutions and members of the public can submit a formal complaint to the Singapore Medical Council (SMC) if a doctor is acting unethically or providing inappropriate treatment. The SMC takes complaints against doctors seriously and will investigate and impose disciplinary action if the doctor was found guilty of misconduct."
adequacy of current number of qualified lift technicians to meet requirements in enhanced regulatory framework for lift maintenance industry,"Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the current number of qualified lift technicians; (b) given BCA's introduction of an enhanced regulatory framework for the lift maintenance industry, whether there is enough supply of lift technicians; (c) how does the regulator ensure that all lift technicians obtain the necessary certificate of competency; and (d) what actions will be taken against companies who deploy untrained lift technicians to the worksites to perform lift maintenance.","Mr Lawrence Wong: There are currently about 2,400 lift technicians employed in Singapore. BCA has put in place various measures to attract, develop and retain lift technicians. These include introducing a progressive wage model for the industry in 2019, which sets out structured pathways for progression. BCA is also exploring the use of Remote Monitoring and Diagnostics technology to increase productivity. This will uplift the nature of the job and enable each technician to maintain a larger number of lifts.To ensure a high standard of maintenance as our lift stock continues to grow, BCA will require lift technicians to obtain either a Nitec in Built Environment (Vertical Transport) or a Certificate of Competency (CoC) in Lift Maintenance for Lift Specialist before they are allowed to maintain lifts independently.To date, more than 400 of the 2,400 lift technicians have received either the Nitec or the CoC. BCA will continue to work with ITE to ensure that there is sufficient capacity to train our lift technicians before the requirements come into effect. Once the requirements take effect, it will be an offence for lift maintenance contractors to deploy technicians without the required certification to maintain lifts independently. BCA will conduct audits on lift maintenance operations and take enforcement actions against errant contractors."
inspection of older hdb main doors installed before weather pattern changes to test their adequacy to withstand elements,"Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for National Development considering that many HDB flats were built in the years when rainy weather was less extreme compared to today, whether HDB will (i) do a one-time inspection of the main doors that bore the brunt of heavy rain to ensure safety and (ii) provide goodwill repair of damaged doors.","Mr Lawrence Wong: During a heavy downpour, especially during the monsoon season, some rainwater splashing along the more open areas like lift lobbies and common corridors is inevitable. For weather protection, common corridors are provided with an extended overhang like a canopy. While this is generally adequate to minimise rainwater splashing during normal rainy days, it may not be able to fully prevent the corridor or main doors of flats from getting wet during heavy downpours accompanied by strong winds.  Nonetheless, if HDB receives feedback from residents that the rainwater splashing is severe, HDB will assess the situation and, if necessary, offer to provide a rain screen, subject to SCDF's fire safety requirements being met."
quantum of grants disbursed under seniors mobility fund and re-application for replacement of mobility devices,"Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked the Minister for Health (a) for the past three years, what has been the quantum of grants disbursed under the Seniors Mobility Fund; and (b) whether the Ministry will allow eligible seniors to re-apply for replacement of mobility devices after a number of years as these items are subject to wear and tear.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Seniors' Mobility and Enabling Fund (SMF) supports seniors to age in place, by providing eligible Singaporeans aged 60 years and above means-tested subsidies to offset the cost of assistive devices and home healthcare items. Between 2017 and 2019, the Ministry of Health (MOH) disbursed $89 million in SMF subsidies. SMF subsidies are meant to support seniors with the purchase of their first device. Nonetheless, we recognise that there may be exceptional circumstances, where seniors may need to purchase a replacement device but have no financial means. In such cases, the Agency for Integrated Care will assess and approve applications on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the senior's circumstances."
number of cases of emergencies attributed to food allergies onboard commercial flights from singapore,"Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked the Minister for Transport (a) in the past three years, how many cases of emergencies attributed to food allergies have occurred onboard commercial flights from Singapore; (b) whether local commercial flights are subjected to regulations concerning medical equipment onboard; and (c) whether epinephrine auto-injectors can be mandated for inclusion in emergency medical kits on board flights.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Over the last three years, Singapore carriers have reported a total of 20 incidents of food allergies on board their flights. None required the use of epinephrine or emergency flight diversions.Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) regulations require Singapore carriers to carry first aid and emergency medical kits on their aircraft. Epinephrine auto-injectors are included in the emergency medical kit and cabin crew are trained in the use of the auto-injectors."
financial products to protect special needs children and their families,Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Social and Family Development whether there has been a review of the sufficiency and availability of financial products that can protect special needs children and their families.,"Mr Desmond Lee: There is a range of financial services and schemes available to special needs children and their families.MSF set up the Special Needs Trust Company, or SNTC, about 10 years ago to better support caregivers in planning for financial and care arrangements for their loved ones upon the caregiver's demise. SNTC is a not-for-profit trust company that provides subsidised trust services. The social workers at SNTC work together with the caregivers to develop a care plan and estimate the amount of funds to set aside for the long-term care of their loved ones. The care plan takes into account the care, medical and accommodation preferences of the beneficiaries and their caregivers. Apart from administering the trust services, SNTC also administers the Special Needs Saving Scheme (SNSS) developed by MSF in partnership with the Central Provident Fund Board (CPFB). Under the SNSS, caregivers can nominate their loved ones to receive monthly disbursements from their CPF savings after their demise. Caregivers can also consider other financial instruments such as regular savings plans and insurance products to build a financial safety net for their dependents. One example is the Dependants' Protection Scheme (DPS), a term insurance scheme provided by CPF Board that is automatically extended to eligible CPF members. The DPS benefit will be paid out if the insured caregiver passes away or suffers from terminal illness or total permanent disability. Persons with disabilities can also benefit from the following:(a) CareShield Life – which provides universal coverage to all Singaporean Citizens and Permanent Residents born in or after 1980 from mid-2020, to ensure basic protection of long-term care needs for our future generations, including those with pre-existing disability. Coverage starts from 30 years old, and monthly payouts are provided as long as one is severely disabled.(b) Home Caregiving Grant – which provides a $200 monthly cash payout to offset the caregiving costs of eligible persons who always require some assistance to perform three or more Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). Families can contact the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) if they would like to apply for this grant.(c) Other Government subsidies – which help ensure the affordability of essential services and products utilised by persons with disabilities, which include early intervention, special education, day care, residential care, assistive technology devices and transportation. Low-income families pay minimal or no out-of-pocket fees, with government subsidies to cover their expenses. For those who are unable to afford the out-of-pocket fees, social workers from Social Services Agencies (SSAs) help to look into their financial situation. The SSAs may further subsidise persons with disabilities through donations raised by their organisations. Persons with disabilities can also tap on MediShield Life, a basic health insurance plan that protects all Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents against large hospital bills for life, regardless of age or health conditions.There are many persons with disabilities who are capable of finding work on their own, and living independently. Some may require a little more support to find employment. To this end, MSF set up SG Enable in 2013 to enhance the employability of persons with disabilities and increase employment options for them. SG Enable works closely with SSAs to support persons with disabilities in finding employment, through its job placement and job support services provided by job coaches. This helps to empower and enable them to live more independently.Persons with disabilities and caregivers can refer to the SG Enable website at www.sgenable.sg and the Enabling Guide at www.enablingguide.sg for more information on such schemes and services.  "
encouraging companies to provide family care leave and other support to help employees cope with work and care-giving responsibilities,Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for Manpower how can the Government and tripartite partners encourage employers to provide support to employees with caregiving responsibilities such as family care leave to help them cope with work and caregiving responsibilities.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: The Government and tripartite partners are committed to provide working caregivers with the necessary support so that they can fulfil both their work and caregiving responsibilities. To better understand the needs of caregivers, MOH led a cross-agency review in 2018. When interviewed, employees who were caregivers provided feedback that Flexible Work Arrangements (FWAs) were more important than other measures such as family care leave in supporting them in their caregiving needs.To help caregivers, MOM has, together with our tripartite partners, adopted a multi-pronged strategy to support and encourage employers to adopt FWAs. First, we provide grants to employers who adopt FWAs. In 2019, MOM increased the Work-Life Grant (WLG) budget to $100 million to support and encourage more companies to provide FWAs to their employees. Second, through the Tripartite Standard (TS) on FWAs, we recognise progressive employers who offer FWAs. As at end-December 2019, close to 2,100 employers responsible for some 470,000 employees, have adopted the TS FWAs. Third, we guide employers on how to implement FWAs. Resources such as the Tripartite Advisory (TA) on FWAs and Job-Sharing Implementation Guide help them make FWAs available to their employees. Fourth, we actively promote FWAs among employers and raise their awareness of how FWAs can improve their staff retention. We reach them through sector-specific engagement sessions, online marketing and roadshows.These efforts are paying off as we are seeing more employers offering FWAs. Based on MOM surveys, more than 9 in 10 employers in 2018 offered some form of formal or ad-hoc FWAs, up from about 8 in 10 in 2013.1 As a result, more employees are benefiting from FWAs. Among those who required FWAs in 2018, more than 8 in 10 could avail themselves to the FWA they needed, which was an increase from 2016, when only 7 in 10 could do so.2  In response to the Citizens' Panel on Work-Life Harmony's recommendations made last year, our tripartite partners will also commit to intensifying their efforts to support adoption of FWAs. More details will be shared at the upcoming Committee of Supply debates."
work-study as integral component of undergraduate degree programmes at autonomous universities,Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for Education (a) how pervasive is work-study an integral component of undergraduate degree programmes offered by our autonomous universities; and (b) what is the current percentage of degree programmes that have compulsory internship as part of the course work.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: The Autonomous Universities (AUs) work closely with industry partners and sector agencies to equip students with industry-relevant skills. As part of this effort, the AUs have included work-study elements in their curriculum which typically involve an industry stint for workplace learning.  This is done in two main ways. The first approach is through internships. Currently, internships are compulsory for around 70% of our degree programmes, and are typically between 6 to 12 weeks long. For programmes where internships are not compulsory, students are encouraged to take up internships.The second approach is through SkillsFuture Work-Study Degrees. One key feature is the joint development and co-delivery of the curriculum by the AUs and employers. This training includes both theory and practice, through a combination of institution-based learning and structured on-the-job training. The work component of the Work-Study Degree is also more significant than internships, typically about 30% of the programme duration. The number of Work-Study Degree programmes has increased from 10 in 2017 to 30 in 2019, spanning a range of disciplines such as Data Science, Engineering and Hospitality Business. As at 2019, around 350 students have enrolled in a Work-Study Degree.   We will continue to work with our AUs to expand work-study opportunities for our students. We target to put 12% of each cohort to undertake work-study programmes by 2030."
complaints of excessive number of foreigners working in financial institutions,Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for Manpower how many complaints have been received in the last three years regarding excessive foreigners working in financial institutions.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: Over the last three years, MOM and TAFEP received 65 complaints or feedback regarding the hiring of foreigners in financial institutions. In most cases, the complainants did not provide specific information for follow up action. Of those that did, MOM and TAFEP investigated thoroughly and took appropriate actions, including withholding of work pass privileges.Locals hold more than four out of five jobs paying $3,600 or more (the minimum qualifying salary for Employment Pass) in the financial sector. This ratio has held steady over the last three years, even as the workforce in the sector grew. While most financial institutions and hiring managers understand the need to hire based on merit, there is a minority of employers that seek to circumvent our fair hiring requirements. MOM does not tolerate any form of workplace discrimination, and has recently raised penalties across the board for all forms of discrimination. Beyond the employers, MOM will also take individual employees to task if they were involved in any unfair hiring practices. Beyond complaints, MOM has enhanced our detection of unfair hiring behaviour through data analytics. We urge members of the public to report to MOM or TAFEP if they come across workplace discrimination, and provide specific information so that we can take action. The identity of whistleblowers will be kept confidential."
review of sexual education in schools with greater emphasis on gender equality,Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Education (a) whether there are any plans to review sexual education in schools beyond sexual protection and abuse towards building sensitivities and consciousness by focusing on gender equality; and (b) how often are sexual education programmes reviewed and what is the process of doing so.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: Sexuality Education in our schools focuses on imparting knowledge and social and emotional skills for positive self-development and self-identity, and developing healthy and rewarding relationships. Besides important topics on safety and protection from abuse and sexual health, students also learn how to deal with physical, social and emotional changes that they are going through. They will also learn about gender roles and stereotypes, and that one's roles, interests and career pursuits are not defined by gender stereotypes. They learn the value of appreciating one's unique qualities and to respect and show empathy and care for one another. MOE reviews sexuality education regularly. We take into consideration local and international research, inputs from stakeholders including specialists in their field, parents and students and our local context. For example, new scenarios and discussions had recently been included, covering areas like pornography and the influence of social media on self-perception and esteem, and relationships.  "
cause of recent mass fish deaths at pasir ris,Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for National Development with regard to the recent case of hundreds of dead fish at Pasir Ris beach (a) whether the Ministry has determined the cause of the mass fish deaths; (b) whether there are any health concerns which may affect residents in the area; and (c) whether there is a need to control the plankton bloom which may be the cause of the incident.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: NParks has worked with NEA and SFA to look into the cause of the recent fish deaths at Pasir Ris Beach. NParks has found that the affected fish were of mainly one species of wild fish found in our coastal waters. The incident appears to be an isolated one. Thus far, NParks has not observed any other dead fish or animals along the surrounding coastal areas at Changi Beach, East Coast Park, and Pulau Ubin. NEA's and SFA's coastal water quality monitoring sensors did not pick up any anomalies over this period. The coastal water quality during the week of 27 January and 3 February 2020 met the World Health Organisation’s recreational water guidelines, and Pasir Ris Beach remains safe for recreational water activities. The plankton count was normal. There were also no abnormal fish deaths reported at the nearby floating fish farms.Agencies will continue to look into the cause of the fish deaths. We will also continue to closely monitor the coastal beaches near the Pasir Ris area, including the water quality, for any anomalies."
number of families and couples renting under parenthood provisional housing scheme and those in arrears,Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the number of families and couples who are renting under the Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme currently; and (b) what is the number and percentage of this group who are in arrears.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: There are about 630 households currently renting under the Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme, or PPHS, as at end January 2020. Among these households, about 7% of them are in arrears.For PPHS households in arrears, HDB will work with them on an instalment plan to repay their arrears, or to move to a flat with lower rent, according to their budget. Those in financial hardship can also be referred to MSF's Social Service Office for financial assistance. "
balancing needs of motorists and pedestrians with increasing number of silver zones built,"Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Transport with the increasing number of Silver Zones to be built, how will the Ministry strike a balance between the needs of motorists and pedestrians at these Silver Zones.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Silver Zones were launched in 2014 to improve safety for seniors. They include features such as (i) longer green man timings; (ii) two-stage crossings for seniors; (iii) reduced speed limit of 40 km/h; (iv) speed bumps and bus-friendly humps; and (iv) narrowing of lanes with a centre divider. These features would inconvenience the motorists, but are necessary to enhance safety for senior pedestrians. Since the implementation of Silver Zones, there has been a 75% drop in road accidents involving senior pedestrians within these zones. Silver Zones are implemented in places with a high proportion of senior residents, and where there have been past accidents involving seniors. LTA consults the local community and considers the needs of all stakeholders, including motorists and seniors in deciding on the location and design of the Silver Zones. "
demolition of kallang squash centre and impact on availability of venue for hosting international squash tournaments and training for elite players,"Mr Ong Teng Koon asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth with the demolition of the Kallang Squash Centre (a) whether Singapore will have a venue capable of hosting international squash tournaments and elite level training for squash players; (b) what are the plans to provide an alternative venue; (c) whether there are plans to include squash facilities for the Kallang Alive project; (d) whether squash has the potential to be an important contributor to Singapore's sporting success at international tournaments; and (e) whether there is a decline in the number of public squash facilities since the 1990s and, if so, whether there are plans to reverse this decline.","Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: Sport Singapore (SportSG) currently manages 24 squash courts across five locations – Burghley, Kallang, MOE (Evans), St Wilfrid and Yio Chu Kang – which have been open to the public since the 1980s. The average utilisation rate for these courts during peak periods has remained stable at around 70% over the past three years. But it has been uneven, with the 10 courts at the Burghley and Evans Road sites seeing peak demand at less than 60% of its capacity.  SportSG has been engaging the Singapore Squash Rackets Association (SSRA) on the replacement facilities for the Kallang Squash Centre since 2018. In the meantime, SportSG has identified Burghley and Yio Chu Kang as potential locations for the interim National Training Centre for our elite athletes, and will continue to work with the SSRA on the interim and longer-term infrastructure plans for the sport.   The squash fraternity has done well and Singaporeans can be proud of their sporting achievements. In the recently concluded Southeast Asian Games held in the Philippines, Singapore's squash team won two silver and three bronze medals. Squash's continued success will require the fraternity and its supporters to work together for its longer-term development. SportSG will be happy to partner the SSRA on its goals for the sport, and work with the squash fraternity and the community to support these goals.                    "
imposing legal obligations on food delivery companies to ensure their drivers comply with active mobility and road traffic regulations,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Transport whether the Government will consider imposing legal obligations on food delivery companies to ensure that their delivery riders on e-bikes or e-scooters comply with active mobility or road traffic regulations including compliance with device requirements or proper usage.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The Active Mobility (Amendment) and the Shared Mobility Enterprises (Control and Licensing) Bills which this House debated and passed on 4 February 2020 will include regulations that will apply to businesses such as food delivery companies, which engage active mobility users in the course of work. The companies should be responsible for ensuring that their riders ride safely. We will introduce a legal obligation on these companies to ensure that all active mobility users they engage in the course of work have third-party liability insurance. This includes users of bicycles, personal mobility devices, power assisted bicycles, and personal mobility aids.  Apart from businesses, retailers and users of active mobility devices also play a part in ensuring that the devices used on public paths are compliant and used safely. "
priority for bto flats in mature estates for first-time applicants whose parents or in-laws live in the estate,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry can review the existing policy so as to accord priority to first-time applicants for BTO flats in mature estates where their parents or parents-in-law are living in.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Families who wish to buy a new HDB flat to live with or near their parents already enjoy priority in their flat application under the Married Child Priority Scheme and the Multi-Generation Priority Scheme. This includes those who wish to buy flats in the mature estates. Families may also wish to consider buying a resale flat to live with or near their parents. They can enjoy a Proximity Housing Grant of up to $30,000. In total, first-timer families can enjoy up to $160,000 in grants for their resale flat purchase. All resale grants are available for flat purchases in both the mature and non-mature estates. "
measures to counter new tactics in actual and attempted piracy and robbery cases in singapore strait and surrounding waters,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Defence (a) what new tactics have been designed by those responsible for the rise in actual and attempted piracy and robbery cases in the Singapore Strait and its surrounding waters; (b) what measures can be deployed to deter and eliminate such threats; and (c) how will the revised Standard Operating Procedures signed at the 14th Malacca Straits Patrol Joint Coordinating Committee Meeting address the rise in the number of piracy and robbery cases in the straits of Malacca and Singapore.,"Dr Ng Eng Hen: The number of piracy and sea robbery incidents occuring in the Singapore Strait fluctuates considerably from year to year. For example, in years, 2014, 2015 and 2019, there were 48, 104 and 31 such incidents. But in the remaining years over the last decade, the average was around 12. It is therefore difficult to conclude if there will be a persistent increase from the 2019 figures alone, although our maritime agencies are monitoring this closely. What we have determined is that the tactics and modus operandi of the perpetrators remain the same, consisting of petty crime involving the theft of crew belongings, engine parts, or scrap metal. All perpetrators are based and operate outside Singapore's territorial waters, and therefore we are working with our neighbours to share information and collect intelligence, so that Singapore can be better prepared to meet such threats. Against specific incidents, our national maritime agencies can only act in our territorial waters, which we did in two of these incidents, where the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) and Police Coast Guard (PCG) boarded these ships to rule out any residual security risks, prior to their entry into Singapore's ports. For incidents outside our waters, Singapore has longstanding cooperation with navies and coast guards of Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand to deal with transnational maritime piracy, robbery and other security threats. Most recently, at the 14th Malacca Straits Patrol (MSP) Joint Coordination Committee meeting, the navies of Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand revised the MSP Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to enhance the region's ability to tackle sea robbery in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore. This included a commitment to quarterly exercises to sharpen information exchange processes, as well as an updated set of suspicious contact indicators to assist investigation efforts of sea robbery incidents. Beyond regular conduct of sea and air patrols under the MSP, joint training and exercises as well as information sharing strengthen understanding and collaboration to deal with maritime incidents together.  The RSN's Information Fusion Centre (IFC) shares information with our neighbours on a regular basis to aid them in deterring possible perpetrators and successfully responding to sea robbery attempts. For instance, on 18 January this year, the IFC was alerted of a sea robbery incident involving a tugboat towing a barge. The information was shared via the IFC with the Indonesian authorities as the incident had occurred in their waters, which led to the successful arrest of the criminals involved. On a day-to-day basis, the RSN also works alongside other local maritime agencies such as the PCG and Maritime and Port Authority (MPA) through the Singapore Maritime Crisis Centre (SMCC). The SMCC is a whole-of-Government set-up that maintains our maritime situation picture, drives sense-making efforts, and coordinates responses to potential maritime security threats.Nevertheless, we agree with Members that additional measures are useful to prevent the further rise in incidence of sea robbery and piracy. We want to step up deeper sharing in information and intelligence with maritime and enforcement agencies within Malaysia and Indonesia. The Maritime Security Task Force (MSTF) is also making plans to restructure itself, including beefing up its assets to deal with such incidents at sea. That review is expected to be complete in the next few months.                     "
"effect of slowdown in china's economic growth on singapore's economy, job situation and investments",Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Trade and Industry in view of China's economic growth at its lowest in 30 years (a) what is the near-term impact on Singapore's economy and jobs situation; (b) how will it alter Singapore's investment in China and Singapore's participation in the Belt and Road Initiative; and (c) what are the future measures to diversify our economic exposure.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: The Chinese economy grew by 6.1% last year. Even though this is its lowest rate of growth in the past 30 years, it is still higher than the average growth rate of 1.7% among advanced economies, and 5.6% among emerging and developing economies in Asia.1 China's slowing rate of growth is not surprising as its economy matures, and shifts towards a more sustainable, consumption-led model of growth. Looking ahead, China's GDP growth is projected to moderate slightly to 6.0% in 20202, although there remain downside risks such as the potential economic impact of the novel coronavirus.  China's slower growth is not expected to have a large impact on the Singapore economy. While China is our largest trading partner and top destination for our outbound investments, it does not account for a disproportionately large share of our well diversified economy. For instance, China accounts for 13.4% of our total trade, compared to other major trading partners like Malaysia (11.1%) and the US (10.3%). We will continue to ensure that our economic relations with foreign partners are balanced and diversified, and that we are not over-exposed to any one foreign country.We will continue to strengthen our economic relations with China, as well as our other trading partners. Bilaterally, we have been working closely with China to deepen our economic linkages. For example, the China-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (CSFTA) Upgrade Protocol that entered into force on 16 October 2019 keeps the agreement up to date by improving trading rules and investment regimes for our companies.3 We are also cooperating with China on international initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Singapore is an early supporter of the BRI. This year marks the 5th anniversary of the China-Singapore (Chongqing) Connectivity Initiative, which is a priority demonstration project under the BRI that brings Southeast Asia and China closer together. In addition, Singapore can also leverage our position as a trusted financial hub, to enhance the sustainability of BRI projects by intermediating financial needs in Asia to tap on opportunities in third country markets.  Even as we continue to deepen our engagement with China, as a small and open economy, we must remain open and connected to the rest of the world. We currently have an extensive network of 25 Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with 64 trading partners which collectively account for more than 85% of global GDP and more than 90% of Singapore's trade. We will continue to expand and diversify our trade linkages through new FTAs with economies such as the Eurasian Economic Union, the Pacific Alliance, and the Southern Common Market in South America (Mercosur). We will also pursue new forms of partnership to facilitate digital economy activities and digital trade. We have recently concluded negotiations on our first Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA) with New Zealand and Chile, and have also embarked on bilateral DEA negotiations with Australia. To help Singapore companies venture into overseas markets and take advantage of these FTAs, we will continue to support companies in going overseas and conquering new markets. We will enhance our support for companies and grow our network of overseas centres to provide Singapore companies assistance in business advisory services, business matching and market set-up overseas.

"action against singaporeans involved in dumping toxic, plastics or other wastes in neighbouring countries","Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources what action can be taken against Singaporeans involved in dumping toxic, plastics or other wastes in neighbouring countries.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The transboundary movement of hazardous and other controlled waste is governed by the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal, or the Basel Convention, which Singapore is a Party to. The Basel Convention does not prohibit the export of hazardous waste, but requires the Prior Informed Consent of the countries of import and transit. This is in recognition of the legitimate transboundary movement of waste as defined under the Convention, such as those for proper recycling or disposal. The Hazardous Waste (Control of Export, Import and Transit) Act, or the HWA, provides the domestic legislative framework for Singapore to meet our obligations under the Basel Convention. The HWA requires companies to obtain a Basel export permit for the export of controlled waste, and empowers the National Environment Agency (NEA) to take regulatory action against companies and individuals who illegally export such waste. Companies convicted under the HWA may be fined up to $300,000, while individuals may be fined up to $100,000, or imprisoned for a term not exceeding two years, or both.Singapore is committed to uphold our obligations under the Basel Convention. NEA has been actively engaging our local companies to increase awareness on Singapore’s obligations under the Basel Convention, and works closely with the relevant authorities of the importing countries to investigate any allegations of illegal export of waste by our companies. Beyond the Basel Convention, we also remind our companies to adhere to the domestic legislation of countries that they are exporting to. The Basel Convention, which currently does not cover the transboundary movement of plastic waste, will be expanded in scope to cover certain categories of plastic waste from January 2021. We are amending the HWA in line with these recent amendments to the Basel Convention. I will share more details on this at the Second Reading of the Hazardous Waste (Control of Export, Import and Transit) Amendment Bill scheduled for this sitting.We take a serious view of any illegal transboundary movement of hazardous and other wastes as defined under the Basel Convention, and will not hesitate to investigate and enforce against violations. At the same time, we recognise that the legitimate flow of clean and valuable recyclables can help support the adoption of a circular economy at the regional and global level. We will continue to work closely with the international community to strike a balance between facilitating the legitimate flow of such resources, and safeguarding against the illegal export of waste.                 "
investigations into piracy incidents in singapore strait in and after december 2019,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether any investigation has been carried out in respect of the piracy incidents in the Singapore Strait in and after December 2019; (b) whether the Government has identified the persons or groups responsible for the reported incidents and where they originate from; (c) what action has been taken by any of our government agencies to date; and (d) what are the Government's plans to prevent similar acts of piracy.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: In December 2019 and January 2020, there were 12 incidents involving piracy and armed robbery against ships in the Singapore Strait. As none of these incidents occurred within Singapore territorial waters, no investigations were required of our agency. If an incident happens within Singapore territorial waters, the Singapore Police Coast Guard (PCG) will investigate where necessary. The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) works with the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) and the PCG to closely monitor vessels around and within Singapore territorial waters. Should any suspicious vessel enter Singapore territorial waters, our maritime agencies will respond robustly to safeguard Singapore's security. MPA regularly broadcasts alerts to vessels to be vigilant when travelling along the Singapore Strait, and issues shipping circulars to advise them on measures to prevent and counter piracy and armed robbery. Such measures include surveillance and detection systems, access control measures, and radio and alarm procedures in the event of an attack. As the Singapore Strait does not only include Singapore territorial waters, the fight against piracy and armed robbery requires strong collaboration among all regional partners. The RSN conducts joint coordinated patrols with Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand through the Malacca Straits Patrol (MSP), to ensure the safety and security of the Strait of Singapore as well as the Strait of Malacca. The MSP holds regular meetings to enhance coordination, review the conduct of operations, and share intelligence and information. Singapore is also part of a region-wide initiative, the Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia, or ReCAAP, which serves to be the information hub in Asia. We encourage the shipping community to provide timely and accurate reporting of incidents to ReCAAP focal points and the nearest coastal state or authority, so that remedial actions can be taken promptly by the respective littoral States. "
ensuring third party contractors in government projects adopt high cybersecurity standards,"Mr Desmond Choo asked the Prime Minister in light of the recent personal data breach involving the Ministry of Defence, how is the Ministry working with Government agencies to ensure that their third party contractors adopt high standards of cybersecurity and that cybersecurity competency is an essential criterion for awarding of Government contracts.","Mr Lee Hsien Loong: Third party contractors of Government agencies handling personal data are required to implement cybersecurity and data protection measures. Penalties may be imposed where there are contractual breaches or acts contravening the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA). The Government has accepted the recommendations of the Public Sector Data Security Review Committee (PSDSRC). These include measures to strengthen the management of third party contractors that handle data on behalf of the Government, such as incorporating data security and governance requirements into the contract with the third party, and regular audits to ensure compliance. These could have helped to prevent or mitigate similar data incidents. The high standards of data protection that the Government places on itself must also extend to these third parties. Investigations regarding the recent personal data incidents involving third-party vendors contracted by MINDEF are still underway. GovTech will work with MINDEF to identify any gaps and address them across the public service and its third party vendors. "
noise barriers along kranji expressway adjacent to residential units along segar estate and blossom residences,Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the Ministry will consider installing noise barriers along the stretch of Kranji Expressway (KJE) running adjacent to the residential units along Segar Estate and Blossom Residences; and (b) what is the estimated cost of installing such noise barriers on a per metre basis.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: To reduce traffic noise along this stretch of the Kranji Expressway (KJE), the Land Transport Authority will implement a low-noise pavement mix for the at-grade section by 1Q2022. Trials have shown that this low-noise pavement mix, is more effective in reducing noise for residents than vertical noise barriers. Noise barriers which cost about $4,000 to $5,000 per metre, are not suitable for this stretch as it will hinder the visibility of on-coming traffic. LTA will continue to explore new and cost effective ways to mitigate the impact of traffic noise and improve the quality of living for residents living near expressways. "
annual number of singaporeans travelling overseas and number of tourist arrivals into singapore,Mr Seah Kian Peng asked the Minister for Trade and Industry in the last three years (a) what is the annual number of Singaporeans travelling overseas and whether the trend is likely to increase; (b) what is the average number of days spent overseas by Singaporeans; and (c) what is the annual number of tourist arrivals to Singapore and what is their average stay.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: In 2019, Singaporeans made about 24.9 million overseas trips. Over the last five years, the number of overseas trips has shown a gradual increase of about 0.2% per annum. We do not have data on the average number of days Singaporeans spent overseas. Over the last five years, tourist arrivals grew at an average rate of almost 5% per annum, to more than 19 million tourists in 2019. Their average length of stay is 3.4 nights. "
asean's support to myanmar in resolving situation in rakhine state,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs (a) whether he can provide an update on the Rohingya crisis as discussed at the recent ASEAN and UN meetings; and (b) whether ASEAN (i) intends to support Myanmar in implementing the recommendations of the Rakhine Advisory Commission and, if yes, what is the target timeline (ii) is confident that there will be continued support of Bangladesh and necessary funding for the refugees at Cox's Bazar whilst repatriation options are being negotiated and (iii) has considered and agreed on a ""Plan B"" for the Rohingya people should the repatriation negotiations not work out.","Dr Vivian Balakrishnan: The situation in Rakhine State is a complex inter-communal issue with deep historical roots. It remains a common concern to all ASEAN Member States. ASEAN has actively engaged the Myanmar Government on the situation, and has extended humanitarian support to the affected communities, through the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on disaster management, or AHA Centre. At the 35th ASEAN Summit in Bangkok in November last year, ASEAN Leaders agreed to establish an Ad-Hoc Support Team of the ASEAN Secretariat to focus on implementing the recommendations of the preliminary needs assessment. You may recall that ASEAN despatched an Emergency Response and Assessment Team (ERAT) to Rakhine State in March 2019 to conduct this preliminary needs assessment. Following the ERAT's visit in March 2019, it tabled a report identifying possible areas where ASEAN could lend its assistance to the Myanmar Government, to aid in the repatriation process.  Recommendations from the preliminary needs assessment were further distilled into priority activities, which the ASEAN Leaders welcomed at the 35th ASEAN Summit. The activities cover areas, such as providing equipment for the reception and transit centres in Rakhine State, building infrastructure, and strengthening communication between officials and displaced persons to facilitate repatriation. More recently, at the ASEAN Foreign Ministers' (FMs) Retreat in January this year, the ASEAN FMs tasked the Support Team to identify further concrete projects through which ASEAN could help to improve the ground conditions in Rakhine State.  ASEAN is committed to sustaining efforts to address this problem. We have also encouraged Myanmar to continue implementing the remaining recommendations of the final report of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State.Both Myanmar and Bangladesh have reaffirmed their commitment to repatriate the refugees. ASEAN continues to encourage continued and effective dialogue between the two parties; Myanmar officials, supported by the ASEAN Secretariat and the AHA Centre, made two trips to Cox's Bazar in 2019 to follow up on the recommendations of the preliminary needs assessment report and to speak to Bangladesh officials. Myanmar and Bangladesh should continue to work with the relevant stakeholders including the UN agencies to ensure the repatriation of refugees is conducted in a voluntary, safe, secure and dignified way.  The security situation in Rakhine State remains a grave concern, due to the ongoing armed conflict between the Arakan Army, a Rakhine nationalist armed group, and the Myanmar armed forces (Tatmadaw), including in the territory previously occupied by many of the refugees. This is an internal issue for Myanmar. On its part, ASEAN has urged all Parties to avoid further violence so that humanitarian assistance can reach all those who are in need.We noted that the Independent Commission of Enquiry (ICOE) established by the Myanmar Government submitted its Final Report on 20 January 2020. The Myanmar authorities said it will investigate the crimes alleged in the report and to prosecute where the evidence indicates so. Separately, on 23 January 2020, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordered provisional measures in the case brought against Myanmar by Gambia under the Application on the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide.As a small state, Singapore is a strong proponent of international law, of which the ICJ is an important pillar. We urge all parties to respect the ICJ's decision on provisional measures. We continue to encourage and welcome all efforts to seek transparency and accountability in respect of the situation in Rakhine State. These are important steps to a long-term, sustainable solution that takes into account the concerns and interests of all the different ethnic communities in Rakhine State.ASEAN hopes to see peace and stability return to Rakhine State. ASEAN will continue to support the efforts to create conducive conditions for repatriation to begin. But it is ultimately the responsibility of the Myanmar Government and relevant stakeholders to work towards a viable and durable political solution that addresses the underlying causes of this longstanding and complex problem. This is the only way to resolve this problem definitively."
financial literacy of adults in singapore and trend in past decade,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling asked the Prime Minister (a) what is the current financial literacy of adults in Singapore and what has been the trend in the past decade; (b) what has been done to increase financial literacy; and (c) whether a national framework is in place to measure the impact of digital finance on businesses and individuals.,"Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): Singaporeans' understanding of basic financial concepts is good, has been improving, and can certainly improve further to help them better plan for their future. A Financial Planning Attitudes Survey commissioned by MoneySense in 2017 showed that about 9 in 10 Singapore residents understood that an investment with a higher return often comes with higher risk. This is significantly higher than the six in 10 in a similar survey conducted in 2013.  However, only about one in five feel that they are knowledgeable about investing. Some Singaporeans also have misconceptions about when to start planning for their finances. One in five feel that they would only need to do financial planning when they are looking to retire; and half of young working adults aged between 17 and 29 have not started thinking about financial planning because they think it is still too early to do so.That is why we must continue our work through MoneySense, to raise the level of financial literacy amongst Singaporeans, to help them make prudent decisions relating to their savings, investments, insurance, house purchase, retirement planning, and not to fall for scams. MoneySense takes a multi-pronged approach, reaching out to Singaporeans at different stages of their lives.  As for the impact of digital finance on businesses and individuals, it is generally positive, because it brings about greater convenience, more accessibility, and in some instances, lower pricing, to banking and financial services. However, it can also mean that consumers are more exposed to products with higher risk, and which requires them to have a higher level of financial literacy.   MAS has been closely monitoring these trends and continually updating its regulatory policies to promote digital financial services, while guarding against risks. Let me cite a few specific areas where our policies have been evolving. First, e-payments. We have been driving e-payments because it enhances consumer convenience and business efficiency. Today, more than three out of four Singaporeans between 20 and 75 years old have registered for PayNow, and an estimated 60% of active businesses have registered with PayNow Corporate. The total monthly transaction value is S$1.6 billion compared to S$1 billion six months ago, so adoption and growth is strong.  But cybersecurity is a concern in e-payment. MAS has issued guidelines for e-payments user protection and technology risk management by financial institutions. Financial institutions have to ensure that they implement robust cybersecurity measures. Parliament also enacted the Payment Services Act, so that we have fit-for-purpose regulations that set cyber hygiene standards for different payment services licensees. For consumers, MoneySense is also stepping up education to users, to practise good cyber hygiene, such as setting strong passwords and keeping them secure, and being vigilant against phishing and other scams. Second, we are also promoting other digital financial services, such as investment advisory and insurance offerings. Consumers can benefit from a wider choice of more customised products that match their risk profiles, investment goals and life needs. At the same time, MAS has provided more clarity to the industry on the areas that warrant greater oversight, to provide better safeguard for consumers. Third, MAS will be issuing up to five digital bank licenses by the middle of this year. They can potentially provide greater funding access for underserved smaller enterprises, as well as low-cost investment solutions and convenient new banking experiences for consumers. Standards in managing and using data are critical in all of this. Digital banks and other digital financial services are likely to use far more data in their operations than traditional financial services. MAS therefore worked with the financial industry to develop principles to guide the responsible use of artificial intelligence and data analytics in financial services, in a way that promotes fairness, ethics, accountability, and transparency in the use of data by financial institutions."
review of funeral services industry practices and standards following case of cremation mix-up,"Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources in light of the case of a cremation mix up (a) whether it is timely for the Ministry to conduct a review of the industry’s practices and standard operating procedures; (b) what are the preventive measures put in place by NEA following the incident; (c) whether NEA intends to play a bigger role in regulating funeral companies, in particular working with the Association of Funeral Directors Singapore; and (d) how often does NEA inspect and conduct checks on Government after-death facilities to ensure compliance to regulation.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The National Environment Agency (NEA) licenses funeral parlours with embalming facilities. Regarding the wrongful cremation incident on 30 December 2019, NEA's investigation found that the licensed funeral parlour involved had not complied with the regulatory requirement to keep proper records of the deceased received into and moved from the premises.  NEA takes a very serious view of this incident. Funeral directors and funeral parlour operators have the professional and ethical responsibility to ensure that the deceased under their charge are properly accounted for, and handled in a dignified and respectful manner. Immediately following its investigation, NEA suspended the licence of the funeral parlour on 6 January 2020 and stopped the funeral director from using Government after-death facilities. NEA is undertaking enforcement action against the funeral parlour for not keeping proper records of the deceased received into or moved from the premises. The funeral parlour and funeral director are required to rectify the lapses and improve their processes to prevent such an incident from happening. NEA will only lift the suspension when we are satisfied that all necessary measures have been put in place. NEA issued a circular on 10 January to remind all licensed funeral parlours of the licensees' regulatory responsibilities to safeguard environmental hygiene; NEA has also prescribed additional measures, such as the requirement to strengthen the system of identification of the deceased and tightening of access control into and out of the premises. While many licensees already have systems and processes in place, NEA has emphasised to all of them the need to strengthen their systems and uphold high service standards. NEA's follow-up inspections showed that all licensees are complying with these new requirements. NEA will take firm action against any licensee for non-compliance, including suspension or cancellation of the funeral parlour licence in the case of egregious offences.  NEA is also working with the Association of Funeral Directors (AFD) to uplift the professionalism and standards of the funerary services industry. The AFD already has a Code of Conduct to guide funerary industry professionals on the conduct of their business. NEA is identifying further areas for improvement in training standards and process workflow. We will make these plans known when ready.   NEA operates Government-owned after-death facilities, such as the Mandai Crematorium and Columbarium Complex and the Choa Chu Kang Cemetery Complex. A quality management system based on ISO standards is in place at these facilities and processes comply with regulatory requirements. NEA officers adhere to comprehensive standard operating procedures that include stringent checks of particulars and documents at each step of the cremation or burial process. My Ministry and NEA are working with the funerary services industry, in consultation with religious leaders, to review how we can further improve controls and uplift the standards of the industry. I urge all funerary services industry professionals to step up and continuously improve their operations to achieve higher service standards and better accountability. If required, we are prepared to consider further regulations on the funerary services industry.                   "
steps taken by schools when students fail to report at their secondary schools,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Education with regard to school absenteeism (a) what are the standard operating procedures when students fail to report at their secondary schools; (b) what is the minimum period of absenteeism before these procedures are activated; (c) what is the number of absenteeism dealt with by secondary schools over the last 10 years; and (d) how successful are the schools in reducing absenteeism and whether further intervention is necessary.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: When Secondary one students fail to report at their new schools, their respective primary schools will be informed and asked to contact the students and their parents. If they had been absent without good reason, the Primary school will counsel and urge the students to report for school, or the parents to send them to schools. Should the students have any difficulties or are caught in special circumstances, the schools will work with relevant Government agencies and community groups to resolve the issues they are facing.  For Secondary school students who are absent on any given day, all schools have in place a system to contact their parents to find out the reasons for their absence. Students who suffer from irregular school attendance will be counselled, and receive home visits and after-school engagement. School counsellors and Student Welfare Officers may also work with the family and other community partners to encourage them to return to school. In addition, we have organised after-school programmes and activities that engage these students by building friendships and relationships with mentors and trusted adults, and generate healthy peer support. Last year, more than 70 Secondary schools have set up after-school centres offering such programmes, and these have benefited more than 3,000 students. This has been scaled up to 120 Secondary schools this year. As a result of coordinated whole-school efforts, the number of Secondary school students who were absent without valid reason for 60 days or more has stabilised at around seven per 1,000 students for the past three years.Nonetheless, there are still some students who are absent from school. The underlying reasons for their long-term absenteeism are often complex. To support these students and their families, MOE taps on the expertise and networks of partner agencies, such as the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), community or self-help groups, family service centres and social service agencies. Furthermore, UPLIFT (Uplifting Pupils in Life and Inspiring Families Taskforce) will collaborate with MSF to tackle long-term absenteeism upstream through a pilot community-based support network for disadvantaged students in the estates of Woodlands, Kreta Ayer and Boon Lay. Schools will identify students who show early signs of absenteeism and refer them to a designated UPLIFT Town-Level Coordinator (TLC) in the Social Service Office. The TLC will then connect the students and their families to suitable local programmes and resources, to build protective safeguards around the student and family earlier, so as to encourage the student to attend school regularly.                "
plans to reduce greenhouse emissions from oil refining industry,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether the Government has any plans to reduce greenhouse emissions from our oil refining industry and, if so, what are these plans.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Under the Paris Agreement, Singapore has pledged to reduce our emissions intensity by 36% from 2005 levels by 2030, and to stabilise our emissions with the aim of peaking around 2030. To achieve this, we have to make our economy more carbon efficient.  The industry sector, in particular the energy and chemicals (E&C) sector, is an important pillar of Singapore's economy. The E&C sector contributes to about 3% of our GDP and employed about 26,000 workers in 2018. However, the industry sector is also a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions, contributing about 60% of Singapore’s total emissions in 2017. Around three-quarters of the industry sector's emissions are from the refining and petrochemicals sector.  Improving industrial energy efficiency is thus a key pillar of our strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and we have put in place a set of comprehensive measures to achieve this. From 2019, facilities in the manufacturing, power generation, waste and water management sectors which emit 25,000 tCO2e or more annually must pay the carbon tax. The current tax rate is set at $5 per tCO2e for the first five years. We will review this by 2023, with the intention of raising the carbon tax rate to $10 to $15 per tCO2e by 2030, taking into account international climate change developments, the progress of our emissions mitigation efforts, and our economic competitiveness.In addition, since 2013, large emitters are required under the Energy Conservation Act (ECA) to submit annual energy efficiency improvement plans. From 2021, these emitters must also establish facility-wide energy management systems and conduct energy efficiency opportunities assessments, which must be submitted to the NEA. To incentivise companies to adopt more energy efficient technologies, the Government also provides funding support which has been increased from the previous cap of 30% to 50% of the qualifying costs since January 2019.  For the oil refineries in particular, the Government works closely with the sector to ensure that they achieve high standards of energy efficiency and adopt sustainable practices. Currently, all three oil refineries in Singapore have set up co-generation plants in their facilities. These are major investments that significantly improve the energy efficiency of the refineries. Beyond particular sectors or industries, all of us have a responsibility to reduce our carbon footprint. Saving electricity, using public transport and reducing waste are good ways to cut carbon emissions. All of us can do our part to help address global warming.                 "
prosecution of social media impersonation cases,"Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) out of the 672 social media impersonation scam cases reported to have occurred in the first 11 months of 2019, how many of the impersonators have been prosecuted so far; (b) what is the average time taken to solve each case; (c) what are the measures that the Anti-Scam Centre has put in place to address the rise in cases; and (d) whether the Anti-Scam Centre will be looking to coordinate anti-scam measures with social media companies.","Mr K Shanmugam: The bulk of the social media impersonation scams reported in 2019 involved victims revealing their credit card details to a scammer masquerading as a friend or relative. The scammers subsequently used the details to make purchases on various online shopping platforms. In other cases, the scammers impersonated friends or relatives of the victims to ask for loans, which were paid into the scammers' bank accounts. These scams mostly originated from foreign jurisdictions. It is difficult to identify the scammers, as they operate on the internet using false identities. Hence, convictions are very difficult. Where available, the Police will share information with foreign counterparts to aid their investigations and to trace the stolen funds. Of the cases of social media impersonation scams reported between January and November 2019, the Police have concluded investigations for 17, all of which originated overseas. In some of these cases, investigations surfaced local parties involved in the movement of the stolen monies, but these local parties did not have knowledge of the actual scams. There have been no prosecutions so far, due to the reasons I shared earlier.The average time taken to solve a case depends on many factors, some of which are case-specific, such as the availability of evidence or witnesses, and the complexity of the case.The Anti-Scam Centre, or ASC, plays two roles in the fight against scams. First, the freezing of suspicious bank accounts that are detected to be involved in scams, typically within a day of notification. Second, obtaining banking information on those accounts, usually within a few days. The quick freezing of bank accounts has increased the recovery rate of victims' funds, from around 4% to 8% prior to the ASC's formation, to approximately 35% today. So far, three local banks and seven foreign banks have started working with the ASC on this. The ASC would like to bring more banks on board. The Police are also working with social media companies, such as Facebook, to explore initiatives to combat online harms that are being perpetrated on their platforms, such as scams.  But public education remains the key. A discerning public is our best defence. In response to the rise in social media impersonation scams, Police have issued media advisories to raise the public's awareness of the scammers' modus operandi, and provide crime prevention advice.                 "
ensuring safety of students as they travel overseas for regional exposure given conflicts and economic instability globally,Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked the Minister for Education given rising conflicts and economic instability around the world (a) how does this impact the Global Education Programme; and (b) what is being done to ensure students' safety and continued access to regional exposure as well as work and study opportunities.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: Student safety is paramount for all our Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs). In planning for overseas programmes, including those under the Global Education Programme, the IHLs take into account MFA's and other international travel advisories, and feedback from their industry and other partners. Should IHLs assess that the planned overseas destination is unsafe or no longer suitable for other reasons, they will make alternative plans, such as changing the destination or postponing the programme until the situation in the host country stabilises. Where necessary, the IHL will cancel the programme. For example, ITE recently cancelled programmes to Hong Kong due to on-going street protests which turned violent. All IHL students bound for overseas programmes are also required to attend pre-trip briefings on safety precautions and what to expect during their visits. The briefing covers important aspects such as mandatory e-registration with MFA, travel insurance coverage, and various emergency assistance hotlines.  Should an overseas emergency occur, all IHLs have crisis management plans that will kick into place to protect students as much as possible and keep parents updated of the situation. If necessary, IHLs also engage international service providers to provide emergency medical assistance and evacuation.                     "
noise barriers along kranji expressway adjacent to residential units along segar estate and blossom residences,Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the Ministry will consider installing noise barriers along the stretch of Kranji Expressway (KJE) running adjacent to the residential units along Segar Estate and Blossom Residences; and (b) what is the estimated cost of installing such noise barriers on a per metre basis.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: To reduce traffic noise along this stretch of the Kranji Expressway (KJE), the Land Transport Authority will implement a low-noise pavement mix for the at-grade section by 1Q2022. Trials have shown that this low-noise pavement mix, is more effective in reducing noise for residents than vertical noise barriers. Noise barriers which cost about $4,000 to $5,000 per metre, are not suitable for this stretch as it will hinder the visibility of on-coming traffic. LTA will continue to explore new and cost effective ways to mitigate the impact of traffic noise and improve the quality of living for residents living near expressways. "
annual number of singaporeans travelling overseas and number of tourist arrivals into singapore,Mr Seah Kian Peng asked the Minister for Trade and Industry in the last three years (a) what is the annual number of Singaporeans travelling overseas and whether the trend is likely to increase; (b) what is the average number of days spent overseas by Singaporeans; and (c) what is the annual number of tourist arrivals to Singapore and what is their average stay.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: In 2019, Singaporeans made about 24.9 million overseas trips. Over the last five years, the number of overseas trips has shown a gradual increase of about 0.2% per annum. We do not have data on the average number of days Singaporeans spent overseas. Over the last five years, tourist arrivals grew at an average rate of almost 5% per annum, to more than 19 million tourists in 2019. Their average length of stay is 3.4 nights. "
"number of students attempted suicide, died by suicide or suffered from self-harm in last three years","Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Education in the last three years (a) how many students (i) attempted suicide (ii) died by suicide or (iii) suffered from self-harm; (b) how many of these students were (i) seeing school counsellors (ii) referred to mental healthcare professionals, broken down into the types of services and institutions and (iii) from the elite schools versus neighbourhood schools; (c) what is the protocol given to (i) students (ii) teachers (iii) school administrators and (iv) counsellors when they learn from a student who shares his suicidal ideations or self-harm behaviour; (d) how does the Ministry balance between safeguarding confidentiality and involving the student’s family; and (e) what is the protocol for post-suicide intervention, including for family.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: We know how Ms Anthea Ong feels strongly about this issue. MOE is deeply concerned about the mental well-being of students too. Parents, teachers, counsellors and peers need to work together to look out for students in distress and reach out to support them.  But I am not sure if it is useful to cite all the data that Ms Anthea Ong asked for. If the purpose of the data is to persuade MOE to treat the issue seriously, I want to assure Ms Ong that MOE does not need persuasion, because schools are at the frontline in confronting this issue. On the other hand, tabulating and publicising such data can have other implications, such as heightening suicide risk in vulnerable youths. I may be paranoid, but I do not want to treat this lightly.  But if I may just cite one data, which is the incidence rate of suicides from ICA.  Their data for young persons aged 10 to 19 shows that over the past three years, from 2016 to 2018, incidents per 100,000 persons were 4.2, 2.7 and 4.4. The 2019 numbers are not yet available. In general, our suicide numbers are not high by international standards.   On the protocol of handling cases, our trained teachers and school personnel will try to build a bridge to the child while ensuring his/her safety and well-being. They also work closely with parents and care-givers, and engage professional or emergency assistance, when necessary. Schools are also supported by specialist teams from MOE HQ and other agencies when needed.  We treat the information related to the counselling of our students with confidentiality. However, in the managing of suicide related cases, we will share pertinent information with relevant individuals, including parents and mental health professionals, when necessary. This is aligned to the professional practices of counsellors, psychologists, medical personnel, in handling cases involving the possibility of harm to self and others.When there is a suicide, our school personnel will need to identify those who may be emotionally affected, and render the appropriate support according to their needs. We need to watch out for possible suicide contagion and intervene when necessary. As for the bereaved families, it is most difficult. We can only do our best to be supportive, to listen and do whatever that is within our means to help. We also partner community agencies, such as SOS, which specialises in rendering such support to the bereaved. Grieving involves many stages. There may be a stage where the bereaved needs someone to blame, and if it is the school, so be it.  Ultimately, our schools is a major line of defence against youth suicides. For most, schools are where they find friends, learn, enjoy growing up, and find support and a listening ear in teachers. This is one of many quiet missions of our schools, and we will welcome partners to work with us.             "
more protection against discrimination from employers for patients who receive mental health treatment,Mr Ong Teng Koon asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry can offer patients who receive mental health treatment more protection against discrimination by their employers by giving patients the option not to disclose the treatment received and the medicine prescribed in their medical bills that are used for reimbursement purposes.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Currently, under the Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Regulations (PHMCR), all medical clinic licensees are required to provide itemised bills for medical treatment provided. This provides greater price transparency and enables the public to make informed choices. An employer is required under the Employment Act to pay for medical consultations of an employee who has worked for at least three months and received at least one day of paid sick leave as certified by a medical practitioner from an approved public medical institution or appointed by the company. While Human Resource (HR) practices for medical reimbursement may vary across companies, no further details on a patient's condition or medical treatment would be released to an employer by the medical institution without the employee's explicit consent, due to patient confidentiality. It is important to continue our efforts to reduce the social stigma of mental health conditions such that persons with mental health conditions will face less risk of discrimination. To this end, efforts have been made to increase awareness of and de-stigmatise mental health conditions. For example, the National Council of Social Service (NCSS), in partnership with the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), has launched an anti-stigma campaign called ""Beyond the Label"", which seeks to facilitate conversation about mental health, positively influence the public's perception of individuals with mental health conditions, and to educate and equip the public to support them in their recovery. MOH also works with partners such as the Health Promotion Board (HPB) and the Ministry of Education (MOE) to educate specific target groups regarding mental well-being, such as through workplaces and schools. MOH has also implemented initiatives under the Community Mental Health Masterplan in 2012 to better identify individuals at risk of mental health conditions and support them with appropriate referrals to access care. The Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment Practices (TAFEP) recently revised their guidelines for job application forms to state that declarations on mental health conditions on job applications forms are discriminatory and should be removed unless there is a good reason to require that information. This was a positive step in de-stigmatising mental health conditions in society. For individuals who feel they have faced unfair discrimination in the workplace, they can also approach TAFEP for advice and help. We continue to work towards a more inclusive society which supports those with mental health conditions.                    "
criteria for admission of foreign students to public education institutions,"Mr Seah Kian Peng asked the Minister for Education (a) whether he can outline the criteria for admission of foreign students to our public education institutions (primary, secondary, polytechnics, junior colleges and tertiary institutions); (b) whether there are specific caps on the numbers of foreign students in these institutions; and (c) how are the fees charged for foreign students vis-á-vis that for local students.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: Our public education system is designed and developed to cater to the needs of Singaporeans. Singaporean students are admitted first, before we consider taking in a small number of foreign students. Hence, no Singaporean student will be displaced by a foreign student.  For example, foreign students seeking admission to our Primary schools can only register in Phase 3 of the Primary 1 Registration Exercise, after all Singaporean children have been allocated a place under earlier phases. Likewise, the Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) first admit Singaporean students who are able to meet their admission standards. Thereafter, they will raise the admission criteria, and then admit a small proportion of foreign students.In our Primary schools, Secondary schools and Junior Colleges, less than 5% are foreign students. In Polytechnics and Autonomous Universities, the proportion is less than 10%.  Fees are differentiated by nationality to reflect the privileges of citizenship, and so foreign students pay significantly higher fees than local students. In primary school, a Singaporean student pays $156 in fees every year while a foreign student pays up to $8,556. For Secondary school, the annual fees for Singaporeans and foreign students are $300 and $15,240 respectively. For pre-university, the corresponding figures are $396 versus $19,524 per year.  Foreign students at our Polytechnics and AUs may apply for the Tuition Grant in return for a service obligation. Those who receive the Tuition Grant will pay at least double the amount of fees that a Singaporean student pays.                           "
drivers penalised for not securing loads properly on trucks in last three years,"Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) over the past three years, how many drivers have been caught and penalised for not securing loads properly on lorries and trucks; (b) how many accidents have there been involving loads falling off such vehicles and injuring road users; and (c) whether there is a need for stronger measures to ensure that drivers secure loads properly to their vehicles.","Mr K Shanmugam: From 2017 to 2019, there were 234 violations of drivers failing to properly secure the loads on their lorries and trucks. Fourteen of these violations resulted in accidents with injuries; there were no fatalities.Traffic Police (TP) regularly conducts engagement sessions with heavy vehicle drivers to share information on road safety. This includes the importance of properly securing loads on their vehicles. The Workplace Safety and Health Council's advisory on ""Workplace Safety and Health Guidelines on Safe Loading of Vehicles"" includes guidance on proper loading and securing techniques for different types of cargo.Under the Road Traffic Act, it is an offence for motorists not to secure their loads properly. The composition sums for this offence were raised on 1 April 2019 – up to $200 for light vehicles and up to $250 for heavy vehicles. Offenders will also be penalised with up to six demerit points. As the number of violations detected by TP has generally been low and the composition sums were only recently increased, we will monitor the situation, and consider further action where necessary."
payment for medications by civil service pensioners for prescriptions issued by community hospitals but not for prescriptions issued by general hospitals,Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked the Prime Minister (a) why elderly pensioners utilising their Civil Service Cards to fulfil prescriptions issued by community hospitals have to pay for these medications whereas general hospitals' prescriptions can be filled for free; (b) whether patients are informed of this discrepancy when they are transferred from general hospitals to community hospitals; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider extending this medication benefit for pensioners discharged from community hospitals.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing (for the Prime Minister): Since 2017, we have extended the Civil Service inpatient medical benefits to cover hospitalisation expenses, including medication up to the point of discharge, incurred by pensioners at Community Hospitals. Our coverage rules for medication apply equally across Restructured Hospitals and Community Hospitals, including those run by Volunteer Welfare Organisations. If a pensioner requires continuous medical management at a primary care provider, Civil Service medical benefits also provide for outpatient care expenses at polyclinics and GP clinics, on top of existing government subsidies. The Civil Service will continue to review its medical benefits in consultation with the Ministry of Health (MOH), as the healthcare landscape and model of care evolves."
influenza vaccination rate for children under 16 and proposal for free flu vaccines for them,Mr Chong Kee Hiong asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the influenza vaccination rate for children under the age of 16; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider providing free flu vaccines to all Singaporean children.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Ministry of Health, in consultation with the Expert Committee on Immunisation, makes recommendations on vaccinations which the population should receive. Influenza vaccination is recommended specifically for children six months to below five years of age at high-risk for influenza complications, and older children with chronic medical conditions, such as asthma and heart disease. Since 2014, MediSave can be used to pay for influenza vaccination among these groups to encourage take-up.Although more children are receiving influenza vaccination, more can be done to improve the take-up. Based on voluntary notification to the National Immunisation Registry, about 14,000 children below five years of age received influenza vaccination in 2019, while the number was around 4,600 in 2014. My Ministry is looking into how to strengthen awareness on the need for influenza vaccination in the recommended groups, and to facilitate access to vaccination."
projected impact on price of treated water for local consumption after 2022,"Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources in light of Malaysia's plan to reduce Johor's dependency on treated water supply from Singapore by 2022, what will be the projected impact on the price of treated water for local consumption after 2022.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The future price of water in Singapore will need to consider all factors relevant at that time. We have not been formally notified by Malaysia that they require less treated water from Singapore. As such, it is premature for us to answer the question."
impact of recent un climate talks (cop25) on singapore,"Mr Seah Kian Peng asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources with the failure of recent UN Climate Talks (COP25), what are the implications for Singapore.","17 Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether he will provide an update on the progress made at the 25th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC COP25) which took place in December 2019; and (b) what further steps can Singapore undertake to do its part to create a more green and sustainable global environment. Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: COP25 was the longest COP on record, with intensive and protracted negotiations. But Parties failed to reach an agreement on a number of issues, most notably Article 6 of the Paris Agreement – a key agenda item on carbon markets and trading, and the only remaining track that has yet to find a successful resolution since the Paris Agreement was adopted in 2015. An agreement on Article 6 on carbon markets will enable countries to pursue cost-effective mitigation options beyond their shores. Put simply, it will enable countries with limited mitigation potential to buy carbon credits from countries where the cost of mitigation is lower. The latter countries are usually those with green lungs and such a system will incentivise them to maintain them. The Article 6 framework can also generate much needed funding for vulnerable developing countries to cope with the impacts of climate change in the future.It is crucial that countries agree on a clear, balanced and credible set of rules that protects environment integrity and upholds the goals of the Paris Agreement. Badly designed rules may create loopholes and lead to an increase in global emissions. At COP25, we were close to an agreement, but more work remains for it to be agreed upon by all Parties. Singapore will continue to work closely with other countries, including the incoming UK COP-26 Presidency, to secure a credible outcome on Article 6 at the COP-26 in Glasgow. Notwithstanding the failure to reach agreement on this key issue, we did make some progress at COP25. Countries successfully adopted the overarching decisions at COP25, which I was pleased to co-facilitate with Spain's Minister for the Ecological Transition Teresa Ribera, at the request of the Chilean COP25 Presidency. Amongst other things, the decisions recognised the role of multilateralism, at a time when it is under strain. They will serve to keep countries, with diverse interests, united in their resolve to work together to address challenges of the global commons, like climate change. They called on countries to consider the emissions gap and to submit their updated climate pledges. The decisions also acknowledged the role of climate finance by the developed countries, which is essential for concrete action. Beyond the call for action, discussions will be convened in new areas of concern like the Ocean and its climate impact. While the outcome at COP25 fell short of expectations, the decisions adopted in Madrid will keep the drive to address climate change alive. The continued momentum on global climate action is especially important for small countries like Singapore, which depend on a strong global response to tackle climate change. I was particularly struck by the support and energy of our civil society, particularly the youths, private sector representatives, and academics, who were all united in their efforts to address climate change. As we head towards the next COP in Glasgow, the challenge will be to maintain this spirit of inclusive multilateralism in order to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement and the UNFCCC.As a small low-lying state that is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, Singapore will play our part to support the global effort to address climate change. Internationally, Singapore remains committed to faithfully implementing our Paris commitments. We have committed to slow down and ultimately cap our CO2 emissions around 2030. We will update our Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) and communicate our long-term low emissions development strategy in 2020. We will also continue to contribute to global efforts led by international organisations such as the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to reduce emissions, as well as collaborate actively with international partners, such as the UNFCCC, the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), ASEAN and city-networks, such as the C40, to share our experiences and the use of best practices across the globe.Regionally, we will continue to partner and support fellow developing countries to ramp up capacity-building and other support mechanisms to support their efforts to enhance climate action. For example, in October 2019, as part of our Climate Action Package, we co-organised with New Zealand a workshop on the Paris rulebook to help countries in the region better understand their obligations under the Paris Agreement, and to identify concrete actions and strategies that can be pursued. Next week, we will be co-organising a workshop on updating NDCs for ASEAN countries.Nationally, we will continue with our efforts to develop Singapore in a sustainable and socially-inclusive way, do our part to reduce our emissions, and strengthen our climate resilience for the transition to a low-carbon future. Singapore has implemented an economy-wide carbon tax last year – the first in Southeast Asia to do so – as a key plank of our mitigation strategy. The revenue will be used to support emission reduction projects and help businesses become more resource and energy efficient. Despite limited access to alternative sources of energy, we will leverage long-term planning, innovation, and international cooperation to address climate change. By pursuing circular economy approaches, and rallying stakeholders towards sustainable growth, we can continue to create opportunities for our businesses and our people, in an increasingly resource- and carbon-constrained world. Last year, we launched a Zero Waste Masterplan and enacted a Resource Sustainability Act to design waste and wastefulness out of our economy. Our efforts to promote a circular economy, where materials are retained and reused in the value chain for as long as possible, will help to reduce our carbon footprint and complement our efforts to address climate change. We will continue with our sustainability efforts this year by focusing on food and how we can work together to secure a more resilient and sustainable supply of food for our citizens. Climate change is an existential challenge for Singapore. To ensure that future generations can continue to enjoy a vibrant and liveable city, we must put sustainability at the centre of everything we do. Yet, climate change is not something that we can tackle by ourselves, and we will also do our part as a responsible global citizen and contribute to international and regional efforts to address climate change and create a ""greener"" and more sustainable global environment."
"addressing homelessness problem as reported in study of over 1,000 people sleeping in the rough","Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Social and Family Development how is the Ministry addressing the homelessness problem highlighted by a recent study that found over 1,000 people sleeping in the rough.","Mr Desmond Lee: Dr Lee Bee Wah and Ms Anthea Ong have also filed questions on addressing homelessness for the next sitting. I will address them together with this reply. MSF considers a person to be homeless if he does not have access to housing. This includes people who have no home. It also includes rough sleepers who have homes but face difficulty returning for various reasons such as serious hoarding, or conflict with family members or co-tenants. We seek to assist all homeless people and rough sleepers in need of help, to ensure their safety and well-being.Homeless people often grapple with multiple complex issues that require Government and community support. However, some of them may not know where to seek assistance; while others may decline help or avoid contact with social services and Government agencies. Therefore, MSF adopts a community-based social work approach to assisting the homeless. Since late 2017, MSF has been partnering various community groups1 and Government agencies in regular night walks so as to better reach out to and engage homeless people and rough sleepers, and share with them that there are shelters and services available. We would refer them to appropriate help agencies that can work with them on their immediate needs as well as underlying issues, so as to improve their circumstances. This collaboration led to the formal launch of the PEERS Network, which stands for Partners Engaging and Empowering Rough Sleepers Network, in July 2019. Partners in the PEERS Network refer homeless people that they have reached out to and befriended to help agencies and shelters to help them attain stable housing and address other longer-term issues such as employment and family conflicts. MSF funds Social Service Agencies to provide shelter and social support at Transitional Shelters2 to homeless persons who require social work intervention to address their underlying issues. Social workers at the Transitional Shelters work with residents on their financial, employment, health and family issues, and help them to secure long-term stable housing. We aim to help residents at Transitional Shelters move into stable long-term accommodation within six months. An extension of stay can be granted if social workers assess that the residents need more time to work on their issues.I would like to thank all our partners for working closely with us to provide better support for the homeless.A small proportion of rough sleepers encountered by MSF have no family support and are unable to care for themselves, and may be considered to be destitute. We offer them care and rehabilitation at Welfare Homes, with the aim of reintegrating them back into the community. Statutory powers under the Destitute Persons Act are exercised only as the last resort in instances where the individual's safety has been assessed to be at risk, or the individual lacks mental capacity to make informed decisions for his welfare. MSF has also collaborated with our PEERS partners to set up ""Safe Sound Sleeping Places"", or S3Ps, to provide rough sleepers a safe environment to rest for the night. S3Ps are ground-up initiatives set up with the goodwill of our community partners. They are sited in the premises of our community partners, which are located near to where the homeless persons sleep rough. To ensure the safety of others resting at the S3Ps, our community partners generally require rough sleepers to meet some basic conditions, such as refraining from consuming alcohol. Rough sleepers can stay at S3Ps until their issues have been resolved, they have been referred to Transitional Shelters, or they have secured longer-term housing options. S3Ps complement existing shelter and residential options, making it easier for government and social service agencies to engage homeless people and rough sleepers in a timely manner. There are currently seven S3Ps with space for up to 56 individuals, with two more S3Ps in the pipeline. About 1 in 5 of all rough sleepers whom we reach out to on joint night walks with PEERS partners have accepted shelter at S3Ps. For the others who decline shelter, MSF and our partners continue to engage them, to persuade them to take up shelter. MSF has also strengthened coordination between Government agencies to ensure that all rough sleepers whom we encounter are offered assistance. An inter-agency taskforce, consisting of 11 Government agencies3, was set up in May 2018. It reviews policies, programmes and protocols to address issues faced by homeless persons and rough sleepers. It also looks into upstream measures to prevent those at risk of losing their homes from becoming homeless. The taskforce builds on MSF's ongoing work to strengthen social service delivery, as well as the work of an earlier taskforce which had been set up in 2007 to strengthen inter-agency coordination on rough sleeping issues.Ms Anthea Ong asked about the joint tenancy requirement for HDB's public rental housing. Minister Lawrence Wong will address this in his reply to Assoc Prof Daniel Goh's other Parliamentary Question on this same issue.  Our strong partnership with the PEERS network partners has enabled us to reach out to more homeless persons and rough sleepers in need, and to offer our support. MSF will continue to bring together more community partners into the PEERS Network, and support those who are willing to open up their premises as S3Ps for homeless people and rough sleepers.  If members of the public encounter any homeless individuals, they can play a part by calling the ComCare hotline at 1800 222 0000, or refer them to the nearest Social Service Office or Family Service Centre for assistance."
interim findings of incident involving nsf during parachute training in taiwan,Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for Defence what are the facts and interim findings surrounding the training accident involving Pte Joshua Quek on 18 December 2019.,"Dr Ng Eng Hen: PTE Joshua Quek undertook a night static line parachute jump as part of the Basic Airborne Course on December 18, 2019 when the training incident occurred. The jumpers' parachutes are attached to the aircraft by a cord called a ""static line"". As jumpers exit the aircraft, the static line becomes taut, and deploys the parachutes automatically. This training activity is standard airborne training conducted by militaries to teach soldiers the fundamentals of parachuting for combat deployment. PTE Quek successfully landed within the designated landing area but sustained injuries to the neck during the course of that jump. He was attended to immediately by SAF's on-site medical officer, and subsequently evacuated by the on-site ambulance to the nearest tertiary hospital. A formal Board of Inquiry, supported by the SAF Inspector General's Office (IGO), has been convened by the Army for a full investigation of this incident. In the meantime, all static line parachute jumps has been suspended, pending the findings of the BOI.Without prejudicing the ongoing formal inquiry, let me now share findings from investigations thus far, with the caveat that these findings are preliminary and the BOI's report will be the final and conclusive one.The cause of PTE Quek's injury occurred when the static line swept across his neck when he exited the aircraft. This is a known risk for static-line parachute training and termed ""static line interference"". It occurs when the line is too slack and interferes with the jumper's exit from the plane. The SAF conducts about 6,000 static line parachute jumps every year. Since its inception in 1974, the SAF has graduated approximately 27,000 BAC trainees. This is the first known ""static line interference"" incident resulting in serious injury.To ensure that static line interference does not occur, there are established drills and safety protocols in the training manuals and TSR for both the jumper and the jump-master. For all jumps, a qualified jump instructor is required to be on board the plane with two qualified Jump Masters (JM) at the exit door to check that these measures and other safety aspects are adhered to.  Preliminary findings suggest that the static line was not pulled taut as required and interfered with PTE Quek's exit from the plane causing a neck injury. Detailed investigations are underway to determine why this occurred and if adequate supervision was given during PTE Quek’s jump.Thus far, we know that PTE Quek had successfully undergone the requisite pre-jump qualifications, training drills and safety briefs prior to taking part in the series of live static line parachute jumps and the specific jump on the night of 18 December. The incident occurred during PTE Quek's fifth and final jump for the course. He had completed the previous four static-line jumps successfully in the days prior to the incident.  Upon arrival at the hospital, a Magnetic Resource Imaging (MRI) revealed a cervical spine injury. In the morning of 19 December, PTE Quek successfully underwent surgery to relieve the pressure on his spine. A planned second surgery on 21 December to stabilise his cervical spine was also successfully completed without complications. PTE Quek is currently still in the ICU for close observations. The cervical spine injury sustained by PTE Quek had resulted in neurological deficits including weakness of his upper and lower limbs. Some partial recovery of motor functions has taken place since the second surgery, but PTE Quek will require continued rehabilitation and physiotherapy for long term recovery as well as to reduce the damage from the injury. Currently, he is able to breathe on his own, conscious and alert and able to talk with his family.PTE Quek's family was informed of the incident on the night of 18 December and his mother was flown to the hospital the next day. His father and brother joined him a few days after. SAF personnel are also on site to provide PTE Quek and his family medical, counselling, logistical and other forms of support.  The Board of Inquiry will comprehensively ascertain the detailed circumstances and possible contributory factors for the incident. It will examine all existing safety processes and procedures, whether they were adhered to and recommend areas for review and enhancement where needed. Static line parachute jumps will remain suspended until the completion of the formal inquiry and only resumed when their recommendations have been implemented.A team of SAF doctors are working closely with the specialists at the hospital to monitor and assess PTE Quek’s condition. While his condition is stable now, the medical opinion is that he stills needs close monitoring over the next few weeks. He will be brought back to Singapore when the specialists deem it safe to fly. All of us, of course wish PTE Quek a continuous and progressive recovery. Our prayers and hopes are with him and his family. MINDEF and SAF will continue to extend our full support to PTE Quek and his family on his road to recovery.                       "
policy to withhold graduation certificates from students with unpaid school fees,"Dr Teo Ho Pin asked the Minister for Education (a) over the last three years, how many students' graduation certificates have been withheld by schools; (b) what are the common reasons for withholding the certificates; and (c) whether the Ministry will review such practices.","14 Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for Education whether the Ministry will review the policy of withholding the original PSLE certificate of students who have not paid their school fees. 15 Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for Education what are the actions taken by a school when a student is unable to make payment of the school fees and under what circumstances will financial assistance be granted to the student. Mr Ong Ye Kung: I have shared my views on this issue with several members of public who wrote to me. One of the replies has been posted online and reported by the media. I do not have a lot to add, but let me reiterate some of the key points.The monthly cash payment for primary schools is – $6.50 for miscellaneous fees, with another $6.50 which is payable by Edusave. So, out of pocket expenses on fees is $6.50.  The amount is low because school education is highly subsidised. But a small payment is still required, to demonstrate that as parents and families, we have a part to play. In fact, most families take this payment very seriously, and it inculcates in children the value of commitment and playing our part, however small. Many of us in the House will remember our school days when we queued up to pay miscellaneous fees to our form teacher. In my case, it was $3 per month. My teacher would always remind me that what we paid was not enough to buy chalk, but still we should do our part. I would then collect the chit – a different colour for each month – and show it to my parents. I think that whole ritual had inculcated some good values in many students, and certainly me. Notwithstanding, some parents accumulate arrears for various reasons. I do not agree with the view that this is because MOE and schools are uncaring. Quite the contrary, schools and teachers are often in the frontline of reaching out to students from vulnerable families and assisting them, including paying home visits and bringing the children to schools.Some of us in our community work come across such families, and wonder why assistance has not been extended to them and whether we are doing enough outreach. But please remember we are all part of the solution, and cannot place the onus solely on schools and teachers. When we know of such cases, surface them to the school, or our community partners, and help will be extended to them. Parents can step forward and request for help if they need financial assistance.  There is a view that it is difficult to apply for financial assistance in school. However, the application process is not difficult.  When families need assistance, teachers and staff would help in filling up the forms.  MOE's Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS) covers not just the school and miscellaneous fees, but also meals, uniforms, textbooks and transport – a large portion of the form is in fact to tick the menu of assistance required. Further, if parents produce a ComCare approval letter, MOE FAS will be automatically granted without the need for any further supporting documents. If one child is granted the MOE FAS, the child’s siblings in our schools will automatically benefit from FAS too.    If after all the above steps have been taken and the parents still accumulate arrears, that is when the original PSLE results slip will be withheld as a last resort. The child will still apply to secondary school and progress like everyone else. Schools are also sensitive about this when distributing the results slip, and will make sure that everyone gets their results the same way.  But I accept the feedback that the child who receives a copy of his results slip instead of the original may feel awkward or embarrassed, through no fault of his. We do not want the children to bear responsibility for the arrears accumulated by their parents.  Further, the current practice of withholding the original results slip may not be fully effective in urging all parents to pay miscellaneous fees. Every year, about 2% of cohort who are still accumulating arrears, and did not apply for MOE financial assistance, are affected. In 2019, this works out to 645 students.    MOE will therefore review the practice, while continuing to underscore the responsibilities of families to pay a small miscellaneous fee. The review will be concluded in time for the next PSLE results release.  Incidentally, I checked on the child in question which had triggered public attention on this issue. The school had reached out to the parents earlier, given them the FAS application form and brochure, but the parents did not apply. On the day of the PSLE results, she had received her results in the same way as everyone else, except hers was a copy. Teachers did not observe her to feel embarrassed or emotionally affected. She has since been successfully placed in a Secondary school of her choice near her home. The parents have submitted the FAS form and she is receiving assistance.     "
measures to enhance income mobility and reduce income inequality,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance what measures are being undertaken to enhance income mobility in addition to reducing income inequality.,"Mr Heng Swee Keat:  The Government is committed to strengthening social mobility in Singapore. This is why our approach has not been to rely narrowly on redistribution to reduce inequality, but also to put in place a broad range of measures to maximise opportunities for all Singaporeans, and enable them to earn their own success.  Our first priority is to ensure a strong, dynamic and resilient economy. Only when our firms are increasing productivity can workers find good jobs with sustained wage increases. We are therefore continuing to help our businesses restructure and succeed in new markets through innovation and enterprise. Beyond the economy, we are addressing social mobility holistically by intervening upstream. This means investing heavily from the preschool years, enabling multiple pathways to success both in the schooling years and working life, and integrating and rejuvenating our neighbourhoods.We are starting early to give every Singaporean the best possible start in life, regardless of family background, because the first few years of a child's life are critical. That is why we have made major enhancements to preschool subsidies, and are expanding the KidSTART programme to provide upstream and integrated support for children from low-income families. We will continue to invest in our education system, to enable every individual to pursue their diverse aspirations and realise their full potential. We are broadening and enhancing our learning pathways through new Work-Study Programmes in our Polytechnics and ITE. Polytechnic graduates can upgrade their skills and earn more through the SkillsFuture Work-Study Post-Diplomas, while ITE graduates will be able to upgrade beyond a Nitec over the course of their career. At the same time, we have recently increased the quantum of bursaries for University and Polytechnic students from lower-income families. We have also embarked on SkillsFuture to build a culture of lifelong learning and skills mastery. Individuals and companies have stepped forward and training participation rates have increased in recent years. But there is still much more work to be done. We will continue to invest in SkillsFuture to help our workers prepare for the rapid transformations that are taking place across all industries.  We are paying closer attention to lower-wage workers, and those who are at risk of being displaced. This is why we have ramped up the Adapt and Grow initiative, which helps job-seekers acquire new skills and take on new jobs. For lower-wage workers, we will continue to enhance their skills and productivity through various measures including the Workfare Income Supplement Scheme, and the Progressive Wage Model.  Our neighbourhoods are a key pillar of social inclusion and mobility. We have made sure that our public housing estates are not stratified or segregated, and built common spaces where residents from all walks of life interact and create shared experiences. We are now stepping up our efforts for families in rental housing, and doing more to help all working Singaporeans own their own homes.  Growth, mobility and inequality are key concerns for all advanced economies. In Singapore, we have put in place a holistic set of measures to enable everyone to move up the ladder. We have achieved broad-based income growth. Over the last five years from 2013 to 2018, real income growth averaged 3.3% per annum for our low-income households1 and 3.4% for our middle-income households. We have also done better than many other countries in social mobility: 14% of those with parents who were in the lowest income quintile when they were growing up, managed to move up to the top quintile of income earners by their early 30s.   The Government will continue to review and enhance its programmes to ensure that all Singaporeans, whatever their starting point, have the opportunity to build a better life for themselves and their families.                               "
trend of impersonation scams in last three years,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is the trend of impersonation scams in the last three years; (b) whether there is an increasing number of elderly victims; and (c) what more can the Ministry do to deter such scam cases and better protect the elderly from such scams.,"Mr K Shanmugam:  Over the last three years, there has been an increase in the number of scam cases reported and amounts cheated. Three types of impersonation scam are of particular concern. They are: (i) China officials impersonation scam; (ii) social media impersonation scam, where scammers use compromised or spoofed social media accounts to pretend to be a victim’s family member or friend; and (iii) tech support scam where scammers pretend to be staff of telecommunications companies or law enforcement officers to deceive victims into installing malicious software onto their computers.There were 401 cases of China officials impersonation scam reported between January and November 2019, a significant increase compared to 188 cases in the whole of 2017. The amounts cheated have also gone up, from at least S$12.8 million in 2017 to at least S$18.8 million between January and November 2019. The age distribution of the victims used to be quite evenly spread. However, in recent years, we see younger victims being targeted, with more than half of the victims in 2019 being young adults below the age of 30.As for social media impersonation scams, there were 71 cases reported with at least S$168,000 cheated in 2017. That number jumped to 672 cases with at least S$7.2 million cheated between January and November 2019. The age distribution of victims has been fairly even over the past three years, with victims in their 20s to 40s accounting for around 60% of all such victims in 2019.The number of tech support scam cases reported increased from 53 in 2017 to 224 in the period from January to November 2019. The amounts cheated have also gone up, from at least S$36,000 cheated in 2017 to at least S$12 million between January and November 2019. Both the elderly and the young have fallen prey to such scams. Criminals are constantly evolving their methods to deceive people into parting with their money. No amount of Police resources will be enough. The key to the fight against scams is a discerning public. We should be sceptical of incredulous inducements promised by scammers, transact only on reliable platforms, and develop a habit of checking with the actual authorities when approached by dubious entities purporting to be officials. To this end, the Police partner the National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC) to raise public awareness. For example, there is a regular ""Scamalert"" segment on ""CrimeWatch"" dedicated to educating the public on scams. A Scamalert.sg website was launched in 2014 to inform members of the public about the latest scam types. The website has had over 1.7 million visits to date. In 2016, the Police and NCPC launched an Anti-Scam Helpline (1800-722-6688) for the public to seek scam-related advice. Direct mailers containing scam-related information are sent to households.The Police also work with the Residents' Committees and grassroots volunteers to spread scam alerts to residents, through community events like block parties, roadshows, festive events and Community Safety and Security Programmes (CSSPs). One such CSSP focusing on the elderly is the Silver Watch Group. Launched in 2013, the initiative aims to impart elderly residents with crime prevention knowledge by keeping them informed of the latest crime situation and encouraging them to share relevant advice with their peers.Everyone has a part to play in the fight against scams. Members of the public are urged to stay vigilant, and report possible scams promptly to the Police.                  "
impact of recent data leaks on confidential operations of mindef and saf,Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Defence (a) what is the assessment on the impact of the data leak which occurred at ST Logistics and the ransomware attack on HMI Institute of Health Sciences to confidential operations of MINDEF and SAF; and (b) what is the follow-up action that is in place following the two incidents.,"22 Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for Defence with regard to the personal data leak affecting 2,400 MINDEF and SAF personnel (a) when did ST Logistics first discover the phishing attack; and (b) when did MINDEF come to know about the leak.Dr Ng Eng Hen: On 10 October 2019, MINDEF discovered that emails received from ST Logistics contained malware, and alerted their management, whereupon ST Logistics as a first precautionary move blocked outgoing data and emails possibly affected by the malware. The company’s IT team and external support teams then carried out forensic investigations to provide MINDEF with the affected data for an impact assessment. It was established on 13 December 2019 that personal data of 2,400 MINDEF/SAF personnel could have been leaked. The affected personnel were notified from 21 December 2019.In the second incident, HMI Institute discovered a malware infection in one backup server on 4 December 2019, and alerted MINDEF on 9 December 2019. With the help of a cybersecurity firm, HMI investigated the infection and ascertained the individuals from MINDEF/SAF and other organisations whose personal data were on the affected backup server. Although the likelihood of data leak to external parties was assessed to be low, the 98,000 MINDEF/SAF personnel were informed from 21 December 2019. Both incidents were confined to the systems of the vendors, and did not affect MINDEF's own systems or result in the loss of classified military information.MINDEF takes a serious view of these cases. We expect our vendors to protect all personal data that has been entrusted to them. Prior to these incidents, MINDEF had begun including personal data protection clauses in all new contracts involving personal data. We had also been working with vendors, including HMI Institute and ST Logistics, to progressively apply such clauses to existing contracts. We will further strengthen oversight of our vendors. Taking reference from the recommendations of the Public Sector Data Security Review Committee (PSDSRC), we will implement a framework to ensure that vendors protect our data well. MINDEF will also implement a tiered cybersecurity framework to ensure that vendors handling more sensitive data are subject to more stringent cybersecurity standards, which may include regular audits. As the risks will continue to evolve, we will continually monitor developments and enhance our cyber and data security measures.         "
update on singapore-kuala lumpur high-speed rail project and singapore-johor bahru rapid transit system,Mr Ang Wei Neng asked the Minister for Transport whether he can provide an update on the latest development pertaining to (i) the Singapore-Kuala Lumpur High-Speed Rail project and (ii) the Singapore-Johor Bahru Rapid Transit System.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Both projects are currently suspended.The Kuala Lumpur – Singapore High Speed Rail (HSR) Project is suspended up to 31 May 2020. Malaysia has requested that both sides discuss the way forward for the HSR Project during the suspension period. To date, Singapore has not received any formal proposal from Malaysia. The Johor Bahru – Singapore Rapid Transit System (RTS) Link Project is suspended up to 30 April 2020. In October 2019, Malaysia conveyed to Singapore its intention to proceed with the RTS Link Project, but with some changes. However, Malaysia was not ready to formally share all the details of its proposed changes with Singapore. We are nevertheless in close discussions on Malaysia’s proposed changes, including the consequential changes to (a) the RTS Link Bilateral Agreement between the two Governments, (b) the Agreement between Singapore's SMRT Corporation and Malaysia's Prasarana Malaysia Berhad to constitute a joint venture Operating Company or ""OpCo"", and (c) a Concession Agreement for the two Governments to appoint this OpCo as the RTS Link operator. When the details of their complete proposal are made available to Singapore, we will make a thorough assessment and give it serious consideration. While Singapore is not obliged to accept Malaysia's proposed changes to the two projects, we keep an open mind and will assess them objectively when we receive them to ensure that they meet Singapore’s requirements, including financial and operational considerations. We remain of the view that both are fundamentally good projects for both countries and will benefit both our peoples."
impact of hdb's co-tenancy policy on homelessness,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for National Development whether the rationale requiring co-tenancy for public rental flats is still relevant today in light of its contribution to homelessness.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB requires two singles to share a rental flat under the Joint Singles Scheme (JSS) to ensure prudent use of our limited land and fiscal resources. This allows our rental flats to serve more low-income Singaporeans who require housing assistance. There are multiple complex issues behind homelessness, and co-tenancy is not the only contributor. In fact, HDB's recent survey indicates that the vast majority of its single tenants under JSS are able to live together amicably. Many of these tenants have no family support. By living together, they can benefit from companionship and provide mutual support. Rent is also more affordable, as it is shared.  HDB offers partitions in the JSS rental flats to provide more privacy for the single tenants. For the few who are unable to get along, HDB will assist with mediation with the help of Grassroots Organisations and the Community Mediation Centre, or facilitate a change in co-tenant or flat if required.HDB will continue to work with MSF and the Partners Engaging and Empowering Rough Sleepers (PEERS) Network to find sustainable housing options for homeless persons, based on their individual circumstances.

reasons for massive traffic jams at 2019 standard chartered singapore marathon and preventive measures,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth with regard to the massive traffic jams caused during the 2019 Standard Chartered Singapore Marathon held from 29 November to 1 December 2019 (a) on what grounds have the road closure and diversion plans been approved; (b) whether consideration has been given to the three other major events happening downtown that weekend; and (c) how does the Ministry intend to review and enhance regulations and requirements for such future events.","27 Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) whether the Ministry has conducted a comparative review of the issues and disruptions that arose from the Standard Chartered Singapore Marathon (SCSM) 2019 held from 29 November to 1 December 2019 in the evening for the first time, against previous years; (b) what are the learning points; (c) whether the Ministry anticipates any inconvenience to individuals near the SCSM 2020 event venue; and (d) whether any changes will be introduced to SCSM 2020 and similar events to mitigate the problems caused by SCSM 2019. 28 Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) what are the reasons for the massive jams during the 2019 Standard Chartered Singapore Marathon; (b) why has this situation not been anticipated; (c) what are the lessons learned; and (d) how can such massive jams be avoided in future large scale events such as marathons. 29 Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth in light of the severe congestion caused by a recently held marathon (a) how does the Ministry balance the supporting of major sporting events and inconvenience to road users; (b) how can commercial organisers be made liable to mitigate against severe congestion; and (c) whether organisers who fail to address road congestion issues previously be prevented from running similar events in future.Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: The Standard Chartered Singapore Marathon (SCSM) is the most anticipated race on Singapore's running calendar and last year marked SCSM's 18th edition. In order to create more conducive running conditions and a better race experience for participants, as well as bring more spectators out into the streets to enjoy the race, the SCSM was organised as an evening race for the first time on Saturday, 30 November 2019. There was a marked increase in the number of participants and spectators, with nearly 30,000 participants running in the marathon and half-marathon events, and more than 70,000 supporters cheering on the runners at the designated spectator zones and along the route.  MCCY and SportSG supported this event as an opportunity to enhance the significance of the event for Singapore from a social, sporting and economic perspective. We aspire to showcase Singapore's vibrancy and character to the world through SCSM as a World Marathon Majors event, alongside the iconic marathons held in Berlin, Boston, Chicago, London, New York and Tokyo. In Singapore, our runners participate in the SCSM to celebrate their resilience and purpose. There is a growing number championing worthwhile causes, such as those helping to raise awareness and funds for people with Parkinson's and the disadvantaged in society. We would like to embrace a spirit of care, inclusion and resilience in our society by encouraging more Singaporeans to be a part of this year-end event.  From the onset, SportSG and the organisers Ironman Asia recognised that the evening timing would be a complex and major undertaking and took the preparations seriously. Preparations for the SCSM 2019 began shortly after the conclusion of the 2018 event. A joint operations committee involving the organisers and various Government agencies, such as LTA and the Traffic Police, was set up to develop and implement traffic plans and minimise inconvenience to the public. A detailed traffic impact study was conducted, and plans took into careful account accessibility for essential services such as hospitals and fire stations. Additional traffic measures were put in place in view of major concurrent events such as the U2 Concert at the Singapore Sports Hub and the Christmas Wonderland at Gardens by the Bay. SportSG also coordinated with the Singapore Tourism Board to engage affected businesses and stakeholders since the start of 2019, where road closure information was shared early with over 150 affected stakeholders to help with their own preparations.  In the weeks leading up to the race, the event organiser ramped up road closure announcements on mainstream and social media platforms. It also beefed up call centre operations to address public queries on the road closures. On event day, 500 Auxiliary Police Officers were deployed at critical road junctions to redirect motorists and advise on alternative routes. Emergency services were facilitated through regardless of the road closures. Roads were progressively opened as the race proceeded, in as safe a manner as possible.MCCY takes the public feedback seriously. We will work with the event organiser and relevant agencies to study these points, including suggestions to de-conflict the SCSM with other major events, and the need to enhance public communications on the road closures. Given the scale of the Singapore Marathon and our ambition for it to be amongst the World Marathon Majors, we recognise that the logistics will pose inconvenience to stakeholders and members of the public in the initial years, and we will keep aiming to improve how future editions are organised. But we hope that with the support of Singaporeans and by working closely with partners, we can build up the SCSM into an event that all Singaporeans can be proud of and look forward to. "
rates of obesity in children and the elderly,"Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked the Minister for Health (a) whether he can provide an update on the current rates of obesity in children, adults and the elderly respectively; (b) how do these figures compare with those of previous years; and (c) what has been the progress and effectiveness of measures to reduce obesity among Singaporeans.","Mr Gan Kim Yong:  Based on the 2017 National Population Health Survey, the prevalence of obesity1 among adult Singaporeans aged 18 to 59 years was 8.9%, and that among seniors aged 60 to 74 years was 6.9%. This has remained stable since 2013. The proportion of overweight2 children in our mainstream schools, aged six to 18 years, has increased from 11% in 2013 to 13% in 20173. MOH and HPB work with other Government agencies to combat obesity through the promotion of physical activity and better diets, such as eating more healthily and reducing daily sugar consumption. This is also in line with our overall strategy in Singapore's War on Diabetes.To promote healthier diets, HPB has introduced programmes such as the Healthier Choice Symbol (HCS) and Healthier Dining Programme (HDP) to increase the availability of healthier options, as well as campaigns such as the Eat, Drink, Shop Healthy Challenge to incentivise healthier purchases. To further create a healthy food environment, HDB and HPB collaborated to include the provision of healthy meals as a consideration in Price-Quality tenders for new eating houses, awarding more points for tenderers that offer healthy meal options. In partnership with MOE and ECDA, HPB has also implemented healthy meals programmes4 in all mainstream schools and eight in 10 preschools, to inculcate healthy eating habits from young. These efforts are complemented by health education outreach in schools in partnership with stakeholders such as South-West Community Development Council, Sengkang General Hospital, and National Youth Achievement Award (NYAA) Council; and at workplaces where HPB works with industry partners to roll out relevant workplace health promotion programmes such as workshops and health coaching.These programmes have contributed to better diets. From the National Nutrition Survey 2018, Singaporeans are consuming fewer calories, better-quality carbohydrates consisting more wholegrain, fruits and vegetables, as well as substituting saturated fat with unsaturated fat. However, our sugar intake remains high at 60g per person per day. As such, we will be introducing new regulatory measures for pre-packaged sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), namely nutrition labelling and advertising prohibitions for less healthy SSBs. To encourage exercise, HPB, SportSG, and People's Association offer a wide range of physical activity programmes and sport facilities island-wide. MOE also makes facilities and sports equipment available beyond the formal curriculum time to encourage better utilisation. There are targeted programmes, such as those that cater to at-risk Professional, Managers, Executives and Technicians (PMET) at the workplace to increase the adoption of a more active lifestyle. For seniors, Active Ageing Programmes (AAPs) are also made available at over 600 locations island-wide where the elderly can participate in group exercises and health workshops.Recognising how our living environment can influence behaviours, our infrastructure agencies such as MND, MOT and others have strived to build a city that encourages active lifestyles and mobility. This includes more than 350 parks and gardens, 200km of covered link-ways, and 440km of cycling paths and park connectors; and there are plans to further enhance the living environment to support a more physically active citizenry. All these efforts have led to encouraging results – 80.9% of Singaporeans had sufficient total physical activity in 2017, up from 73.1% in 2013.Reducing obesity in our population requires coordinated and continuous efforts from all relevant stakeholders. In the long term, such efforts may also lead to a reduction in the prevalence of chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension and their accompanying complications. MOH will continue to monitor the trends in obesity, physical activity, and nutritional habits of Singaporeans, and work with the other Government agencies and the wider society to tackle this issue.              "
prevalence of dementia in singapore in past five years and distinguishing dementia from other mental health issues,Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the prevalence and incidence of dementia in Singapore over the past five years; (b) whether our health services are adequately resourced to manage dementia patients given our ageing population; and (c) what has been the progress in the establishment of dementia-friendly communities.,"31 Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Health (a) what lessons are learnt from the implementation of the Community Mental Health Masterplan (CMHM) and National Mental Health Blueprint (NMHB); (b) whether these lessons will influence the next CMHM and NMHB; (c) whether the Ministry will consider running public consultations for these plans; and (d) whether the Ministry will consider distinguishing dementia from mental health conditions under the plans, since they each require different strategies, treatment and support to be dealt with. Mr Gan Kim Yong: In 2007, MOH implemented the National Mental Health Blueprint to improve early detection and treatment for persons with mental health conditions. Subsequently, the Community Mental Health (CMH) Masterplan was launched in 2012 to place more focus on mental health care in the community for persons to receive care closer to home. Through these plans, MOH has increased accessibility and capacity of mental health services in the healthcare institutions and community, facilitated early identification and access to interventions. For example, the Agency for Integrated Care has worked with community service providers to set up 41 community outreach teams to educate the public on mental health conditions and dementia, and refer those with such conditions to the appropriate health and/ or social services. We have also increased access to mental health and/ or dementia services in 12 polyclinics.  According to the Well-being of the Singapore Elderly (WiSE) study 2013, one in 10 seniors aged 60 years and above is estimated to have dementia. We recognise that there are differences in the needs of persons with mental health conditions, such as depression and anxiety, and those with dementia. However, the broad approach is similar, that is to increase access to appropriate care, through early identification, build capabilities and capacity in the community to identify and treat such conditions. With this approach, we have strengthened dementia services in the community. For example, we have established eight Dementia-Friendly Communities (DFCs), to create an inclusive society for persons with dementia and their care-givers. These are neighbourhoods which are equipped to better support persons with dementia and their care-givers to continue living well at home, where residents, grassroots leaders, businesses and the community are trained to recognise dementia signs and symptoms. We are on track to expand the number of DFCs to 15 by 2021.In addition, MOH has more than tripled the number of Dementia Day Care places since 2015. These Day Care Centres can serve up to 3,400 persons with dementia each day. Working care-givers, in particular, can have peace of mind, knowing that their loved ones are well-cared for in the day.MOH has also increased dementia capability and capacity in the acute hospitals. We have piloted new specific inpatient dementia services in three acute hospitals (Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, Changi General Hospital and Institute of Mental Health) and two Community Hospitals (St Luke's Hospital and Saint Andrew's Community Hospital), to cater to patients of varying severity. We are now working to expand such inpatient dementia services to more hospitals to strengthen hospitals' capabilities in inpatient dementia care. Since 2012, we have also grown outpatient Memory Clinic capacity in our acute hospitals, to ensure that persons with dementia have access to early outpatient assessment, detection, multi-disciplinary intervention and care-giver support. For long-term care, new nursing homes developed by MOH are designed with dementia-friendly features to cater to the needs of persons with dementia. We are currently adopting a whole-of-Government approach to review the overall strategy on mental health together with other ministries and stakeholders, and will also consider consultation with relevant stakeholders. The review will take into account learnings from the implementation of our existing mental health plans, such as recruiting more mental health service providers and addressing mental health stigma, to improve awareness of mental well-being and strengthen access to mental health support.                "
collaboration amongst government agencies to test and share new technologies,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Prime Minister (a) how are the different Ministries and agencies collaborating to test and share new technologies; and (b) what are the platforms available for agencies to check on new technologies being piloted to accelerate our collective learning and adoption capabilities.,"Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): Ministries and agencies collaborate to test, share and deploy technologies in three ways.First, we do so by taking a citizen-centric approach, so that technology solutions work across agency boundaries to serve citizens well and solve their problems. For example, under the ""Moments of Life"" initiative, a common platform bundles Government digital services from multiple agencies so that citizens need to transact only through one channel rather than with many different agencies. Second, we build horizontal platforms to share technology resources. The Science & Tech Policy and Planning Office (S&TPPO) is looking at creating a drones-as-a-service platform, for applications like aerial mapping and facade inspection. The Smart Nation and Digital Government Group (SNDGG) is developing the Government Technology Stack and Government Data Architecture, to share software services and data safely and efficiently across agencies. SingPass, for instance, is used by all agencies to transact securely with citizens. SingPass is also being used by businesses, such as NTUC Income and AIA, to allow customers to access their digital services.Third, we pool in-house technical capabilities to serve whole-of-government needs. Centres of Excellence or CentExes have been set up in various engineering fields, to pool expertise within the Government, and build them up in numbers and quality. For example, GovTech serves as the CentEx for Info-communications Technology and Smart Systems; and JTC serves as the CentEx for Building and Infrastructure.CentExes play a functional leadership role in their respective domains. Besides supporting other agencies' engineering needs, they lift engineering standards and disseminate best practices across the public service by a common process of masterplanning, competency and training frameworks. The Public Service Division and S&TPPO also supports learning among agencies, through the organisation of learning circles and capability building workshops.Beyond in-house capabilities, the public sector also makes use of various platforms to learn from and partner the industry and research community. IMDA's Open Innovation Platform matches problem owners, from both public and private sectors, with problem solvers from industry and the research ecosystem. A*STAR's National Robotics Programme forges public-private partnerships to undertake R&D to use robotics to address various public sector challenges.The public sector will continue to work collectively to make the best use of technology to serve citizens and businesses, and improve the quality of city living. We will also work closely with companies and researchers, so that as a nation, we may overcome our natural constraints and raise our economic competitiveness through technological innovation."
pre-schools offering inclusive education for special needs children,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) how many pre-schools currently offer inclusive education for special needs children; (b) whether the current capacity is sufficient to meet demand; and (c) what is the support given to schools to adopt an inclusive model.,"Mr Desmond Lee: Inclusive preschools strive to provide children with developmental needs the opportunity to enrol in pre-schools alongside their typically-developing peers. Today, many preschools already strive to adopt a more inclusive approach and enrol children with mild to moderate developmental needs. To support this inclusion within pre-schools, the Government funds the provision of the Learning Support (LS), Development Support (DS) and Development Support Plus (DS-Plus) programmes. Under these programmes, professionals, such as Learning Support Educators, Early Intervention teachers, therapists and psychologists, provide intervention for children with developmental needs in their pre-schools once or twice a week. They also guide pre-school teachers in adapting their teaching methods and activities, to better engage and integrate these children in the classroom setting.The DS and LS programmes are currently offered at about 550 pre-schools. ECDA is working with sector partners to increase the number of pre-schools that offer DS and LS. The DS-Plus programme was launched in July 2019 to offer more intensive support and will be rolled out to more preschools over time. With the extension of DS-LS and DS-Plus programmes to more pre-schools, we would be able to offer families more timely and accessible support.Currently, the majority of children with moderate to severe developmental needs attend both the Early Intervention Programme for Infants and Children (EIPIC) and pre-schools to ensure that their needs are holistically met. A small number of pre-schools, such as Kindle Garden and Canossaville Pre-school, cater to these children in an inclusive setting. MSF has set up an Inclusive Pre-school Workgroup (IPWG) involving people, private and public sector partners, to learn from the experiences of local and international inclusive pre-schools. The IPWG will develop recommendations on how to better support children with moderate to severe developmental needs within pre-schools.To support pre-school teachers, the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) works with the National Institute of Early Childhood Development (NIEC) and other training institutes to equip them with the skills to support children with developmental needs within an inclusive environment. In pre-service training, early childhood teachers are taught the basics of identifying and working with children with developmental needs, including where to get additional support if needed. In-service teachers can also tap on subsidised post-diploma training and Continuing Professional Development (CPD) courses to deepen their knowledge and skills in this area. NIEC also offers the Specialist Diploma in Early Childhood Learning Support (SDELS) and the Advanced Diploma in Early Childhood Intervention (Special Needs) (ADESN) to equip those who wish to take on specialist roles as Learning Support Educators and Early Intervention teachers respectively to support children with developmental needs. "
review of grab's upfront cash programme offered to delivery riders,Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for Law (a) whether the Ministry will review Grab's Upfront Cash Programme offered to their delivery riders to determine whether the administrative charges are reasonable; and (b) how do the charges compare to rates offered by moneylenders and banks for unsecured lending.,"Mr K Shanmugam: Grab's Upfront Cash Programme has been brought to the attention of the Ministry of Law. We are engaging Grab to find out more about this programme. Let me provide a brief description of the UCP based on what we have gathered from Grab. The UCP is a programme offered to selected Grab's third party service providers, which include GrabCar and GrabTaxi drivers and delivery partners. These service providers derive their income from two sources. First, they earn fees paid directly by users. Second, Grab pays out incentives when they complete certain requirements. For example, a delivery partner may earn an incentive upon completing a certain number of trips within a stipulated time period. Under the UCP, such a selected delivery partner can request to receive their incentive payments in advance, before completing the requirements. If Grab accedes to such requests, it charges the delivery partner an upfront administrative fee before disbursing the balance incentive payment. The Member asked how the charges for Grab's UCP compares. As there are differences in the features, terms and conditions of various products, we would like to caution against making direct comparisons. Nevertheless, let me share briefly the rates offered by Grab. According to Grab, the administrative fee ranges from 5% to 10% of the advance incentive payments granted, and no further fees or interest charges are imposed. Under the regulatory framework for moneylending, licensed moneylenders are permitted to charge an upfront administrative fee of not more than 10% of the loan principal, as well as a nominal interest of up to 4% per month and other prescribed fees. Banks offer a wide range of credit products and charges vary, according to the tenor, risk and other features of the product concerned.We will study further with Grab before assessing what measures need to be taken. We strongly encourage individuals to review the terms of the UCP carefully and assess their ability to complete the requirements and meet the financial commitments before participating in the programme.       "
quality and unique mental health care and support for differently-abled individuals,"Ms Yip Pin Xiu asked the Minister for Health what are the measures to ensure that differently-abled individuals such as individuals who are deaf, mute or autistic receive quality mental health care and support that meet their unique needs.","Mr Gan Kim Yong:  Persons with different abilities are handled by various groups of healthcare professionals in the public healthcare system. Efforts have been made to facilitate early detection and referral for management of mental health conditions for all individuals in Singapore, including for persons with special needs, who may have higher rates of co-occurring mental health conditions than the general population. For example, general practitioners are trained to diagnose and manage stable mental health conditions while psychiatrists and psychologists manage conditions that require more specialized management. Community outreach teams also reach out to individuals who are at risk of, and diagnosed with, mental health conditions, to provide support for these individuals in the community.More specific help is available to individuals with different sensory needs. For example, students with hearing impairments are assisted by school psychologists in their respective special schools to support their mental health needs.                                                Children with developmental and intellectual disabilities, including those with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), can access services by the Child Development Programme (CDP), where a multi-disciplinary team of healthcare professionals provide a holistic approach of assessment, diagnosis, and interim therapy, including attending to behavioural and mental health needs. The Institute of Mental Health (IMH) has also set up a Child Guidance Clinic (CGC) to provide professional services for children aged six to 18 years with developmental delay and/or intellectual disability with co-morbid mental health conditions. Adults with intellectual disability and/or ASD can also be referred to the Adult Neurodevelopmental Service (ANDS) at IMH, which carries out assessment and treatment of behavioural issues or co-existing mental health conditions in these individuals. MOH will continue to work with our healthcare providers and partners to ensure that every individual has access to quality mental health care, including for those who are differently-abled, and to ensure that the care and support is tailored to the unique needs of this group.                                       "
regulating or educating the public on digital marketing practices for unhealthy products such as junk food and e-cigarettes,Prof Lim Sun Sun asked the Minister for Health (a) whether there are plans to regulate the digital marketing of unhealthy products including junk food and e-cigarettes through online platforms that target youths; (b) whether the Ministry collects data on digital marketing of such products to different demographic groups; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider mounting public education campaigns to educate young consumers about such marketing strategies.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Regulations on the marketing of unhealthy products apply to both digital and non-digital media domains. For example, advertising and promotion of tobacco products such as e-cigarettes is prohibited, including through online platforms. On unhealthy food, marketing to children has been regulated via the Singapore Code of Advertising Practice, with additional Guidelines for Food Advertising to Children. In addition, the Ministry of Health announced in October 2019 that we will be introducing a product grading system for pre-packaged sugar-sweetened beverages, and will prohibit product advertisements for the least healthy ones on all local mass media platforms, including online channels. We will look into how we can monitor digital marketing more closely. We also agree with Prof Lim's suggestion to educate young consumers about marketing of unhealthy products, together with like-minded partners.            "
update on release of electoral boundaries review committee report,Mr Pritam Singh asked the Prime Minister (a) whether the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee (EBRC) has completed its deliberations; and (b) when will the EBRC report be released to the public.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing (for the Prime Minister): The Electoral Boundaries Review Committee (EBRC) has not completed its deliberations. When the EBRC has completed its work, the report will be presented to this House and released to the public."
tackling fault line formation from immigration and socio-economic status trends,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth what has and will the Government do to prevent (i) fault lines from class and immigration issues to develop (ii) erosion of our Singapore identity and (iii) gaps in the socio-economic status of Singaporeans.","Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: Since Independence, we have built a cohesive, fair and just society together. Diversity is a major feature of Singapore society, but we do not let our differences divide us. We have been proactive in our approach to social integration, especially in Singapore's multi-racial, multi-religious context. Our housing policy on ethnic integration and our national education system are examples of how we bring people together – regardless of their backgrounds – in public housing estates and schools. Our parks, libraries, hawker centres, sports facilities and museums are important common spaces open to all, so that Singaporeans from different walks of life mingle easily together. This is how we built a strong unifying Singapore identity, despite having the diversity that comes from being an immigrant nation. More recent immigrants to Singapore might differ from earlier immigrants in terms of education, skills or countries of origin, but by continuing to be open and inclusive, we can sustain the social harmony we enjoy today. By and large, Singaporeans value this approach. A recent Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) study showed that almost 90% of respondents felt they could learn a lot from foreign cultures and appreciated people of different nationalities living in the same neighbourhood. A previous IPS study also found that Singaporeans generally had diverse social ties across age, race and nationality in their personal social networks.  However, social cohesion and harmony is not something we should take for granted. Potential fault-lines arising from class and social inequality are a concern worldwide. In Singapore, our efforts to create jobs, raise incomes across the board, and lift up the least well-off in society have worked well for the vast majority of Singaporeans. Nevertheless, we remain vigilant as social mobility is slowing globally and mitigating the effects of social inequality never ends. Education and training are central pillars in the Government's effort to build a society of opportunities for all Singaporeans throughout their lives. The SkillsFuture movement and programmes like KidSTART are key in maintaining social mobility.  The work of social cohesion is not something that Government does, or can achieve, alone. Businesses, community organisations and individual Singaporeans have a part to play. Initiatives like UPLIFT work with community partners to strengthen support for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Our youths have been running ground-up projects to support disadvantaged groups. The SGCares movement and Our Singapore Fund promote whole-of-society activism by supporting ordinary Singaporeans with different ideas and talents to contribute to the common good. Similarly, to promote local-foreign understanding, the National Integration Council works with partners to carry out a wide variety of integration programmes. With the support of the People's Association and its grassroots network, the NIC also runs the Singapore Citizenship Journey and mobilises Integration and Naturalisation Champions to help induct new citizens into our society by helping them internalise our shared heritage, values and norms. Through the Community Integration Fund (CIF), the NIC supports ground-up projects that foster positive interactions and mutual understanding between locals and foreigners through community service, sports and cultural activities. By engaging each other face-to-face, and working side-by-side, we can ensure that Singapore society continues to stand strong and united."
sudden surge of workplace fatalities in november 2019,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Manpower on the sudden surge of workplace fatalities in November 2019 (a) what industries do these workers work in; (b) what are the reasons behind the spike in fatality numbers; and (c) what more is the Ministry doing to prevent such workplace fatalities.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: There were nine fatal workplace accidents in the month of November 2019, compared to an average of four per month in the past three years. The unusually high number of cases is a cause of concern for the Ministry. Therefore, we had probed deeper to uncover if there were any specific reasons or trends for the spate of accidents.  Of the nine fatalities, four were from the construction sector, two from marine, two from services, and one from manufacturing.  There was no dominant trend that contributed to the spate of accidents in November. Nonetheless, MOM, together with the industry partners, stepped up on engagement and enforcement efforts in November. We worked with the Singapore Contractors Association Ltd (SCAL) and the Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Council to organise an Industry Safety Timeout as a reminder to all contractors and workers to remain vigilant while at work. To send a strong signal to the industry, Minister of State Zaqy Mohamad led a team of enforcement officers on a surprise visit to a worksite, where the officers uncovered multiple WSH lapses. In response, we issued a full Stop Work Order. MOM's Stop Work Orders stay in force for a minimum of three weeks to ensure that the company's leadership appropriate actions to correct their safety practices and risk assessments. We expect companies to rectify all unsafe conditions and demonstrate to us their ability to better manage WSH on site before MOM lifts the Stop Work Order.  We will ramp up inspections by conducting 400 inspections until February 2020, targeting high-risk industries, such as construction, marine, as well as manufacturing. We will also conducted checks on similar equipment that were involved in two of the fatal accidents to prevent recurrence. These unfortunate accidents highlight the need for occupiers and employers to be more diligent in their risk management and mitigation, and not take WSH for granted.  Beyond the immediate-term engagement and enforcement efforts, we need longer-term measures to motivate more employers and occupiers to take greater ownership of risk awareness and mitigation. In 2020, we are progressively implementing the recommendations set out in the WSH 2028 Tripartite Strategies Committee report. They include publishing the safety performance of firms, and establishing a framework for public sector developers to disqualify unsafe contractors, including first-level sub-contractors. These moves will align businesses' commercial interests more closely to workplace safety. This will spur companies to be more serious in risk management and preventing accidents.                        "
impact of and preventive measures following incidents of personal data lost to hackers,"Mr Chong Kee Hiong asked the Minister for Communications and Information regarding incidents of personal data lost to hackers due to data privacy law breaches (a) what is the number of incidents in the public and private sectors respectively in each of the last three years; (b) what is the number of persons affected annually; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider implementing a registration and licensing scheme for software services providers, similar to the requirements imposed on accounting and legal firms, financial institutions and medical services providers.","Mr S Iswaran: The Personal Data Protection Commission (""PDPC"") investigated five cases in 2017, 13 cases in 2018 and 16 cases in 2019, involving private sector organisations due to hacking. In the public sector, four cases of data breaches due to hacking were reported in 2017 and three cases in 2018. No case was reported in 2019. These numbers include cases where malware was planted, and databases were held ransom or data was exfiltrated.Of these reported cases, in some instances completed investigations have demonstrated that personal data was exfiltrated due to hacking and breach of the PDPA. These affected 48,000 individuals in 2017 and 1.5 million individuals in 2018. The number for 2018 comprises primarily the data breach involving Singapore Health Services Pte Ltd and its data intermediary, Integrated Health Information Systems Pte Ltd. For similar cases involving the public sector, 35,000 individuals were affected in 2017, and 900 individuals were affected in 2018.   Under the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA), organisations are required to put in place security measures to safeguard the personal data in their possession or control. Data security requirements are also imposed on public agencies through the Public Sector (Governance) Act and the Government's Instruction Manual on ICT.Both private and public sector organisations have to fulfil their respective obligations regardless of whether they decide to outsource any functions to software services providers. If they do so, they should carry out due diligence to assess the capability, track record and suitability of software services providers.   The PDPA requires each private sector organisation to appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO) to ensure that the organisation complies with the PDPA. To better safeguard themselves against data breaches, organisations should firstly ensure that their DPOs are trained to develop and implement policies and practices for the organisations to meet their obligations under the PDPA. Secondly, they should register their DPOs with PDPC to keep abreast of relevant personal data protection developments. Thirdly, organisations can also apply for IMDA's Data Protection Trustmark, to verify that they conform to personal data protection standards and best practices.            "
help for mentally-distressed patients with occasional outbursts that target neighbours,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Health how does the Ministry help a mentally distressed patient whose condition is mild but who has occasional bouts of outbursts that target neighbours.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: MOH has worked with Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) to develop services to support persons with mental health conditions under the Community Mental Health Masterplan. For example, AIC acts as a ""first touchpoint"" for agencies, service providers and members of the public to refer persons suspected to have mental health condition(s) for further support. AIC with the support of relevant stakeholders could refer such persons to the appropriate medical and social services. In addition, AIC worked with community service providers to set up community outreach teams and community intervention teams. The community outreach teams educate residents on mental health conditions and, support persons with mental health conditions by providing basic emotional support, follow-up and service linkage to health and social services. As of March 2019, we have 41 community outreach teams which have reached out to over 234,000 people. The community intervention teams provide allied-health services such as performing mental health needs assessment and psychosocial therapeutic intervention for persons with mental health conditions. 21 community intervention teams have been developed and deployed as at March 2019. Persons with mental health conditions will benefit from having strong family and social support from an inclusive community besides receiving mental health treatments. For neighbour disputes, the Community Mediation Centre and Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals are platforms where various stakeholders can be engaged to find a resolution. If suspected mental health conditions are highlighted at these platforms, the persons could be referred to AIC for further support. AIC has supported and referred over 2,900 persons for health and/ or social services as of March 2019, of which some were involved in neighbour disputes. Such cases are generally challenging to address as the causes are usually multi-faceted and complex, and require multi-stakeholder support and involvement. Nonetheless, there have been cases where persons involved in disputes and, suspected to have mental health conditions, were successfully supported through multi-agency efforts between AIC, community mental health partners and healthcare institutions and other agencies such as the Singapore Police Force, Housing and Development Board and grassroots organisations. The government cannot address such issues, which are usually not just medical in nature but may also involve social issues, alone. Time and a whole of community effort is often required to address such issues for a more caring and inclusive society.  "
percentage of children who do not meet attendance requirement for basic and additional childcare subsidies,Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Social and Family Development with regard to basic and additional subsidies provided to families of Singapore citizen children enrolled in ECDA-licensed childcare centres (a) what is the current percentage of children who do not meet the 75% attendance requirement triggering the right on the part of Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) to effect a clawback of these subsidies; (b) what are the main reasons for the children being unable to meet the attendance requirements; and (c) what steps have or will be taken to address this issue.,"Mr Desmond Lee: To ensure affordable childcare for all families who need them, pre-school subsidies are provided for enrolled Singapore citizen children. The requirement is that they attend pre-school at least one day in the month, and not the 75% attendance rate as mentioned by the Member. The vast majority of children enrolled in pre-schools meet this very basic attendance requirement.Regular pre-school attendance is important so that the child can fully benefit from the pre-school experience. This goes beyond learning to read and write, and extends to other aspects of child development, such as social and emotional learning and motor skills development. Based on ECDA's interactions with preschools, reasons for low attendance are mostly non-financial in nature. Examples include parents' work arrangements, poor child health, lack of awareness on the importance of regular pre-school attendance, and competing priorities, such as the need to send multiple children to different schools. For children with low or irregular attendance, pre-schools are strongly encouraged to engage the parents to understand the family's circumstances, and where needed, refer them to Family Service Centres and Social Service Offices which can assist the families who may benefit from social services support. Under KidSTART, selected pre-schools are supported with additional resources to help children from lower-income families address barriers to pre-school attendance and their overall socio-developmental needs. KidSTART currently supports 1,000 children across all KidSTART programmes, and will expand to reach another 5,000 children over the next three years."
efforts to promote financial literacy among students,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Education what are the efforts to promote financial literacy among school students, particularly in respect of the choices they will need to make later in life that impinge on retirement adequacy.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: MOE recognises the importance of financial literacy education for our students, and works with MoneySense to deliver it in the following ways: In Primary schools, financial literacy education is anchored on the teaching of core moral values. Students are taught basic concepts and values such as delayed gratification, differentiating between needs and wants, spending within our means, thrift and savings. These are delivered through the Form Teacher Guidance Period and Character and Citizenship Education lessons.In Secondary schools, students learn about simple financial planning, the responsible use of credit, and are equipped with knowledge of consumer rights, in order to become responsible and discerning consumers.At the Pre-university level, financial literacy is infused in A-Level Economics. Students learn how to weigh costs and benefits, and consider constraints and perspectives in making well-informed decisions. Pre-university students can also access a financial education module through MOE's online learning platform, Student Learning Space, under Character and Citizenship Education.At the Polytechnics and Institute of Technical Education, all Year 1 students will undergo a mandatory financial education module to equip them with basic financial knowledge and practical tools, and cultivate good financial habits. Students learn about key financial concepts such as budgeting and compound interest, and acquire a basic understanding of national schemes, such as the Central Provident Fund, and how it can be used to meet their housing, healthcare and retirement adequacy needs.Similarly, at the Autonomous Universities, financial education is available through course modules in finance and investment, as well as various campus activities, workshops and talks which build awareness of good money management and financial planning before they enter the workplace.        "
adoption of prefabricated prefinished volumetric construction (ppvc) method of construction in singapore,"Dr Teo Ho Pin asked the Minister for National Development (a) to date, how many projects have adopted the Prefabricated Prefinished Volumetric Construction (PPVC) method of construction; and (b) what is the amount of Government grants that have been disbursed to support PPVC-related firms and projects since its implementation; and (c) what are the challenges faced when adopting PPVC.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Since 2013, more than 50 public and private sector projects have adopted the Prefabricated Prefinished Volumetric Construction (PPVC) method of construction. We have taken a multi-pronged approach to promote the adoption of productive construction methods like PPVC. The intent is to help lower the cost premium of adopting such technologies in the long-term.First, we have generated lead demand by stipulating productivity conditions as requirements for selected Government Land Sales sites, and requiring public sector projects to adopt productive construction methods, such as PPVC. Second, we have provided incentives to help defray the higher cost of PPVC adoption and build industry capabilities. The Productivity Innovation Project (PIP) scheme, which funds up to 70% of the qualifying cost for innovative technologies, is one such initiative. To date, nine firms have tapped on the PIP scheme to support PPVC-related projects, with more than $15 million disbursed. We have also provided $5 million for PPVC-related training. Third, we have built up our supply base to increase our local production capability. We have 32 approved PPVC suppliers now, as compared to three suppliers six years ago.   Fourth, we have built industry capabilities in PPVC adoption. This is a joint effort with the industry and the institutes of higher learning, led by the iBuildSG Tripartite Committee. Besides training, BCA also conducts regular workshops, seminars and site visits and publishes guides on PPVC adoption for the industry.  "
additional ballot chances for new flats for those who wish to buy a flat near their parents but failed in previous attempts,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development for those who wish to purchase a HDB flat and live near their parents in mature estates, whether HDB will review and consider granting additional ballot chances to these applicants for each failed attempt in securing their flats from Built-To-Order (BTO)/Sale of Balance Flats (SBF)/Re-offer of Balance Flats (ROF) exercises.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Families who wish to buy a new HDB flat to live with or near their parents already enjoy priority in their flat application under the Married Child Priority Scheme and the Multi-Generation Priority Scheme. This includes those who wish to buy flats in the mature estates.Flats in the mature estates tend to be more popular and limited in supply. Flats in the Sale of Balance Flats and Re-offer of Balance Flats exercises are similarly limited. Hence, we are unable to extend additional ballot chances to families who apply for these flats.  Besides new flats, families who wish to live with or near their parents may also buy a resale flat and qualify for the Proximity Housing Grant of up to $30,000."
number of malaysians working in singapore on work permits and sectors they work in,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how many Malaysian workers are working in Singapore on work permits annually over the past five years; (b) which are the three main sectors that they are working in; and (c) what proportion of these Malaysian workers do not live in Singapore but instead commute between Singapore and Malaysia on a daily basis.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: MOM publishes annual statistics on local and foreign workforce numbers. However, MOM does not provide a breakdown of the number of foreign workers by nationality as it is not in Singapore's interest to do so. Malaysian workers can be found across all sectors. This is not surprising, since our work pass framework allows Malaysian workers in all sectors, subject to the respective sector's Dependency Ratio Ceiling (DRC) controls.                        "
local companies that list outside of singapore,"Mr Ang Wei Neng asked the Prime Minister (a) how many Singapore companies have chosen to be listed on stock exchanges outside of the Singapore Exchange (SGX) in the past 10 years; (b) how many companies have (i) listed and (ii) de-listed from the SGX in the past 10 years, broken down by Singapore and foreign companies; and (c) what are the strategies to encourage more companies, local and foreign, to be listed on the SGX.","Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): Mr Ang's question is about the prospects and strategies of SGX. We are in a leading position in the trading of Asian equity and commodity derivatives, foreign exchange and fixed income. In cash equities, SGX remains one of the most international exchanges globally with overseas companies making up 43% of total market capitalisation. SGX is also the largest and most international Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) market in Asia ex-Japan, with REITs from US, Europe listed on its mainboard.However, Singapore's cash equities market has not grown as fast as the derivatives and REITs markets. Wider trends play a big part. Globally, Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) fell 20% to a three-year low, and number of IPOs in Asia hit a five year low1. This is because companies are staying private for longer2, as they have alternative sources to fund growth and expansion.At the same time, more companies are delisting from public equity markets. In the US, for instance, for the first time since 2006-2007, the value of listed companies going private in 2018 exceeded the value of private companies going public, causing a net outflow from the US public markets. Specific to Mr Ang's questions, from 2009-2019, 279 new companies listed on SGX, of which 60% are Singapore companies. However, over the same period, we saw 302 delistings of both Singapore and foreign companies. Unfortunately, there are no ready statistics available to Mr Ang's specific question on the number of Singapore companies listed overseas.SGX is taking a number of initiatives to encourage more equity listings. There is no silver bullet solution, and SGX will need to undertake a multi-prong approach over a period of time to re-invigorate the local equity market. The key measures are:First, increase the number of market makers and liquidity providers to enhance market liquidity, and admit new Mainboard issue managers and Catalist sponsors3.Second, develop cross-border partnerships and expand SGX's global footprint. SGX has partnered Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and Nasdaq to boost capital raising opportunities for technology companies. These partnerships have generated a healthy pipeline of companies looking to secondary list on SGX.Third, SGX has introduced the Dual Class Share structure to enhance Singapore's value proposition as a listing destination for new high-growth technology companies.Fourth, work with private market platforms to build the IPO pipeline. Such platforms can provide growth companies access to a wide network of investors for financing needs just prior to IPO.Finally, step up investor outreach efforts to generate investment ideas and interest.MAS supports SGX's efforts. It has launched the S$75 million Grant for Equity Market Singapore or GEMS, in February last year. MAS will co-fund the listing expenses of companies in high-growth and technology sectors as well provide grants to widen the research coverage of SGX listed stocks, especially of small and mid-cap companies. Since the grant inception, MAS has approved seven listing grant applications. Research houses tapping on GEMS have committed to hiring close to 50 fresh graduates and experienced research analysts over the next three years."
success rate of debt recovery by official assignee over past 10 years,Mr Seah Kian Peng asked the Minister for Law (a) whether he can provide an update on the success rate of debt recovery by the Official Assignee over the last 10 years; and (b) what has been the Official Assignee's track record in recovery of overseas assets held by insolvent persons.,"Mr K Shanmugam: Bankruptcy refers to the legal process whereby the debts that a person who is unable to pay are resolved. It provides an orderly regime for the resolution of unpaid debts, and seeks to balance the interests of debtors, creditors and the wider society, by: (a) Ensuring that bankrupts are held accountable for their debts, but allowing them to make a fresh start in their financial matters after a period of time; and (b) Providing incentives for creditors not to over-extend credit and for debtors to not borrow more than they can repay.Under the bankruptcy regime, the Official Assignee, or OA, serves as the trustee of the estate of bankrupt individuals, assisted by the Insolvency Office. One of the duties of the OA is to investigate the affairs of the bankrupt, and thereafter to recover and realise his assets for distribution to the bankrupt's creditors. The debt recovery rate is the ratio of the total dividends paid to creditors over the total debts owed, and depends on the bankrupt's ability to pay. In general, bankrupt individuals have limited ability to pay their debt. Hence, the OA will make reasonable efforts to realise assets for creditors as long as it is financially viable to do so. The OA has to exercise prudence as any cost incurred by the OA is paid out of the bankruptcy estate or the public purse for shortfall. The debt recovery rate for bankruptcy cases averaged 4% over the last 10 years.Less than 1% of bankruptcy cases administered by the OA involve overseas assets. For such cases, the OA will adopt a pragmatic approach in deciding whether to embark on recovery work, as this can be resource-intensive and often have little or no likelihood of success. In general, the OA will only proceed in attempting to recover the assets if information provided about the assets is complete and not speculative. If creditors prefer, they may also choose to appoint a Private Trustee-in-Bankruptcy to carry out the recovery and realisation of assets.In 2009, the Ministry introduced the Debt Repayment Scheme, which is a pre-bankruptcy scheme, to provide an alternative approach for debtors to pay off all or some of his debt through a repayment plan over a period of time. Debtors with a regular income and whose unsecured debt do not exceed $100,000 can be considered for the scheme. The scheme benefits both the debtors, who can avoid bankruptcy if he meets his obligations under the Scheme, and the creditors, who will receive no less than what they would have otherwise received had the debtor gone into bankruptcy. Around 30% of debtors in bankruptcy proceedings are referred to the DRS. The recovery rate has averaged 85% since the scheme’s commencement. While the OA will make reasonable efforts to help creditors recover debt, the amount recovered depends on how much the bankrupt is able to pay, and it is necessary to balance the creditor's interest against allowing bankrupts to make a fresh start in their financial affairs. On this note, we encourage lenders to exercise prudence in extending credit.            "
number of misleading food labels detected in past three years and measures to ensure compliance with food labelling requirements,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what is the number of misleading food labels detected in the past three years; (b) what actions have been taken against the respective food manufacturers or importers; (c) what is the percentage of food products that the Singapore Food Agency conducts random checks on each year; and (d) what more can the Ministry do to ensure food products comply with food labelling requirements.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) conducts regular food safety inspections to ensure that food sold in Singapore complies with our food safety standards and requirements. On average, 60,000 of such inspections are carried out in a year. As part of SFA's inspection regime, SFA also carries out random sampling and laboratory testing of pre-packed food for sale in Singapore to ensure that they are accurately labelled with the name of food, ingredients, net content and source. This information is important for tracing and recall, in the event of food safety concerns, such as food contamination and allergens. Proper food labelling also helps consumers make informed food choices at the point of purchase. Food manufacturers and traders must ensure that the naming of food products adhere to food labelling requirements. Companies that do not comply will be subjected to enforcement action.Over the past three years,1 SFA has detected a total of 260 cases involving misleading food labels from its regular inspections and investigations into public feedback on possible mislabelling. Enforcement action taken against offenders include the issuance of warning letters and composition fines. To promote the understanding of food labelling requirements, SFA has worked with our Polytechnics to provide courses and consultancy on food labelling to the industry and public. For example, SFA has collaborated with Singapore Polytechnic on the ""WSQ Follow Good Food Labelling Practices"" course, which the industry and members of the public can attend. In addition, SFA conducts outreach programmes on food labelling in partnership with industry associations, such as the Singapore Food Manufacturers' Association. Information on food labels is also available via SFA's website.  The assurance of food safety and quality is a joint responsibility. While SFA will continue to be vigilant and ensure that regulatory measures are in place and properly enforced, the industry is responsible for adhering to food labelling requirements, and consumers should exercise discretion when choosing food products based on the information provided on the label. Members of public who have queries on food labels may also contact the relevant companies for more information.                          "
appeals by singaporean adult children to waive cpf repayment when they withdraw their names from flats co-owned with parents,"Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar asked the Minister for Manpower (a) over the last five years, how many appeals have been made each year by Singaporean adult children to waive the CPF repayment by their parents when they withdraw their names from the flat co-owned with their parents; (b) how many of these appeals have been rejected; and (c) whether CPF Board will consider reviewing this policy to allow flexibility for the Singaporean adult children to exercise options that allow waiver of full lump sum repayment by their parents.","Mrs Josephine Teo: To ensure members' retirement adequacy is not compromised, CPF savings used for the flat, including the interest that would have been accrued had the monies not been withdrawn, should be refunded to their CPF accounts upon the sale of the flat. This applies when a CPF member who co-owns a flat with his parent withdraws his name from the flat, as the transaction is akin to a sale. We recognise that many members initiate such ownership transfers as they are planning to purchase a matrimonial HDB flat. For such cases, allowance is given for the member to transfer ownership and make the required CPF refund six months after he has taken possession of his new flat. This transition period could stretch to a few years if the member is buying a Build-To-Order flat. Similar to flat purchases, the refund can be made using the parents' CPF savings, or by taking up a HDB or bank loan if eligible. The monies refunded to the member's account can also be used to pay for the new matrimonial flat. Over the last five years, CPF Board has received around 200 appeals annually on average to waive the CPF refunds, upon transfer of flat ownership. For members who are unable to make the CPF refund in time, CPF Board and HDB will work with them to explore their options, which will depend on the specific circumstances of their family. For example, they may have a sibling who can take over their share of the co-owned flat, or their parents may wish to right-size to a smaller flat that is within their budget.                                 "
reasons for massive traffic jams at 2019 standard chartered singapore marathon and preventive measures,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth with regard to the massive traffic jams caused during the 2019 Standard Chartered Singapore Marathon held from 29 November to 1 December 2019 (a) on what grounds have the road closure and diversion plans been approved; (b) whether consideration has been given to the three other major events happening downtown that weekend; and (c) how does the Ministry intend to review and enhance regulations and requirements for such future events.","27 Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) whether the Ministry has conducted a comparative review of the issues and disruptions that arose from the Standard Chartered Singapore Marathon (SCSM) 2019 held from 29 November to 1 December 2019 in the evening for the first time, against previous years; (b) what are the learning points; (c) whether the Ministry anticipates any inconvenience to individuals near the SCSM 2020 event venue; and (d) whether any changes will be introduced to SCSM 2020 and similar events to mitigate the problems caused by SCSM 2019. 28 Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) what are the reasons for the massive jams during the 2019 Standard Chartered Singapore Marathon; (b) why has this situation not been anticipated; (c) what are the lessons learned; and (d) how can such massive jams be avoided in future large scale events such as marathons. 29 Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth in light of the severe congestion caused by a recently held marathon (a) how does the Ministry balance the supporting of major sporting events and inconvenience to road users; (b) how can commercial organisers be made liable to mitigate against severe congestion; and (c) whether organisers who fail to address road congestion issues previously be prevented from running similar events in future.Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: The Standard Chartered Singapore Marathon (SCSM) is the most anticipated race on Singapore's running calendar and last year marked SCSM's 18th edition. In order to create more conducive running conditions and a better race experience for participants, as well as bring more spectators out into the streets to enjoy the race, the SCSM was organised as an evening race for the first time on Saturday, 30 November 2019. There was a marked increase in the number of participants and spectators, with nearly 30,000 participants running in the marathon and half-marathon events, and more than 70,000 supporters cheering on the runners at the designated spectator zones and along the route.  MCCY and SportSG supported this event as an opportunity to enhance the significance of the event for Singapore from a social, sporting and economic perspective. We aspire to showcase Singapore's vibrancy and character to the world through SCSM as a World Marathon Majors event, alongside the iconic marathons held in Berlin, Boston, Chicago, London, New York and Tokyo. In Singapore, our runners participate in the SCSM to celebrate their resilience and purpose. There is a growing number championing worthwhile causes, such as those helping to raise awareness and funds for people with Parkinson's and the disadvantaged in society. We would like to embrace a spirit of care, inclusion and resilience in our society by encouraging more Singaporeans to be a part of this year-end event.  From the onset, SportSG and the organisers Ironman Asia recognised that the evening timing would be a complex and major undertaking and took the preparations seriously. Preparations for the SCSM 2019 began shortly after the conclusion of the 2018 event. A joint operations committee involving the organisers and various Government agencies, such as LTA and the Traffic Police, was set up to develop and implement traffic plans and minimise inconvenience to the public. A detailed traffic impact study was conducted, and plans took into careful account accessibility for essential services such as hospitals and fire stations. Additional traffic measures were put in place in view of major concurrent events such as the U2 Concert at the Singapore Sports Hub and the Christmas Wonderland at Gardens by the Bay. SportSG also coordinated with the Singapore Tourism Board to engage affected businesses and stakeholders since the start of 2019, where road closure information was shared early with over 150 affected stakeholders to help with their own preparations.  In the weeks leading up to the race, the event organiser ramped up road closure announcements on mainstream and social media platforms. It also beefed up call centre operations to address public queries on the road closures. On event day, 500 Auxiliary Police Officers were deployed at critical road junctions to redirect motorists and advise on alternative routes. Emergency services were facilitated through regardless of the road closures. Roads were progressively opened as the race proceeded, in as safe a manner as possible.MCCY takes the public feedback seriously. We will work with the event organiser and relevant agencies to study these points, including suggestions to de-conflict the SCSM with other major events, and the need to enhance public communications on the road closures. Given the scale of the Singapore Marathon and our ambition for it to be amongst the World Marathon Majors, we recognise that the logistics will pose inconvenience to stakeholders and members of the public in the initial years, and we will keep aiming to improve how future editions are organised. But we hope that with the support of Singaporeans and by working closely with partners, we can build up the SCSM into an event that all Singaporeans can be proud of and look forward to. "
rates of obesity in children and the elderly,"Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked the Minister for Health (a) whether he can provide an update on the current rates of obesity in children, adults and the elderly respectively; (b) how do these figures compare with those of previous years; and (c) what has been the progress and effectiveness of measures to reduce obesity among Singaporeans.","Mr Gan Kim Yong:  Based on the 2017 National Population Health Survey, the prevalence of obesity1 among adult Singaporeans aged 18 to 59 years was 8.9%, and that among seniors aged 60 to 74 years was 6.9%. This has remained stable since 2013. The proportion of overweight2 children in our mainstream schools, aged six to 18 years, has increased from 11% in 2013 to 13% in 20173. MOH and HPB work with other Government agencies to combat obesity through the promotion of physical activity and better diets, such as eating more healthily and reducing daily sugar consumption. This is also in line with our overall strategy in Singapore's War on Diabetes.To promote healthier diets, HPB has introduced programmes such as the Healthier Choice Symbol (HCS) and Healthier Dining Programme (HDP) to increase the availability of healthier options, as well as campaigns such as the Eat, Drink, Shop Healthy Challenge to incentivise healthier purchases. To further create a healthy food environment, HDB and HPB collaborated to include the provision of healthy meals as a consideration in Price-Quality tenders for new eating houses, awarding more points for tenderers that offer healthy meal options. In partnership with MOE and ECDA, HPB has also implemented healthy meals programmes4 in all mainstream schools and eight in 10 preschools, to inculcate healthy eating habits from young. These efforts are complemented by health education outreach in schools in partnership with stakeholders such as South-West Community Development Council, Sengkang General Hospital, and National Youth Achievement Award (NYAA) Council; and at workplaces where HPB works with industry partners to roll out relevant workplace health promotion programmes such as workshops and health coaching.These programmes have contributed to better diets. From the National Nutrition Survey 2018, Singaporeans are consuming fewer calories, better-quality carbohydrates consisting more wholegrain, fruits and vegetables, as well as substituting saturated fat with unsaturated fat. However, our sugar intake remains high at 60g per person per day. As such, we will be introducing new regulatory measures for pre-packaged sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), namely nutrition labelling and advertising prohibitions for less healthy SSBs. To encourage exercise, HPB, SportSG, and People's Association offer a wide range of physical activity programmes and sport facilities island-wide. MOE also makes facilities and sports equipment available beyond the formal curriculum time to encourage better utilisation. There are targeted programmes, such as those that cater to at-risk Professional, Managers, Executives and Technicians (PMET) at the workplace to increase the adoption of a more active lifestyle. For seniors, Active Ageing Programmes (AAPs) are also made available at over 600 locations island-wide where the elderly can participate in group exercises and health workshops.Recognising how our living environment can influence behaviours, our infrastructure agencies such as MND, MOT and others have strived to build a city that encourages active lifestyles and mobility. This includes more than 350 parks and gardens, 200km of covered link-ways, and 440km of cycling paths and park connectors; and there are plans to further enhance the living environment to support a more physically active citizenry. All these efforts have led to encouraging results – 80.9% of Singaporeans had sufficient total physical activity in 2017, up from 73.1% in 2013.Reducing obesity in our population requires coordinated and continuous efforts from all relevant stakeholders. In the long term, such efforts may also lead to a reduction in the prevalence of chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension and their accompanying complications. MOH will continue to monitor the trends in obesity, physical activity, and nutritional habits of Singaporeans, and work with the other Government agencies and the wider society to tackle this issue.              "
prevalence of dementia in singapore in past five years and distinguishing dementia from other mental health issues,Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the prevalence and incidence of dementia in Singapore over the past five years; (b) whether our health services are adequately resourced to manage dementia patients given our ageing population; and (c) what has been the progress in the establishment of dementia-friendly communities.,"31 Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Health (a) what lessons are learnt from the implementation of the Community Mental Health Masterplan (CMHM) and National Mental Health Blueprint (NMHB); (b) whether these lessons will influence the next CMHM and NMHB; (c) whether the Ministry will consider running public consultations for these plans; and (d) whether the Ministry will consider distinguishing dementia from mental health conditions under the plans, since they each require different strategies, treatment and support to be dealt with. Mr Gan Kim Yong: In 2007, MOH implemented the National Mental Health Blueprint to improve early detection and treatment for persons with mental health conditions. Subsequently, the Community Mental Health (CMH) Masterplan was launched in 2012 to place more focus on mental health care in the community for persons to receive care closer to home. Through these plans, MOH has increased accessibility and capacity of mental health services in the healthcare institutions and community, facilitated early identification and access to interventions. For example, the Agency for Integrated Care has worked with community service providers to set up 41 community outreach teams to educate the public on mental health conditions and dementia, and refer those with such conditions to the appropriate health and/ or social services. We have also increased access to mental health and/ or dementia services in 12 polyclinics.  According to the Well-being of the Singapore Elderly (WiSE) study 2013, one in 10 seniors aged 60 years and above is estimated to have dementia. We recognise that there are differences in the needs of persons with mental health conditions, such as depression and anxiety, and those with dementia. However, the broad approach is similar, that is to increase access to appropriate care, through early identification, build capabilities and capacity in the community to identify and treat such conditions. With this approach, we have strengthened dementia services in the community. For example, we have established eight Dementia-Friendly Communities (DFCs), to create an inclusive society for persons with dementia and their care-givers. These are neighbourhoods which are equipped to better support persons with dementia and their care-givers to continue living well at home, where residents, grassroots leaders, businesses and the community are trained to recognise dementia signs and symptoms. We are on track to expand the number of DFCs to 15 by 2021.In addition, MOH has more than tripled the number of Dementia Day Care places since 2015. These Day Care Centres can serve up to 3,400 persons with dementia each day. Working care-givers, in particular, can have peace of mind, knowing that their loved ones are well-cared for in the day.MOH has also increased dementia capability and capacity in the acute hospitals. We have piloted new specific inpatient dementia services in three acute hospitals (Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, Changi General Hospital and Institute of Mental Health) and two Community Hospitals (St Luke's Hospital and Saint Andrew's Community Hospital), to cater to patients of varying severity. We are now working to expand such inpatient dementia services to more hospitals to strengthen hospitals' capabilities in inpatient dementia care. Since 2012, we have also grown outpatient Memory Clinic capacity in our acute hospitals, to ensure that persons with dementia have access to early outpatient assessment, detection, multi-disciplinary intervention and care-giver support. For long-term care, new nursing homes developed by MOH are designed with dementia-friendly features to cater to the needs of persons with dementia. We are currently adopting a whole-of-Government approach to review the overall strategy on mental health together with other ministries and stakeholders, and will also consider consultation with relevant stakeholders. The review will take into account learnings from the implementation of our existing mental health plans, such as recruiting more mental health service providers and addressing mental health stigma, to improve awareness of mental well-being and strengthen access to mental health support.                "
collaboration amongst government agencies to test and share new technologies,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Prime Minister (a) how are the different Ministries and agencies collaborating to test and share new technologies; and (b) what are the platforms available for agencies to check on new technologies being piloted to accelerate our collective learning and adoption capabilities.,"Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): Ministries and agencies collaborate to test, share and deploy technologies in three ways.First, we do so by taking a citizen-centric approach, so that technology solutions work across agency boundaries to serve citizens well and solve their problems. For example, under the ""Moments of Life"" initiative, a common platform bundles Government digital services from multiple agencies so that citizens need to transact only through one channel rather than with many different agencies. Second, we build horizontal platforms to share technology resources. The Science & Tech Policy and Planning Office (S&TPPO) is looking at creating a drones-as-a-service platform, for applications like aerial mapping and facade inspection. The Smart Nation and Digital Government Group (SNDGG) is developing the Government Technology Stack and Government Data Architecture, to share software services and data safely and efficiently across agencies. SingPass, for instance, is used by all agencies to transact securely with citizens. SingPass is also being used by businesses, such as NTUC Income and AIA, to allow customers to access their digital services.Third, we pool in-house technical capabilities to serve whole-of-government needs. Centres of Excellence or CentExes have been set up in various engineering fields, to pool expertise within the Government, and build them up in numbers and quality. For example, GovTech serves as the CentEx for Info-communications Technology and Smart Systems; and JTC serves as the CentEx for Building and Infrastructure.CentExes play a functional leadership role in their respective domains. Besides supporting other agencies' engineering needs, they lift engineering standards and disseminate best practices across the public service by a common process of masterplanning, competency and training frameworks. The Public Service Division and S&TPPO also supports learning among agencies, through the organisation of learning circles and capability building workshops.Beyond in-house capabilities, the public sector also makes use of various platforms to learn from and partner the industry and research community. IMDA's Open Innovation Platform matches problem owners, from both public and private sectors, with problem solvers from industry and the research ecosystem. A*STAR's National Robotics Programme forges public-private partnerships to undertake R&D to use robotics to address various public sector challenges.The public sector will continue to work collectively to make the best use of technology to serve citizens and businesses, and improve the quality of city living. We will also work closely with companies and researchers, so that as a nation, we may overcome our natural constraints and raise our economic competitiveness through technological innovation."
pre-schools offering inclusive education for special needs children,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) how many pre-schools currently offer inclusive education for special needs children; (b) whether the current capacity is sufficient to meet demand; and (c) what is the support given to schools to adopt an inclusive model.,"Mr Desmond Lee: Inclusive preschools strive to provide children with developmental needs the opportunity to enrol in pre-schools alongside their typically-developing peers. Today, many preschools already strive to adopt a more inclusive approach and enrol children with mild to moderate developmental needs. To support this inclusion within pre-schools, the Government funds the provision of the Learning Support (LS), Development Support (DS) and Development Support Plus (DS-Plus) programmes. Under these programmes, professionals, such as Learning Support Educators, Early Intervention teachers, therapists and psychologists, provide intervention for children with developmental needs in their pre-schools once or twice a week. They also guide pre-school teachers in adapting their teaching methods and activities, to better engage and integrate these children in the classroom setting.The DS and LS programmes are currently offered at about 550 pre-schools. ECDA is working with sector partners to increase the number of pre-schools that offer DS and LS. The DS-Plus programme was launched in July 2019 to offer more intensive support and will be rolled out to more preschools over time. With the extension of DS-LS and DS-Plus programmes to more pre-schools, we would be able to offer families more timely and accessible support.Currently, the majority of children with moderate to severe developmental needs attend both the Early Intervention Programme for Infants and Children (EIPIC) and pre-schools to ensure that their needs are holistically met. A small number of pre-schools, such as Kindle Garden and Canossaville Pre-school, cater to these children in an inclusive setting. MSF has set up an Inclusive Pre-school Workgroup (IPWG) involving people, private and public sector partners, to learn from the experiences of local and international inclusive pre-schools. The IPWG will develop recommendations on how to better support children with moderate to severe developmental needs within pre-schools.To support pre-school teachers, the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) works with the National Institute of Early Childhood Development (NIEC) and other training institutes to equip them with the skills to support children with developmental needs within an inclusive environment. In pre-service training, early childhood teachers are taught the basics of identifying and working with children with developmental needs, including where to get additional support if needed. In-service teachers can also tap on subsidised post-diploma training and Continuing Professional Development (CPD) courses to deepen their knowledge and skills in this area. NIEC also offers the Specialist Diploma in Early Childhood Learning Support (SDELS) and the Advanced Diploma in Early Childhood Intervention (Special Needs) (ADESN) to equip those who wish to take on specialist roles as Learning Support Educators and Early Intervention teachers respectively to support children with developmental needs. "
review of grab's upfront cash programme offered to delivery riders,Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for Law (a) whether the Ministry will review Grab's Upfront Cash Programme offered to their delivery riders to determine whether the administrative charges are reasonable; and (b) how do the charges compare to rates offered by moneylenders and banks for unsecured lending.,"Mr K Shanmugam: Grab's Upfront Cash Programme has been brought to the attention of the Ministry of Law. We are engaging Grab to find out more about this programme. Let me provide a brief description of the UCP based on what we have gathered from Grab. The UCP is a programme offered to selected Grab's third party service providers, which include GrabCar and GrabTaxi drivers and delivery partners. These service providers derive their income from two sources. First, they earn fees paid directly by users. Second, Grab pays out incentives when they complete certain requirements. For example, a delivery partner may earn an incentive upon completing a certain number of trips within a stipulated time period. Under the UCP, such a selected delivery partner can request to receive their incentive payments in advance, before completing the requirements. If Grab accedes to such requests, it charges the delivery partner an upfront administrative fee before disbursing the balance incentive payment. The Member asked how the charges for Grab's UCP compares. As there are differences in the features, terms and conditions of various products, we would like to caution against making direct comparisons. Nevertheless, let me share briefly the rates offered by Grab. According to Grab, the administrative fee ranges from 5% to 10% of the advance incentive payments granted, and no further fees or interest charges are imposed. Under the regulatory framework for moneylending, licensed moneylenders are permitted to charge an upfront administrative fee of not more than 10% of the loan principal, as well as a nominal interest of up to 4% per month and other prescribed fees. Banks offer a wide range of credit products and charges vary, according to the tenor, risk and other features of the product concerned.We will study further with Grab before assessing what measures need to be taken. We strongly encourage individuals to review the terms of the UCP carefully and assess their ability to complete the requirements and meet the financial commitments before participating in the programme.       "
quality and unique mental health care and support for differently-abled individuals,"Ms Yip Pin Xiu asked the Minister for Health what are the measures to ensure that differently-abled individuals such as individuals who are deaf, mute or autistic receive quality mental health care and support that meet their unique needs.","Mr Gan Kim Yong:  Persons with different abilities are handled by various groups of healthcare professionals in the public healthcare system. Efforts have been made to facilitate early detection and referral for management of mental health conditions for all individuals in Singapore, including for persons with special needs, who may have higher rates of co-occurring mental health conditions than the general population. For example, general practitioners are trained to diagnose and manage stable mental health conditions while psychiatrists and psychologists manage conditions that require more specialized management. Community outreach teams also reach out to individuals who are at risk of, and diagnosed with, mental health conditions, to provide support for these individuals in the community.More specific help is available to individuals with different sensory needs. For example, students with hearing impairments are assisted by school psychologists in their respective special schools to support their mental health needs.                                                Children with developmental and intellectual disabilities, including those with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), can access services by the Child Development Programme (CDP), where a multi-disciplinary team of healthcare professionals provide a holistic approach of assessment, diagnosis, and interim therapy, including attending to behavioural and mental health needs. The Institute of Mental Health (IMH) has also set up a Child Guidance Clinic (CGC) to provide professional services for children aged six to 18 years with developmental delay and/or intellectual disability with co-morbid mental health conditions. Adults with intellectual disability and/or ASD can also be referred to the Adult Neurodevelopmental Service (ANDS) at IMH, which carries out assessment and treatment of behavioural issues or co-existing mental health conditions in these individuals. MOH will continue to work with our healthcare providers and partners to ensure that every individual has access to quality mental health care, including for those who are differently-abled, and to ensure that the care and support is tailored to the unique needs of this group.

regulating or educating the public on digital marketing practices for unhealthy products such as junk food and e-cigarettes,Prof Lim Sun Sun asked the Minister for Health (a) whether there are plans to regulate the digital marketing of unhealthy products including junk food and e-cigarettes through online platforms that target youths; (b) whether the Ministry collects data on digital marketing of such products to different demographic groups; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider mounting public education campaigns to educate young consumers about such marketing strategies.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Regulations on the marketing of unhealthy products apply to both digital and non-digital media domains. For example, advertising and promotion of tobacco products such as e-cigarettes is prohibited, including through online platforms. On unhealthy food, marketing to children has been regulated via the Singapore Code of Advertising Practice, with additional Guidelines for Food Advertising to Children. In addition, the Ministry of Health announced in October 2019 that we will be introducing a product grading system for pre-packaged sugar-sweetened beverages, and will prohibit product advertisements for the least healthy ones on all local mass media platforms, including online channels. We will look into how we can monitor digital marketing more closely. We also agree with Prof Lim's suggestion to educate young consumers about marketing of unhealthy products, together with like-minded partners.            "
update on release of electoral boundaries review committee report,Mr Pritam Singh asked the Prime Minister (a) whether the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee (EBRC) has completed its deliberations; and (b) when will the EBRC report be released to the public.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing (for the Prime Minister): The Electoral Boundaries Review Committee (EBRC) has not completed its deliberations. When the EBRC has completed its work, the report will be presented to this House and released to the public."
effectiveness of community disputes resolution tribunal,Mr Seah Kian Peng asked the Minister for Law whether the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunal (CDRT) has been effective since its formation and what steps can be taken to improve its processes to make it more expedient and to produce outcomes that can be more effectively enforced.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals (CDRT) were established on 1 October 2015. The CDRT is an avenue to a variety of remedies for persons whose enjoyment or use of their place of residence has been unreasonably interfered with by their neighbours.The CDRT was established as an alternative to other avenues of recourse for disputing neighbours. These other avenues include: (a) recourse under the criminal law such as filing a Magistrate's Complaint for offences under the Protection from Harassment Act or Penal Code; (b) obtaining private law remedies, such as injunctions or damages, through the tort of private nuisance or applying for a Protection Order; and (c) mediation.The CDRT processes are designed to be efficient and accessible. It costs $150 to file a claim before the CDRT. Simplified procedures are used. Proceedings employ a judge-led approach and representation by lawyers is generally disallowed.Between 1 October 2015 and 30 September 2019, 349 claims were filed in the CDRT. Three hundred and nineteen claims were disposed of by the CDRT within this period. Two hundred and thirty- five of these claims were resolved amicably – these comprised 167 claims which were withdrawn/discontinued, and 68 claims where Consent Orders were granted. As for the remaining 84 claims that were disposed of, these comprised 38 claims where the CDRT granted orders after trial and 46 claims where the CDRT dismissed/struck off the applications.CDRT orders – like any other court orders – are to be taken seriously. If a party does not comply with a CDRT order, the CDRT may issue a Special Direction for the offending party to comply with the order within a specified time. A person who does not comply with a Special Direction commits a criminal offence punishable with a fine of up to $5,000, a term of imprisonment of up to three months, or both. Non-compliance can also result in a court order excluding the offending party from his or her place of residence. These are very serious consequences, and rightly so. From 1 October 2015 to 30 September 2019, a total of 15 Special Directions were issued. We continue to monitor the effectiveness of the CDRT in dealing with neighbour disputes. If the Member has any specific feedback on how to improve the CDRT's processes, that is also welcome.  "
timeline and guidelines for regulation of crypto derivatives exchanges,"Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked the Prime Minister with the recent MAS consultation paper on the regulation of crypto derivatives for Approved Exchanges (a) whether MAS will establish a timeline for eventually imposing regulations on non-approved exchanges; and (b) whether MAS will issue guidelines to financial institutions offering crypto derivatives for retail investors and, if so, whether these guidelines will apply to crypto exchanges or other intermediaries.","Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): Our basic consideration for crypto-derivative products is that they are not suitable for most retail investors because they do not have intrinsic value and are subject to sharp price swings driven by speculation.Hence, MAS took a calibrated step to regulate crypto derivative products that are listed and traded only on Approved Exchanges, which are subject to regulatory requirements and supervisory oversight. But we do not extend the regulation of crypto-derivative products beyond Approved Exchanges. This would confer misplaced confidence in these highly volatile products, and lead to a wider offering of such products to retail investors. Our approach has worked so far as trading in crypto products in Singapore remains limited and only a small number of retail investors are involved.Notwithstanding, MAS has issued circulars to all financial institutions to comply with additional measures if they offer crypto products to retail investors. These include requirements for warnings tailored to the risk of transacting in crypto products in informational materials provided to investors, restrictions on advertisement, and additional margins to be collected from retail investors to mitigate the risk of large losses from trading in volatile and leveraged products.Investors should, however, be aware that these measures do not apply to entities which are not regulated by MAS. Many trading platforms operate online and are situated overseas. These are outside of MAS' regulatory oversight. Investors that trade on these platforms need to exercise caution and understand the risk of such products.MAS has also issued advisories to warn members of the public of the risks of investing in crypto products. We will continue to work with the media to highlight these risks and to raise public awareness of potential scams.International regulatory standards in the area of crypto products are still evolving. MAS is watching these developments closely and is participating actively in international regulatory discussions on how the risks posed by crypto products are best addressed."
billing arrangements for customers who switch to new electricity retailers,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) whether the Energy Market Authority (EMA) monitors Open Electricity Market providers to ensure that customers who have switched understand the full terms governing their new billing arrangements; (b) whether EMA has received complaints from customers regarding difficulties in making payment arrangements and avoiding penalty charges; (c) why providers are not required to offer the same payment mechanisms that SP Services offers; and (d) what can be done to ensure customers can seamlessly transfer their billing arrangements.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: A key priority for the Energy Market Authority (EMA) when rolling out the Open Electricity Market (OEM) is to ensure that the terms and conditions of retailers' price plans are clear and easy for household consumers to understand.Thus, EMA requires all OEM retailers to provide a Fact Sheet using a standard template for every price plan that they offer to household consumers. The Fact Sheet highlights the key features of a price plan, including the billing arrangement and any penalty charges, such as late payment or early termination fees. All OEM retailers must make their Fact Sheets easily available on their websites and on EMA's online Price Comparison Tool. They also need to obtain the consumer's explicit acknowledgement that he has read and understood the Fact Sheet during the sign-up process. EMA monitors the situation via consumer complaints, Mystery Shopper Audits and Consumer Satisfaction Surveys. Thus far, the overall level of satisfaction has been high. There has been very few complaints about payment arrangements. Retailers are given the flexibility to offer different payment arrangements to meet the needs of their customers. The more traditional payment arrangements offered by SP Group, such as GIRO, credit card and AXS Stations, are usually available. Some provide new payment methods such as PayNow, which is not offered by SP Group. Others have chosen to engage SP Group to bill and collect payment on their behalf, thereby saving their customers the need to change their billing arrangement. We encourage consumers to consider all these options and choose one that best suit their needs.  "
statistics on delivery riders affected by pmd ban and efforts to provide job search support,Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what are the efforts made by NTUC's Employment and Employability Institute (e2i) and Workforce Singapore in working with the food delivery companies to provide job search support for delivery riders affected by the PMD ban; (b) whether the Ministry tracks the number of delivery riders who have sought job search support; (c) how many delivery riders have become unemployed as a result of the PMD ban; and (d) what are the plans to support those who remain unemployed.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: Various Government agencies worked together with the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) and food delivery companies to come up with the Transition Assistance Package, or TAP for short, to help food delivery riders transition to using alternatives to e-scooters, or to other jobs. As riders do not need to inform the food delivery companies when they have decided to stop taking deliveries, there is no clear-cut way to track the number of affected riders who have become unemployed. Instead, our approach has been to proactively reach out to those who may be looking for other jobs.For affected food delivery riders who are looking to change jobs, Workforce Singapore (WSG) and NTUC's Employment and Employability Institute (e2i) have deployed career coaches on-site at food delivery companies on more than 70 occasions, and have organised a curated job fair to assist affected riders with their job search efforts. The food delivery companies have been helpful in disseminating information on these career events to their riders. Affected riders can also tap on various employment facilitation programmes under the Adapt & Grow initiative such as the Place-and-Train Programme, which provide opportunities for jobseekers to be hired and receive training for new jobs. To date, more than 180 affected riders have approached WSG and NTUC's e2i for job search support. The agencies have been actively engaging affected riders on employment assistance available to them if they wish to switch jobs, though many have not stepped forward for job search assistance. Should they subsequently decide to come forward, we will provide them with the necessary job search support.                        "
fare cap on surge pricing for private hire car operators,Mr Mohamed Irshad asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry will consider introducing a fare cap on surge pricing for private hire car operators.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Last year, when we reviewed the point-to-point (P2P) regulatory framework, the idea of setting a cap on surge pricing re-surfaced. There were mixed views on this and on balance, we decided that P2P fare regulations should focus on fare transparency. This will allow commuters to make informed decisions based on the fares set by operators. There are two safeguards to protect commuter interests. First, we only allow dynamic pricing for flat fare bookings, where fare levels must be displayed upfront, before the commuter books his ride. Second, commuters will continue to have the option to street-hail, or book taxis, according to the metered fare system, for which the fare structure, including the booking fee, requires PTC's approval. Fare levels affect the supply and demand for P2P services. This is why dynamic fares are more effective in ensuring that commuters can find rides during peak hours. There are many forms of P2P services, each requiring different fare levels, for example, larger or premium vehicles for higher fares. Given the range of service offerings and the dynamic nature of market conditions, it is best to leave fare levels to market forces. PTC does not intend to start regulating fare levels and setting caps."
measures to ensure safety of workers during construction of cross island line tunnel,"Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Transport in relation to the building of the Cross Island Line tunnel at a depth of 70 metres below ground, what kind of challenges does the Ministry anticipate that will have an impact on the safety of workers during the construction of the tunnel and what measures will be put in place to ensure their safety.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Tunnelling underground requires deep expertise, complex machinery and precise execution, regardless of the depth. The challenges faced by workers constructing the Cross Island Line tunnels are similar to those faced for the existing Downtown Line and upcoming Thomson-East Coast Line tunnels. With the implementation of appropriate mitigation measures, the deeper Cross Island Line tunnels do not pose any additional health and safety risk to workers. LTA supervises every tunnelling project closely. All tunnelling works must conform to prevailing fire, safety and health regulations. LTA also works with its contractors to ensure that there are multiple safeguards in place for workers. This includes the use of personal protective equipment, provision of adequate lighting and ventilation, as well as the regular rehearsal of contingency plans. These plans include the emergency evacuation of workers from the tunnels to the surface. "
virtual private network tokens and info-communications equipment reported lost or stolen by ministries and government agencies in past five years,Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Prime Minister in the past five years (a) how many virtual private network tokens and info-communications equipment have been reported lost or stolen by the various Ministries and Government agencies annually; (b) how many police reports have been made; and (c) whether there have been unauthorised accesses or attempts made resulting from the loss of such security devices.,"Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): Central tracking of lost ICT equipment was implemented from 2017 onwards, with GovTech's formation in late 2016. From 2017 to 2019, there was an average of 182 reports of lost ICT equipment per year, including Public Service access cards, laptops and about 55 virtual private network (or VPN) tokens. There are over 140,000 public service officers, most of whom are issued ICT equipment for work.All cases are reported to the Police. User account and VPN access are disabled once the ICT equipment is lost. Data in Government laptops, thumb drives and portable hard disks are also encrypted while tablets and mobile devices are password protected to prevent unauthorised access. There has been no known unauthorised access to Government systems arising from the loss of ICT equipment."
complaints of noise pollution caused by vehicles with modified engines,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Transport (a) how many complaints have been received from the public over the past three years about noise pollution caused by vehicle owners who modify their engines; and (b) what is LTA's process in handling such complaints and ensuring that necessary enforcement is meted out to prevent future occurrences.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Vehicle noise is caused by a variety of factors, such as illegal modifications, vehicle design or driver behavior. Since 2017, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) has received 4,377 complaints about noise pollution suspected to be caused by illegally modified vehicles. LTA takes public feedback seriously and looks into all such complaints. Over the past three years, LTA has taken action against 3,792 illegally modified vehicles based on such complaints, as well as part of its regular enforcement efforts.  Any person who illegally modifies vehicles can be fined up to $5000, imprisoned up to three months, or both. The penalties will be doubled for repeat offenders. Members of the public can report incidences of illegally modified vehicles to LTA through LTA's feedback channels. "
number of hdb flats allowed to be sold in last two years before they reached minimum occupation period,"Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for National Development in the last two years, what is the number of HDB flats that have been allowed to be sold before meeting the Minimum Occupation Period and what are the reasons for the exception being made.","Mr Lawrence Wong:  In the last two years, HDB has given approval to about 2,400 households to sell their flats before they had fulfilled the Minimum Occupation Period (MOP).The reasons for such exceptions include financial hardship, divorce or the demise of the owner. Approvals are given on a case-by-case basis, after HDB has assessed the specific circumstances of the flat owners and their families. "
initiatives to reach out to and monitor well-being of elderly persons living alone,"Mr Chong Kee Hiong asked the Minister for Health (a) what are the various initiatives to reach out to and monitor the well-being of elderly persons living alone, particularly those in the lower income brackets; and (b) whether these programmes have been effective in reducing the number of lonely elderly deaths where bodies are undetected for extended periods of time.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Government works with community partners on multi-pronged interventions to support our seniors, especially those living alone and with low income, to age well in the community. First, we reach out to seniors proactively to check on their well-being. As part of regular home visits, Silver Generation Ambassadors (SG Ambassadors) assess seniors' health and social needs, and inform them of the various Government policies and schemes to support them. The SG Ambassadors also encourage well seniors to take part in active ageing programmes, and refer frail seniors to relevant agencies for their care needs. SGO's engagements complement the efforts of Senior Activity Centres (SACs) that reach out to seniors in the community, particularly those in the lower-income group. Second, programmes are in place to support seniors' needs, especially for seniors who live alone or are low-income. A key focus area is befriending. The network of SG Ambassadors, grassroots leaders and social service agencies connects seniors at risk of social isolation to community befrienders. The befrienders visit seniors at least twice a month, supplemented with phone calls. Seniors may also be referred to CareLine, a 24/7 hotline that provides tele-befriending services as well as emergency response to seniors in distress, which is especially helpful for those living alone. There are also various community-led initiatives which complement formal befriending services, such as the ""Neighbour Cares"" programme in Jurong East. Under this pilot, resident volunteers keep a lookout for any visible signs of distress from vulnerable seniors in neighbouring units. Third, seniors with complex needs will receive more intensive follow-up. Community case management services coordinate services required by seniors who have weak social support or complex social-health needs. The Social Service Offices work closely with community partners to provide financial support to needy seniors. Community outreach teams provide seniors at risk of dementia or depression with basic emotional support and coping strategies, including where to seek help if needed. Family Service Centres also provide counselling and support services to families with seniors to help them with relationship problems, as well as financial and emotional difficulties. Seniors with care needs, and who have no or little family support, are also supported by Senior Group Homes, Sheltered Homes and Nursing Homes, which provide residential and socio-emotional support.We do not track the number of lonely elderly deaths where bodies are undetected for extended periods of time. Building communities of care is a whole of society effort. The efforts outlined above aim to enable our elderly to live well and leave well in the community. MOH will continue to work with our community partners, Government agencies and fellow Singaporeans to support our seniors.      "
measures to reduce mynah population in yishun,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the population trend of mynahs in Yishun in the past three years; (b) what are the findings and results of the tree fogging pilot project in 2016 to deter mynahs in Yishun; (c) how does the Ministry enforce the laws against bird-feeding and, to date, how many perpetrators have been penalised; and (d) what other measures are being deployed to deter or reduce the mynah population in Yishun.","Mr Lawrence Wong: NParks only started localised surveys on the myna population at hotspots in 2019, so we do not have historical data to compare. But based on this survey, we estimate that there are currently about 800 to 900 mynas roosting at hotspots near Yishun Avenue 3.The 2016 pilot in Yishun found that tree fogging had limited long-term effects as the mynas returned once the fogging stopped. Instead, NParks has been working with various stakeholders to implement a sustainable myna management strategy. This involves a holistic suite of measures such as habitat modification, and the reduction of food sources made available by humans.Habitat modification involves the directional pruning of trees to discourage mynas from roosting in the affected areas and shepherd them away from residential areas. Roost trees may also be replaced with tree types that are less preferred by the mynas. These are trees with crowns that are less dense, but will still provide greenery and shade. These measures have been effective in reducing myna roosts in Potong Pasir and Ang Mo Kio. NParks is working with the Nee Soon Town Council to implement similar measures at Yishun. Food made available by humans is also a key driver of myna population growth. In this regard, NParks monitors bird feeding hotspots and works with the Town Councils and NEA to carry out targeted enforcement operations. This includes the use of video surveillance to catch offenders in the act. In 2019, NParks issued 145 enforcement notices to bird feeders. NEA also works with food centres and coffee shops in HDB estates to ensure proper food waste management, as the presence of improperly disposed food waste exacerbates the situation.Agencies will continue to work closely with the Nee Soon Town Council to manage the myna situation at Yishun. The public must also play its part by maintaining the overall cleanliness of the environment and not feeding wild birds.  "
rationale for imposing resale levy on those who previously purchased subsidised hdb flats and presently intend to buy executive condominiums,"Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for National Development for a person who has bought a subsidised flat directly from HDB and sold it before 19 May 1997 and presently intends to purchase an Executive Condominium (EC), what is the rationale for imposing on this person a requirement that he pays a resale levy based on 20% of the purchase price of the EC.","Mr Lawrence Wong: While Executive Condominiums (ECs) are built by private developers, they are sold with initial eligibility and ownership restrictions. These restrictions include an income ceiling and a minimum occupation period, similar to those applicable to HDB flats. Taking these into account, developers put in lower bids for Government land sales for EC sites. This reduces the land costs and thus the selling prices of EC projects, compared to private condominiums of similar size and location. Since second-timer EC buyers benefit from this subsidised price, they are subject to a resale levy like second-timers who buy a new flat from HDB. This reduces the subsidy that second-timers receive compared to first-timers, thus ensuring a fairer distribution of housing subsidies. The resale levy payable depends on the prevailing policy applicable to a second-timer buyer at the time they sold their first subsidised flat. Those who sold their first subsidised flat before 19 May 1997 but opted not to pay a graded resale levy at the point of sale would have to pay a premium on the purchase price of their next subsidised HDB flat or new EC unit.                   "
proposal to review rule for not allowing residents in hdb flats to keep cats,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the rationale for not allowing people living in HDB flats to keep cats; and (b) whether the Ministry is reviewing this rule.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB's pet ownership policies have to strike a balance between residents who are pet lovers and those who are not. Irresponsible pet ownership can lead to disamenities in the community and cause unhappiness. In the case of cats, disamenities include shedding fur, defecating/urinating in public areas, and caterwauling by roaming cats. Notwithstanding these concerns, HDB recognises that there are many residents who are cat lovers and who would like to keep cats in their flats. Hence HDB will continue to review and update its pet ownership policies, together with NParks/Animal & Veterinary Service which is responsible for the broader issue of animal welfare and licensing. While we would like very much to accommodate the wishes of all pet owners, we also have to take into consideration the views of other home-owners, and take a holistic and balanced approach in addressing this issue.  "
data on appeals to cpf board to withdraw from medisave beyond annual withdrawal limit,"Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar asked the Minister for Health (a) in each year over the past five years, how many Singaporeans have made appeals to CPF Board to withdraw more from their MediSave accounts that is beyond the annual withdrawal limit; (b) how many of these appeals are for rare illnesses or medical conditions; and (c) what is the range of additional withdrawal quantum appealed for.","Mr Gan Kim Yong:  Each year, about 1.2 million Singaporeans make withdrawals from MediSave for various medical expenses. CPF Board receives between 500 to 600 appeals from Singaporeans each year to use their MediSave beyond withdrawal limits for inpatient and outpatient treatments.  The quantum of withdrawal appealed for varies, depending on various factors such as whether there are complications in treatment, or whether non-standard drugs and treatments are needed. There were about four to five MediSave appeals over the last three years for rare diseases, which affect fewer than one in 2,000 patients.                               "
plans to match senior singaporeans with singaporean teens for mentoring,"Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth whether the Ministry will consider matching Singaporeans senior in age with young Singaporeans in their teens such as to mentor them so that both the elder person and the young person can benefit through a mentor-mentee relationship.","Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: MCCY recognises the importance of mentoring. Youths who receive mentorship are more likely to be active in the community, more resilient when facing setbacks, and have higher levels of self-esteem and self-confidence. We also recognise that many seniors have the life experience and wisdom that could make them good mentors to youths. Hence, increasing mentoring opportunities, including mentoring of youths by older persons, is one of the key actions we are developing under the SG Youth Action Plan. For example, MCCY and the National Youth Council are supporting the Mentoring Alliance, a ground-up initiative comprising 11 youth sector organisations that aims to promote a local mentoring movement and foster positive youth development. Mentoring Alliance has recruited about 200 mentors, including seniors, who mentor youths in areas such as resilience building, pro-social skills and marketplace exposure. We support these efforts through the National Youth Fund. As part of the SG Youth Action Plan, we are also partnering with Young NTUC's Youth Career Network (YCN). Young NTUC's YCN aims to provide young polytechnic and university graduates with career support and guidance in Singapore, and has recently expanded its focus to include ASEAN. This is an area where the experience of our seniors in ASEAN would benefit a new generation of Singaporeans seeking out opportunities in our region.  Inter-generational mentoring can also go both ways, where youths aid our seniors in areas where our youth have expertise. For example, the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) has launched digital experiential learning journeys since 2018, where youths guide seniors to become more digitally ready. During these tours, youth volunteers from Youth Corps Singapore (YCS) personally teach seniors on using e-Payments, banking apps and cyber security tips.Beyond these current initiatives, MCCY has funding for good ideas that bring Singaporeans together, such as Our Singapore Fund. We welcome Singaporeans who are interested to promote inter-generational bonding to come forward with their ideas and energy."
update on senoko energy's request for rescue package,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether the Government has responded to Senoko Energy's request for a rescue package and whether our energy market is in trouble.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: Senoko Energy Pte Ltd (Senoko) has clarified publicly that its current financial situation does not require additional funding from the government in the foreseeable future, and that its outlook on the local power industry remains positive. Power generators have long asset lives of about 30 years. During this period, the investment of power generating companies (gencos) are subject to cyclical fluctuations in demand and supply, given that Singapore's electricity market is a competitive one. We are currently in a situation where there is an excess supply of generation capacity. Over time, this oversupply should ease as demand rises and old capacity is retired.  To help the gencos weather the present circumstances, EMA has introduced several measures. For instance, since August 2018, flexibility was provided for gencos to retire their steam plants. EMA also worked with the gencos to reduce their contracted Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) supply and divert their excess LNG purchases. The LNG terminal tariff payable by the gencos was also lowered, which would provide gencos with cost savings. In addition, EMA developed a scheme to support gencos to maintain high operational reliability and adopt good labour management and capability building practices.  Over the longer term, to ensure our electricity market remains economically efficient and resilient, EMA is also working on initiatives such as introducing a Forward Capacity Market to procure in advance the generation capacity we need to ensure reliable electricity supply. This should also provide a more steady income stream for gencos.Ultimately, EMA's primary responsibility is to maintain a well-functioning and sustainable market that promotes competition and an electricity supply that is efficient, reliable and secure. EMA cannot be responsible for the commercial viability of individual firms. EMA will continue to work with the gencos to ensure that information is available to help them make the best decisions, and ensure that our energy market remains resilient and competitive."
"effectiveness of ""platoon commander interviews"" to address mental health issues of nsmen","Mr Ong Teng Koon asked the Minister for Defence whether he can provide an update on the efficacy of ""Platoon Commander Interviews"" as an avenue to address mental health concerns of National Servicemen and whether such interviews can be extended to enlistees holding the rank of officers.","Dr Ng Eng Hen:  The SAF has a support system in place to monitor our national servicemen's mental well-being and extend support to those facing challenges in their personal lives or adjustments to military life. Besides counsellors and para-counsellors, psychologists and psychiatrists, ground commanders too play an important role within this support system.The Platoon Commander (or PC) Interview is one example. Carried out at regular intervals during Basic Military Training (BMT) and in units, this is a platform for one-to-one conversations between servicemen and their commanders. Based on our experience, it has helped our commanders to identify servicemen under their charge who are experiencing NS-related or personal problem or other mental health concern. The commanders would then extend first level advice and support or refer the servicemen for counselling or other professional interventions where necessary. Mr Ong asked if PC interviews can be extended to NSF officers. While regular interviews are not mandated for officers, all commanders engage their officers regularly to identify and support those who require assistance, including those with mental health concerns. Apart from these informal interviews with their superiors, the whole support network of counselling and helplines is available and accessible to officers. As part of our overall support system, there are trained para-counsellors in every unit to provide frontline counselling services as well as a 24-hour counselling hotline for all servicemen.                               "
access to government egazette limited to paid subscription and five-day archive,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Communications and Information what are the considerations behind the current arrangement of making the Government eGazette only available for the past five days and requiring a paid subscription to access the archive online.,"Mr S Iswaran: Previously, documents that were electronically published in the Government Gazette on the e-Gazette website were available for free access by members of the public for five days. This was an agreement between the Government and Toppan Leefung Pte Ltd (Toppan), formerly known as the Singapore National Printers Pte Ltd, that had been in place since September 1998 when the e-Gazette website was implemented. Toppan was granted a non-exclusive licence to publish documents in the Government Gazette in electronic form. As Toppan had invested in procuring, configuring, maintaining and operating the system which was used for the publication of Government Gazettes on the e-Gazette website, it was allowed to recover costs by imposing subscription fees for access to the e-Gazette archives.The documents on the e-Gazette website are mostly legislation. Current and earlier versions of all legislation are also available on the Singapore Statutes Online website hosted by the Attorney-General's Chambers. This website provides 24/7 free public access.  In this digital age when citizens get most of their information online, Government notices should be made more easily accessible to the public. We have reviewed our arrangements with Toppan. By the end of January 2020, all publications on the e-Gazette website will be made available to the public without charge, including publications that have been published for more than five days. "
update on review of pilot pre-implantation genetic screening programme,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Health (a) when will the review of the pilot Pre-Implantation Genetic Screening programme be completed; and (b) how will the Ministry determine whether the pilot has been successful.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: MOH started a three-year pilot on Pre-Implantation Genetic Screening (PGS) in 2017, to test for chromosomal abnormalities in pre-implanted embryos created through in vitro fertilisation (IVF). Under this pilot, women who are 35 years and above, or any woman with two or more recurrent implantation failures, or two or more pregnancy losses were recruited.Thus far, 298 patients have been enrolled under the pilot study. The pilot is scheduled to end in December 2019. MOH will evaluate the clinical outcomes from the pilot in consultation with experts before deciding if PGS should be a routine clinical service.The pilot study outcomes include comparing the embryo implantation success rates, pregnancy rates and live birth rates between women on IVF programmes who had received PGS with those who had not received any PGS.  The review will take into consideration the available international evidence concerning PGS testing, the ethical challenges associated with PGS and the regulatory framework that needs to be established for governing PGS."
extending obligation of employment agencies to refund 50% of service fee for premature termination of contracts with foreign domestic workers,Mr Ong Teng Koon asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether the Ministry will consider extending from six months to one year the obligation on employment agencies to provide a 50% refund of the service fee for any premature termination of contracts with foreign domestic workers; and (b) whether there are other measures to ensure that families are less dependent on luck to find suitable matches and are not subject to repeated service fees.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: Foreign domestic workers (FDWs) play an important role in supporting families in their care-giving duties and domestic work. As it is costly and disruptive to families when they hire an FDW who is not able to meet their household needs, MOM recently announced a series of measures to better support employers in the hiring of FDWs. Firstly, to improve the chances of employers being matched with FDWs who can meet their household needs, employers and employment agencies (EAs) will be able to obtain more information on the work experience of prospective FDWs from October 2020. This includes information on the FDW’s previous job scope, her former employer’s residence type and household size, and the reasons for the termination of her past employment contracts. In addition, EAs will also be able to have access to the profiles of FDWs hired by employers who had changed five or more FDWs within a span of 12 months. This will allow the EAs to better customise their services for these employers who may need more help in selecting FDWs, such as making house visits to find out more about the unique household needs of the employers and training the FDWs based on these needs.Secondly, from October 2021, all EAs will be required to provide an option to refund at least 50% of the service fee charged to employers when the FDW’s contract ends prematurely within the first six months. This will encourage the EAs to improve their matching processes and take greater ownership in finding better matches for employers. In general, six months is a sufficient period for an employer to determine if his/her FDW meets the household’s needs. MOM’s records show that the large majority of FDWs who worked for at least six months continued to stay with their employers beyond one year. Hence, beyond the initial six months of employment, it would not be fair to attribute the subsequent breakdown of the relationship to a poor match by the EA and could result in higher service fees for employers.Lastly, despite best efforts to ensure a good match, there could invariably still be disputes between employers and their FDWs. Employers can now tap on the free dispute resolution services offered by the Centre for Domestic Employees (CDE) and Foreign Worker Association for Social Support and Training (FAST) to resolve their FDW issues. The new measures will be rolled out progressively over the next two years to allow time for employers, EAs and FDWs to adjust to the changes. MOM will continue to work with the EA industry to facilitate improved matching outcomes for employers and FDWs.   "
increase in cost of medicine,"Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the cost of medicines in Singapore has increased over the last three years and, if so, what are the reasons; and (b) whether the Government will consider improving the affordability of medicines in Singapore by closing the gap between the prices of medicines here and those in neighbouring countries.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Changes in the pricing of medications depend on several factors, such as whether they are patent protected, whether there are comparable alternatives, as well as the cost of development, production and distribution. Between countries, the prices of drugs may also differ significantly as suppliers take into account differences in market size, ability to pay, supply chain structure, competition and currency differences.We are taking various steps to manage drug costs. First, we are aggregating drug demand and integrating supply chain management across the public healthcare sector through the Agency for Logistics Procurement and Supply (ALPS) to achieve better economies of scale and create greater negotiating leverage. ALPS is consolidating functions, such as purchasing, storage, packaging and dispensing, so as to lower the cost of managing our drug supply chain. ALPS will also progressively streamline their system and deploy technology to improve supply chain efficiencies.Second, we are adopting value-based pricing approaches for drug purchases, especially for patented drugs. The Agency for Care Effectiveness (ACE) performs health technology assessment to evaluate the benefits of a drug. It then negotiates drug prices to levels commensurate with the benefits. Third, we are making efforts to ensure the appropriate use of drugs. We encourage doctors to recommend or prescribe drugs where there is evidence that it is effective for the patients’ specific conditions, and to avoid prescribing drugs where benefits are unproven or unclear. Where a less costly generic alternative is just as effective, we encourage the use of the generic version. ACE publishes guidances to help doctor keep abreast of the latest clinical evidence. MOH also tracks generic vs branded drug utilisation patterns in our public healthcare institutions to encourage the use of generics where appropriate. In addition, MOH regularly reviews the drugs we subsidise in the public healthcare sector to add those assessed to be clinically effective and cost effective. Over the last three years, about 40 additional drugs were listed for subsidy. Where they apply, MediSave and MediShield Life also help patients pay for their drug bill. For those who are unable to afford, there is MediFund and the Medication Assistance Fund that can be tapped on to help the patient pay for their drugs."
measures to raise awareness for new safety requirements under work injury compensation act,Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the training and communication plan to employers for the new safety requirements under the Work Injury Compensation Act; (b) how does the Ministry ensure that workers know who to approach when they encounter work injuries; (c) what is the number of times that errant doctors have been reported over migrant work injuries in the last three years; (d) what is the number of civil claims for such work injuries that have been won in the last three years; and (e) how does the Ministry ensure that the Singapore Medical Council and Law Society of Singapore support efforts to protect migrant workers in work injury cases.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: MOM has been actively engaging employers to inform them about the new requirements under the Work Injury Compensation Act (WICA). We have advertised the new requirements on mainstream newspapers and social media platforms, and provided resources on MOM website to guide employers.Together with the Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF), National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) U SME and Singapore Institution of Safety Officers (SISO), we have briefed close to 2,000 employers, HR practitioners and safety officers in the past two months following the passing of the WICA amendments. We have also worked with them to disseminate information regarding the new requirements to their broader membership base. We will be briefing more employers in the coming months.Through the mandatory Settling-in Programme (SIP) for foreign workers, we have been educating workers that they should approach their immediate supervisors if they sustain work injuries. We have published guides in the workers’ native languages and have been working with partners such as the unions to raise awareness.On the question of errant doctors, we received seven complaints in the last three years, of which four were referred to the Singapore Medical Council (SMC). They are pending SMC’s investigation.We do not track the outcome of civil claims, although the Commissioner of Labour awarded compensation to about 45,000 WICA claims in the last three years.We will continue to refer cases of suspected professional misconduct by doctors and lawyers to SMC and Law Society of Singapore, respectively, for investigation and disciplinary action. We support their investigations by performing our own enquiry into workers’ complaints, and sharing our findings and assessments with the professional bodies. For instance, in cases of insufficient medical leave, we would advise the worker to get treatment at another clinic if they have not already done so. We would then share the first and second doctor’s prescription of medical leave with SMC, and provide them the assessment of whether the first doctor’s prescription seemed insufficient for the injury.            "
beneficiaries of long-term care schemes may jeopardise their eligibility for other social and healthcare assistance schemes,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) whether financial benefits from the Home Care-giving Grant, MediSave withdrawal for Long-Term Care, Elder Fund and CareShield Life will result in (i) a change of monthly household income for one's national means-testing status assessment and (ii) a change in eligibility for ComCare assistance and MediFund; (b) how does the Government ensure that residents who benefit from the long-term care schemes are aware about how they may jeopardise their eligibility for other social and healthcare assistance schemes; and (c) how are policies designed to minimise this negative effect of opportunity costs in terms of benefits received.","Mr Desmond Lee: Financial assistance from help schemes such as the Home Care-giving Grant, MediSave withdrawal for Long-Term Care, ElderFund and CareShield Life, will not affect the computation of household monthly income used in means testing. Household monthly income per person refers to one’s basic employment income, trade or self-employed income, overtime pay, allowances, cash awards, commissions, and bonuses. However, we will take into consideration various financial assistance schemes when determining eligibility for ComCare assistance and MediFund. ComCare assistance is for those who need it the most. ComCare assistance covers basic living expenses when other forms of financial assistance cannot sufficiently cover these. Where clients are still unable to meet their basic living expenses, which may include medical consumables, we will provide ComCare assistance. We will also refer them to agencies that provide subsidised or free day-care or home-care services if needed.  Similarly, MediFund is a safety net for needy patients who are unable to afford their healthcare bills after exhausting other support means. Independent MediFund committees assess each applicant holistically. For disabled persons, the committees take into account their higher healthcare expenses and sources of support, including financial assistance from various schemes. This will help the committees provide more support to those who may not have access to these schemes, and ensure that no Singaporean will be denied appropriate healthcare.   Each family that applies for financial assistance is considered on a case-by-case basis, to ensure that they receive the assistance that they need for their basic living expenses and healthcare bills."
financial assistance for families with special needs adult members,"Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Social and Family Development what financial avenues of help are there for families with adult members who have special needs such as dyslexia, autism and Down's Syndrome and who wish to enrol them into programmes to make them employable or socially engaged.","Mr Desmond Lee: We support adult persons with disabilities (whether medically diagnosed with intellectual disability, physical disability, sensory impairments or Autism Spectrum Disorder) through a range of services in employment, independent living and care. Adults with dyslexia receive the same support if they have the same medical diagnosis.For job-ready persons with disabilities looking for employment, they can approach SG Enable for employment assistance. SG Enable runs career fairs, internship and mentorship programmes, and works with partner agencies on job placement and support. These are funded by the Government. SG Enable also administers the Open Door Programme Training Grant, which subsidises up to 90% of course fees to support the employability of persons with disabilities.Those who are unable to work in an open employment setting can enrol in Sheltered Workshops, which are also funded by the Government. These workshops collaborate with industry partners to offer job training and enrichment programmes.Those who require long-term care support can enrol in Day Activity Centres (DACs). These centres aim to equip persons with disabilities with community and daily living skills to enable them to live as independently as possible at home and within the community. DAC fees vary depending on the programme that the client is enrolled in, with low-income families receiving more fee subsidies. SG Enable also administers various schemes that support persons with disabilities to live independently in their homes and the community. The Assistive Technology Fund subsidises up to 90% of the cost of buying, replacing and repairing assistive technology devices that help in independent living. To facilitate mobility, SG Enable provides transport subsidies to persons with disabilities, through the Public Transport Concession Scheme, Voluntary Welfare Organisation (VWO) Transport Subsidies, Taxi Subsidy Scheme, and the Disabled Persons Scheme. All these schemes aim to help persons with disabilities to enhance their employability, their ability to live independently and be socially engaged."
measures to reduce unemployment among pmets,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Government is reviewing the causes for the rising unemployment rate among PMETs and what measures are being considered to reduce it.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: The unemployment rate of resident PMETs, which is released annually, fell from 3.1% in 2016 to 2.9% in 2018. The 2019 PMET unemployment rate is not yet available.However, latest available data suggest that there are still job opportunities for PMETs. As at June 2019, there were over 28,000 PMET job vacancies. Total employment grew by 22,400 in the third quarter of 2019, largely in Community, Social & Personal Services, Professional Services and Information & Communications, sectors where PMETs make up the majority of their workforce. From January to August 2019, Workforce Singapore (WSG) and its partners placed 11,700 PMETs through the Adapt & Grow (A&G) initiative. Nonetheless, there are PMET segments we are monitoring closely, such as mature PMET jobseekers, and those who are long-term unemployed. These groups may face greater challenges entering new jobs due to more cautious hiring and mismatches in wage expectations or skills.Under the A&G initiative, WSG provides a range of programmes to address such mismatches. For example, the Career Support Programme (CSP) provides salary support to employers who hire long-term unemployed or mature retrenched PMETs. There are currently over 100 Professional Conversion Programmes (PCPs) which provide employers with training and salary support to re-skill and hire mid-career local jobseekers. These programmes provide higher support to mature or long-term unemployed jobseekers. WSG is working closely with economic agencies and companies to increase capacity for PCPs as well as to pre-emptively retrain workers at risk of retrenchment so that they can take on new jobs within their companies.                      "
requests for use of cpf retirement account funds to service hdb housing loans or purchase hdb flats,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Manpower (a) for each of the past five years, how many appeals have been received to request use of monies in the CPF Retirement Account to service HDB housing loans or purchase HDB flats; (b) how many of these appeals have been approved; and (c) whether CPF and HDB will work together to provide assistance to those whose appeals are rejected.","Mrs Josephine Teo: Our CPF system aims to help members meet three basic needs in retirement – housing, medical care and day-to-day spending. The bulk of members' CPF contributions goes into the Ordinary Account (OA), which may be used to buy a home. MediSave helps them pay for MediShield Life premiums and major medical expenses not covered by insurance.The primary purpose of Special and Retirement Accounts (RA) savings is to ensure that members have a stream of retirement payouts to fund basic day-to-day spending. Generally, members can only use their RA savings for housing after setting aside their Basic Retirement Sum (BRS). However, the CPF Board does exercise flexibility on a case-by-case basis. Over the last five years, CPF Board approved around 80% of such appeals per year on average. These are mostly cases where some of members' OA savings had been transferred into the RA when they turned 55.To help members whose appeals were rejected, CPF Board works with HDB to assess if other more appropriate forms of assistance can be provided. For example, HDB may consider reducing or deferring the housing instalments to help flat owners who have difficulty repaying their HDB loan.  "
programmes to promote neighbourliness and tolerance,Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for National Development whether the HDB will review and enhance the programmes to promote neighbourliness and tolerances among neighbours and whether more can be done to reduce the disputes among neighbours.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Encouraging good neighbourliness is not something that HDB, as a housing authority, can do on its own. That is why the Government has a multi-pronged effort to promote neighbourliness, including through the People’s Association, grassroots leaders and community partners. For its part, HDB actively promotes neighbourly behaviour through various initiatives. These include public education exhibitions at community and school events, as well as outreach by volunteers who share tips on gracious living during door-to-door visits. HDB’s Good Neighbour Award also recognises individuals who have gone the extra mile with their acts of neighbourliness.  HDB recognises that the design of housing estates and flats can help shape and promote social interactions between neighbours. Hence, it has also paid more attention to such design details, including setting aside more community spaces like playgrounds and gardens, which have been effective in bringing neighbours together. HDB introduced the Lively Places Programme to facilitate and support ground-up community projects. Through the Programme, HDB hopes to encourage more residents to take greater ownership of place-making initiatives within the estate. These will promote greater collaboration amongst residents, and help in building closer neighbourly ties."
considerations in selecting gibraltar crescent site as singapore's first dementia care village,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Health what are the considerations behind selecting the Gibraltar Crescent site as Singapore's first dementia care village given that the state bungalows on the site are required to remain intact and given the cost of retrofitting those bungalows to make them elder-friendly residences.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The dementia care village at the Gibraltar Crescent site is intended to be a pilot to experiment with new community and housing models for seniors with dementia to age in place, supported by a model of care that is less medicalised and promotes independence and autonomy.  In land scarce Singapore, suitable sites to test such pilots are not always readily available. The Gibraltar site was shortlisted by agencies as a suitable site as it allows a home-like environment that offers opportunities to innovate care for seniors with dementia. The learnings from the pilot could then be applied to existing as well as future facilities to improve dementia care for our seniors. State-owned bungalows have been retained to preserve the heritage of the area and are leased for a variety of uses, including social use. The use of bungalows at the Gibraltar site for dementia care is in line with this approach. Retrofitting is allowed based on guidelines of Additions & Alterations and prospective tenderers will bear the cost of retrofits and take that into account in bidding for the site. "
applications for hdb rental flats by distressed individuals and assistance for them to buy flexi flats,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development (a) in each of the last five years, how many applications have been received for HDB rental flats by (i) divorcees (ii) bankrupts (iii) those who run into financial difficulty due to repayment of debt arising from business failures (iv) those facing debt repayment due to gambling and (v) those facing family disputes and refusal of help by family members; and (b) whether help has been and can be given to them to buy one- or two-room flexi flats with shorter tenures on an exceptional basis.","Mr Lawrence Wong: From 2015 to September 2019, HDB received about 10,300 requests from divorcees seeking to rent a flat from HDB. HDB does not specifically track whether rental applicants are bankrupt, in financial difficulties due to business failure or gambling, or facing family disputes. HDB has helped rental applicants with sufficient budget to buy short-lease 2-room Flexi flats on an exceptional basis, for example by exercising flexibility on the age requirement.HDB will continue to offer public rental flats for households who have no other housing options and no family support."
measures at public hospitals to guard against haze and heat,Ms Yip Pin Xiu asked the Minister for Health (a) how are public hospitals prepared to guard against both haze and heat; (b) whether there is a recommended temperature/humidity threshold for certain procedures to kick in at public hospitals and other providers of social services to the elderly; and (c) whether statistics on hospitalisation rates from heat stroke or dehydration are collected.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: MOH works with public hospitals to ensure the welfare of patients and staff during periods of haze or heat. They may deploy portable air purifiers and coolers in wards where needed. Newer hospitals such as Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, Jurong Community Hospital and Sengkang General and Community Hospitals also have built in air filtration systems to supply filtered air to naturally ventilated wards.While MOH does not stipulate temperature and humidity thresholds at public hospitals or eldercare facilities, newer institutions are designed to ensure adequate air flow through the naturally ventilated areas. Older hospitals have progressively implemented mitigating measures such as spot-cooling to lower the ambient temperatures when they are re-modelled or renovated. Drinking water is readily available within the institutions for staff and patients or clients, including the elderly to stay hydrated. On heat stroke and heat exhaustion, there are approximately 100 hospital admissions annually over the past five years. "
proposal to ban practices of declawing cats and debarking dogs,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry will consider banning the practices of declawing cats and debarking dogs in the upcoming review of standards in the pet sector.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: NParks does not encourage the practices of declawing cats and debarking dogs. Such procedures should only be performed as an absolute last resort, or as an alternative to euthanasia. NParks has a framework in place to regulate these practices. The Code of Ethics for Veterinarians requires veterinarians to advise their clients of non-surgical alternatives and to ensure that all reasonable efforts have been made to manage the problem prior to performing such surgeries. Failure to do so can result in written warnings, composition fines, or even suspension or revocation of veterinary licences. This regulatory approach remains relevant.NParks will continue to educate pet owners and raise awareness on alternatives to declawing and debarking."
reduction in sulphur dioxide emissions from vessels at singapore port after enforcement of imo 2020,Mr Ong Teng Koon asked the Minister for Transport what is the expected reduction in the amount of sulphur oxide emissions from vessels operating in the Port of Singapore after the International Maritime Organisation's 2020 sulphur emissions cap on marine fuels (IMO 2020) is enforced.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: When the International Maritime Organization's 2020 global sulphur limit (IMO 2020) comes into effect on 1 January 2020, the permitted limit of sulphur content in marine fuel used on board ships internationally and calling at the Port of Singapore, will be reduced from 3.5% currently, to 0.5%. Based on estimates by the IMO, the expected reduction of sulphur oxide emissions globally will be more than 80%, when IMO 2020 enters into force. We expect the reduction of sulphur oxide emissions from vessels operating in the Port of Singapore to be similar in proportion."
purchase of car seats with child development account savings,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Prime Minister whether he will allow parents to use the savings in the Child Development Account (CDA) to purchase child car seats.,"Mrs Josephine Teo (for the Prime Minister): The Child Development Account (CDA) is meant to support the developmental needs of children, such as education and healthcare. Parents can use the CDA to pay for expenses at Approved Institutions such as child care centres, kindergartens, hospitals, clinics and pharmacies.In addition to the CDA, the Government provides a Baby Bonus Cash Gift of $8,000 to $10,000 per child, which parents can use to pay for other items such as child car seats."
strengthening singaporean talent pool in local finance industry,Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng asked the Prime Minister whether he can provide an update on the efforts in strengthening a Singaporean talent pool in the local finance industry.,"Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): Building a strong pipeline of local talent is a key priority for the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), and critical to our desire to develop a world class workforce for the financial services sector. The financial services Industry Transformation Map (ITM) sets out our strategies in some detail to achieve this. MAS has been working closely with our tripartite partners including financial institutions, the labour movement, and government agencies to implement these strategies.As a result of our efforts, from 2016 to 2018, the financial services and fintech sectors saw a net increase of about 4,900 jobs on average each year, which is in fact above the ITM target of 4,000 per annum. This year, despite the slowdown in the economy, hiring in the sector remains healthy. Let me outline MAS' key strategies to build a strong pipeline of local talent in financial services.  First, reskilling and redeploying local professionals into functions where jobs are growing. MAS, IBF, and the financial industry are working together to prepare our workforce with the skills for these jobs. Financial institutions have committed to reskill about 4,100 professionals under the Professional Conversion Programme (PCP) in the next two years, and to redeploy them in new or enhanced jobs. Tripartite partners are also supporting Singaporeans with resources on training and career services to cater to their aspirations. For example, in the equities market, NTUC, e2i, MAS, IBF, and the Society of Remisiers, have organised workshops for remisiers on future skills, jobs in demand, and career profiling assessments. We have seen good turnouts and received positive feedback. Second, building technology skills for the financial services sector. The Technology in Finance Immersion Programme (TFIP) was launched in April this year to train local professionals in specific technology areas such as cloud computing, data analytics, full stack development and cyber security, through structured training and attachments with participating financial institutions. The inaugural phase for TFIP saw overwhelming demand for the more than 80 positions across banking, asset management and capital markets. We will expand the programme to include more employers and job openings.Third, growing our talent pool and deepening specialist skillsets. We are leveraging work-learn pathways, which integrate classroom learning with structured on-the-job training, to prepare tertiary students for financial services sector jobs. For example, the Applied Wealth Management track in NTU's Bachelor of Business programme saw many of the inaugural batch of 33 students being offered jobs after they completed their first 10-week internship with DBS. We look forward to more such partnerships. MAS and IBF are also working with the industry to establish competency standards in key job families to guide the design of training programmes for our local workforce. We also subsidise the training programmes heavily to make them accessible to workers. Over the past three years, an average of 21,000 individuals have benefited each year from these training subsidies. In addition, we have awarded about 440 scholarships and awards over the past three years to support training in specialist skills.Fourth, developing the local leadership pipeline. As Singapore grows its role as an international financial centre, more regional and global leadership positions are opening up here. We want to help more Singaporeans equip themselves to compete for and take on these leadership roles. MAS has supported financial institutions efforts to groom younger Singaporean talents through structured management associate programmes, send promising Singaporeans for overseas postings, and deepen the finance leadership capabilities of senior Singaporean professionals. About 700 Singaporeans have been supported under these programmes from 2016 to 2018, and many have progressed to take on larger roles within their firms."
impact of haze on tourist arrivals and attendance of major events,Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what is the impact of the haze on tourist arrivals in Singapore; and (b) what has been the impact of haze on attendances at major events here.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: From January to September 2019, tourist arrivals grew by 2.1% compared to the same period in 2018 to reach about 14.3 million. We are unable to ascertain the exact impact of the haze on tourist arrivals, but it is possible that our tourist numbers could have grown even more if not for the haze in August and September.  Transboundary haze has been a persistent problem in our region and could have a negative impact on outdoor activities. The extent of the impact depends on the severity and duration of the haze. For this year, we have been fortunate that it has not caused major disruptions in our economy thus far. However, this may not always be the case if the haze persists. This is why it is important for Singapore to continue working with our neighbours to implement haze mitigation measures and to ensure our economy is sufficiently diversified to remain resilient to external shocks. The impact of transboundary haze is far-reaching. It is not just Singapore's economy and the health of our people that are affected, but the economies and health of those in the region as well. The fires also released large amounts of greenhouse gases which add to global warming concerns. It is important for ASEAN countries to work together to tackle this serious problem, and prevent the haze from recurring.                           "
achievements of overseas singaporean unit since formation in 2006,Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng asked the Minister for Trade and Industry what are the achievements of the Overseas Singaporean Unit (OSU) since its formation in 2006.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: Singaporeans are our family, no matter where they are in the world. As with family members around the world, we keep in touch regularly and stay connected. The Overseas Singaporean Unit, or OSU in short, was formed in 2006 to coordinate the Government's efforts to engage overseas Singaporeans. Since 2006, OSU's suite of face-to-face programmes and online engagement channels have reached out to more than 100,000 overseas Singaporeans. OSU has successfully cultivated an extensive network of overseas Singaporean clubs and associations, as well as community leaders who take an active role in galvanising the overseas Singaporean communities around the globe. Cumulatively, these overseas Singaporean communities organise more than 100 events annually, such as National Day or festive celebrations, social gatherings, and networking events. On 1 June 2019, OSU became part of the Singapore Global Network – SGN in short – within EDB. SGN's mandate is to broaden and deepen our overseas Singaporean network with friends and fans of Singapore. This stronger and wider network will serve Singaporeans and Singapore well, for economics, fellowships and friendships. This is especially important in the increasingly tumultuous and fragmented world today. I look forward to what the SGN can do for Singaporeans and for Singapore."
ensuring food delivery process and carrier bags comply with hygiene standards,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) how does the Ministry ensure that the food delivery process and carrier bags comply with hygiene standards; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider requiring all food delivery workers to attend compulsory food hygiene and handling courses.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Food delivery companies are responsible for ensuring that the food they deliver is transported in a manner that is safe to eat and does not compromise food safety. This includes maintaining the cleanliness of the vehicle, as well as the receptacle and equipment used for the transportation of food, including carrier bags; and storing food at the correct temperature. Failure to do so would constitute an offence under the Sale of Food Act and the Environmental Public Health Act. The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) has been engaging food delivery companies on the need to adopt good practices in food hygiene and safety.Food delivery workers are not directly involved in the preparation of food, such as the washing and cutting of raw food and the processing of ready-to-eat food. Therefore, there is no requirement for them to attend and successfully complete the Basic Food Hygiene Course. Nonetheless, SFA will continue to closely monitor the industry and will tighten requirements to ensure food safety if this becomes necessary."
assistance extended to trafficked victims while they are waiting for cases to be heard,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Home Affairs how are trafficked victims being assisted while waiting for their cases to be heard and what can be done to better support their rehabilitation.,"Mr K Shanmugam: While waiting for their cases to be heard, victims are provided with shelter, food and counselling. Additional victim care support is also available, depending on the victim’s individual circumstances. An example of additional support is home leave, where agencies make arrangements, including buying air tickets, for victims to return home, where they may get more emotional support, while awaiting trial proceedings. This is on the understanding that they will return for the trial. Another example is the Temporary Job Scheme, under which the Government assists victims who are willing and able to work. Such temporary employment facilitates the victims' rehabilitation while they remain in Singapore to assist with investigation and prosecution.The Government partners NGOs, such as HAGAR and the Good Shepherd Centre, to support the victims.  "
increasing number of skillsfuture awards for singaporeans aged 40 and above in view of economic slowdown,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry asked the Minister for Education whether the Ministry will consider expanding the number of SkillsFuture awards for Singaporeans of age 40 and above in view of the economic slowdown.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: The SkillsFuture Study Awards support early to mid-career Singaporeans to deepen their skills in growth sectors or areas of demand. The number of study awards is determined by sectoral lead agencies based on each sector’s manpower and skills needs.  Should economic and labour conditions worsen, the Government will consider introducing additional measures to help employers and employees with training and skills upgrading, so that our workers can acquire the relevant skills to stay employed, or transit to other sectors and companies. This will include Professional Conversion Programmes."
2019 trend for bankruptcy orders,Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked the Minister for Law (a) what is the trend in 2019 in terms of bankruptcy orders; (b) whether the trend is expected to continue; (c) what is the level of bankruptcy orders compared to that of previous years; and (d) what are the specific factors causing the trend in bankruptcy orders.,"Mr K Shanmugam: One thousand one hundred and twelve bankruptcy orders were made between 1 January and 31 August 2019. This is comparable to the number of bankruptcy orders made in the past five years, which saw an average of 1,725 bankruptcy orders made each year."
re-employment of retired saf officers and training for saf officers to find second careers after retirement,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Defence (a) how many SAF officers are re-employed from 2017 to 2019; (b) how successful has the Ministry been in helping retired SAF officers to prepare for and find second careers after their retirement; and (c) what are the measures taken to ensure that officers have transferable skills upon retirement.,"Dr Ng Eng Hen: The structure for a career within the SAF takes into account the need to maintain a credible defence force. Apart from leadership and management skills, SAF personnel must also be able to undertake physically demanding tasks, when called upon. Based on these requirements, SAF officers and warrant officers retire around 50 years old while military experts can work till 60 years of age. To compensate SAF personnel for their shorter careers, remuneration packages are higher and pegged to equivalent civilian jobs with older retirement ages. Retired personnel can be re-employed in limited vocations that do not require the physical rigour, but this forms a small proportion of vocations within the SAF.Instead, SAF assists its retired personnel to continue with second careers. They receive support from certified career advisors in our own Career Transition Resource Centre, with services such as career coaching, networking events and job referrals. They are also provided funds and time-off under the Lifelong Employability & Advancement Programme (LEAP) to attend courses and seminars, go for job interviews, and embark on internships that can serve as a springboard into their sector of interest. These programmes have successfully assisted our personnel in their transitions; 80% secure jobs within six months of retiring from the SAF.Employer surveys show that the skills and certifications obtained by SAF personnel during their careers are well-recognised by private and public sector employers. Our personnel undergo structured training to prepare them for leadership and management roles. They are also equipped with valuable competencies in areas such as human resource, finance, operations research and training pedagogy. A number of our programmes are developed under the Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ) system, which ensures that the training SAF personnel receive are aligned to industry standards and therefore transferable. The SAF also collaborates with local educational institutions on work-study programmes that enable our servicemen to translate their work experience into professional accreditation. "
performance metrics to track efficacy of skillsfuture programme,Mr Ong Teng Koon asked the Minister for Education what are the performance metrics to track the efficacy of the SkillsFuture programme and how has the programme improved productivity and employment opportunities.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: The SkillsFuture programme comprises many initiatives to support the lifelong learning needs of Singaporeans from all walks of life.There has been no widely accepted metrics to measure the efficacy of training, despite many countries having worked on this for many years. Nonetheless, Singapore has been evaluating the outcomes of training through several measures. One such way is to collect feedback from employers and individuals on course quality and training outcomes. Post training surveys show that more than 80% of trainees felt that work performance improved after training. Additionally, MOM's Employer-Supported Training Survey found that 92% of employers reported that training had a significant positive impact on the performance of their workers.There are also programme-specific studies, to evaluate the impact of training on wage and employment outcomes. For example, a study by MTI found that non-employed trainees who completed their Singapore Workforce Skills Qualification (WSQ) training were more likely to find employment and earn higher wages than their previous jobs. The same study also found that WSQ trainees experienced a wage premium of up to 6% compared to trainees who did not attend such training. MTI has also studied the wage data of the initial batches of graduates from the SkillsFuture Earn and Learn Programme (ELP). It found that ELP graduates enjoyed a sustained wage premium of about 10%, over Polytechnic diploma graduates.  At the national-level, we have seen a rise in the training participation rate of the resident labour force, in tandem with the roll-out of various SkillsFuture programmes. Based on MOM's Labour Force Survey, the training participation rate increased from 35% in 2015 to 48% in 2018.We are making good progress and achieving encouraging momentum with SkillsFuture. We will continue to monitor the training outcomes and enhance the programmes to prepare workers for changes in our economy, and to support lifelong learning for Singaporeans."
plans to make higher education in singapore more accessible for differently-abled,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Education (a) what are the Ministry's plans to make higher education in Singapore more accessible and inclusive for the differently-abled by disabilities; and (b) what are the support schemes, financial or otherwise, that are available to such students.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: MOE is committed to ensuring that all students, including those with Special Educational Needs (SEN) enrolled in our Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs), receive the support they need. Hence, all IHLs have set up dedicated SEN Support Offices which provide one-stop services to support students with SEN, from pre-enrolment to graduation. Before enrolling in an IHL, students can approach the SEN Support Offices in the IHLs for advice on the types of courses that might be more suited to their interests and learning needs. We also put in place arrangements where schools will share SEN-related information with IHLs, to facilitate the students’ transition to a new education environment. For Polytechnic and ITE students who require financial support in purchasing education-related assistive technology devices and support services, they can tap on the SEN fund. Eligible students with physical impairment may draw up to $5,000 from the SEN fund while those with visual or hearing loss may draw up to $25,000 over the course of their study, with more support provided to those with higher needs. Students with severe hearing, physical and visual impairment may draw up to $70,000 from the SEN fund over the course of their study. To prepare students with SEN for the workforce, our IHLs put in additional effort in career guidance to these students, including helping them identify suitable internship opportunities and prepare them for their internships. The IHLs also work closely with SG Enable and Voluntary Welfare Organisations for specialised mentorship programmes and job matching. They are also training faculty and staff to raise their awareness and understanding of SEN, and to build a more inclusive campus culture.                "
qualifications of and complaints against chiropractors practising in singapore,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the current number of chiropractors and chiropractic chains locally; (b) how many complaints against chiropractors or chiropractic chains have been received over the last five years; and (c) how is the training and qualification of chiropractors different from that of physiotherapists or Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Chiropractic Association (Singapore) estimates that there are about 150 chiropractors in Singapore. Based on the number of business entities1 registered with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA), the number of chiropractic establishments is estimated to be about 90.  Over the past five years, MOH received an average of four chiropractic-related feedbacks per year, usually related to the misleading use of titles, advertising or claims, and sales and refunds on treatment packages. Chiropractic services are considered as complementary and alternative treatments, and are not licensed under the Private Hospital and Medical Clinic Act (PHMCA). Chiropractors are encouraged to practise self-regulation through their professional associations.           Most chiropractors in Singapore have four or more years of overseas university or postgraduate studies. For TCM practitioners, applicants with a five-year local Advanced Diploma in TCM or an overseas TCM Bachelor's degree recognised by the TCMP Board can qualify for the Singapore TCMP Registration Examination. For physiotherapists, the Singapore Institute of Technology offers a four-year Physiotherapy Bachelor's degree programme, jointly developed with Trinity College Dublin. The Allied Health Professions Council also maintains a list of recognised overseas qualifications for physiotherapists to practice locally."
recent trends and main concerns of re-employment disputes,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo asked the Minister for Manpower what is the number of cases and trend of re-employment disputes over the last three years and what were the main issues.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: MOM attended to about 60 re-employment disputes annually between 2016 and 2018. The extension of the re-employment age from 65 to 67 in 2017 made more workers eligible. This, together with heightened awareness on re-employment rights and obligations, may explain the recent uptick of disputes. Nonetheless, the number of re-employment disputes remains very small relative to the number of employees aged 60 to 69 years1 – with fewer than one in 3,000 employees filing reports with MOM.The disputes were mainly over whether employees met the performance criteria or the medical fitness required for re-employment or dissatisfaction with the re-employment terms offered. Close to 70% of the cases handled by MOM were resolved through mediation, with the remaining mostly withdrawn. About four cases each year proceed to adjudication. The tripartite partners are committed to achieving productive longevity in Singapore. Even as our workforce ages, it can remain competitive and adaptable. While employees need to have the right mindset and be willing to pick up new skills to adapt to the changing environment, employers should redesign jobs and provide the necessary training to their older workers. This will minimise re-employment disputes and ensure that older workers continue to thrive in the future economy."
enhancing practices and regulations for funeral service sector,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) how is NEA working with funeral professionals to ensure that our departed loved ones are treated with dignity when taken into their care; (b) whether there has been any recent consultation with the industry on enhancing present regulations and practices; (c) whether any enhancements are expected; and (d) whether there are plans for a legislative and regulatory framework to govern the industry and to protect bereaved families.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The National Environment Agency (NEA) regulates funeral parlours to ensure that these facilities meet specific public health requirements. As part of the regulatory regime, NEA conducts periodic inspections of funeral parlour premises. NEA also engages the funeral services industry regularly on issues related to after-death services. Earlier in the year, NEA had conducted a round of environmental hygiene inspections of all 21 licensed funeral parlours with embalming facilities. Following these inspections, NEA issued a circular to remind licensed operators of their responsibilities under the licensing conditions, along with advice on the appropriate handling of the deceased. Beyond ensuring environmental public health, after-death services should be provided in a manner that is in accordance with religious practices and cultural preferences, and accords dignity to the deceased and comfort to bereaved families. In August this year, as part of continuing efforts to improve standards, NEA had engaged funeral directors and funeral parlour operators to seek their views on how the provision of after-death services could be enhanced. NEA is reviewing the suggestions from this engagement. We will continue to work with the Association of Funeral Directors Singapore, funeral directors and funeral parlour operators, in consultation with religious groups, to enhance the standards of after-death facilities and services in Singapore. "
proposal to review bto queuing method,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development (a) in determining the number of queue numbers to be issued to BTO flat applicants, what is the multiplier used in relation to the number of BTO flats for sale in the non-mature and mature estates respectively; (b) what has been the take-up rate for these applicants in 2016 to 2018 as compared to that in 2013 to 2015; and (c) whether the Ministry will review the BTO application process to allow those who have been given a queue number to drop out sooner so as to expedite the flat selection process.","Mr Lawrence Wong: For all flats offered in BTO exercises, HDB shortlists applicants up to 300% of the flat supply.  In both 2013 to 2015 and 2016 to 2018, about three in five applicants who were invited to book a flat in a BTO exercise proceeded to do so.  Shortlisted flat applicants are invited to book a flat in sequence of their balloted queue positions. They may request HDB to cancel their applications at any time. Generally, applicants are more likely to drop out nearer their flat booking appointment, or during the appointment itself, when their preferred flats are no longer available. At that point, it would be too late to advance the appointments of subsequent applicants as we will not be able to give them sufficient notice.  Shortlisted flat applicants may continue to apply for a flat in another sales exercise as long as they have yet to book a flat. This ensures that they will not miss out on applying for a flat in another sales launch, if there are flats they are interested in, even while waiting for their booking appointment from an earlier sales exercise."
public education to clear misconceptions about breast cancer screening,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry can strengthen public education to clear misconceptions and fear by women of breast cancer screening.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Early detection of breast cancer through screening is important because the outcomes of treatment for early stage cancers are better, compared with late stage breast cancer. Based on findings from focus group discussions conducted by the Health Promotion Board (HPB), women have several misconceptions surrounding breast cancer screening. Some examples include screening not being necessary when one feels healthy, ""it is better not to know"", and that mammograms are painful.HPB partners organisations including Singapore Cancer Society, Breast Cancer Foundation, National Cancer Centre Singapore and National University Cancer Institute to address these misconceptions, and to make screening and the follow-up process easier to understand. HPB and its partners also actively dispel misconceptions associated with breast cancer screening and encourage regular screening through the annual Breast Cancer Awareness campaign, forums, media messages and in talks delivered by community leaders and breast cancer survivors.However changing entrenched misconceptions is not an easy task. MOH and HPB will continue our efforts on public education on breast cancer and we welcome suggestions to improve our early detection efforts and save lives. "
permanent residents hired as drivers by private hire car operators,Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for Transport (a) how many private hire car operators currently employ permanent residents (PRs) as private hire drivers; (b) what is the total number of PRs hired as such drivers with these operators; and (c) whether the companies are required to post job vacancies on the national Jobs Bank or with other recruitment entities to secure local drivers for the jobs.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Today, only Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents (PRs) are eligible for a Private Hire Car Driver's Vocational Licence (PDVL). PRs are only eligible for a PDVL if they are employed by businesses offering chauffeured services. As of August 2019, the percentage of PDVL holders who are PRs is just over 5%. MOM requires companies to post job vacancies on the national Jobs Bank before hiring Employment Pass holders. PRs do not need a work pass to work in Singapore."
outlook for retail industry given seven straight months of decline,"Mr Seah Kian Peng asked the Minister for Trade and Industry given the continued decline in retail sales for the seventh straight month, what is Ministry's assessment of the outlook for the retail industry and what will the Ministry be doing to help retailers and the workers that are employed in this sector.","Mr Chan Chun Sing: From January to August this year, retail sales volume, excluding motor vehicle sales, fell by 1.8% year-on-year. Retail demand has been affected by weaker consumer sentiments amidst heightened uncertainties in the global economy. There are also structural challenges facing our retailers, such as tighter labour constraints and increasing competition from e-commerce. There are retail companies which are doing well in this challenging environment. Some have made good use of technology to deliver new concepts and offer innovative retail experiences to their customers. Others have expanded into the e-commerce space by adopting an omni-channel format that integrates online and offline retail. For example, Skin Inc tapped on Enterprise Singapore's support to develop an online strategy targeting the Chinese market, including setting up online stores on WeChat and Weibo, which are some of the largest online platforms in China. Skin Inc has also developed an offline strategy to promote and launch new products to customers through Sephora's physical stores. This omni-channel strategy is expected to give the company a three-fold increase in its China sales.New companies have also entered the local retail scene. Last month, Japanese retail chain BEAMS set up two pop-up stores in Singapore, which are among their largest outside of Japan. This is an example of pop-up retail, which is gaining popularity as it allows retailers to test new products and concepts.As part of the rejuvenation of Orchard Road, the Orchard Road Business Association (ORBA) is curating the use of event spaces along the Orchard Road Pedestrian Mall (ORPM). Since April this year, ORBA has secured 22 pop-ups and organised monthly night markets. The ORPM is becoming the choice venue for well-known retail brands to launch new products, beyond the traditional retail setting. In January this year, we launched Design Orchard, a one-stop shop for locals and tourists seeking out unique, locally designed products, featuring over 70 local brands.  The Government will work with retail companies to upgrade their capabilities and grow their business. We introduced the Retail Industry Digital Plan in November 2017 to provide a step-by-step guide for retailers to digitalise their processes. To help retailers expand overseas, Enterprise Singapore provides internationalisation support through seminars, business missions, and building platforms for our local retailers to gain brand exposure overseas. An example is the ""Singaporium"" pop-up in Manila, Philippines, which took place in September this year. The event involved 17 local retail, food and lifestyle brands and attracted an estimated 400,000 visitors. Local fashion retailer Benjamin Barker and pet store chain Pet Lovers Centre are examples of companies which have recently expanded into regional markets such as Malaysia and the Philippines.  As the industry transforms, our workers also need to be upskilled. The Retail Skills Framework helps our retail workers assess their career interests and identifies relevant training programmes to upgrade their skills. This is supported by the efforts of our unions, Trade Associations and Chambers (TAC) and employers. Last month, Dairy Farm Singapore, the owner of retail chains including Cold Storage, Giant and 7-Eleven, set up a Jobs, Skills and Training Committee together with the Food, Drinks and Allied Workers Union to help more than 5,000 of their workers in training and skills upgrading.  Retail workers who are affected by restructuring or business closure can tap on WSG for career advisory and matching services to other hiring retail firms. There are currently around 2,000 vacancies in the retail sector, ranging from Cashiers to Marketing and Business Development Managers, and Sales Associate Professionals. Workers who would like to pursue career opportunities in a new industry can also tap on WSG’s support through the Professional Conversion Programmes (PCP) and Career Trial under the Adapt and Grow Initiative."
proper disposal of car batteries to prevent pollutive discharge in singapore's water catchment areas,Dr Teo Ho Pin asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether the Ministry can provide details on how Singapore's car industry disposes of car batteries and what measures are in place to ensure that batteries and chemicals are not disposed of indiscriminately into our water catchment areas.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: There are three main types of car batteries in the market today. They are lead acid batteries for regular cars, and lithium-ion and nickel metal hydride batteries for electric and hybrid cars.  Lead acid batteries contain lead which is harmful to the environment and human health, and acid which is corrosive. Spent lead acid batteries are classified as Toxic Industrial Waste (TIW) under the Environmental Public Health (TIW) Regulations. They are required to be collected and disposed of by Toxic Industrial Waste Collectors licensed by NEA. Lead acid batteries that have reached their end-of-life are usually removed from cars at workshops and collected by licensed Toxic Industrial Waste Collectors. These collectors must adhere to safety practices in the collection and transportation of the lead acid batteries, and are prohibited from disposing of the batteries indiscriminately, such as in general waste bins, public areas or water catchment areas. Lithium-ion and nickel metal hydride batteries from electric and hybrid cars are typically removed from cars at workshops, car dealerships or scrapyards, and sold to local e-waste recyclers or exported for resource recovery treatment. In 2021, the NEA will implement the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) approach to manage e-waste, which will cover lithium-ion batteries and nickel metal hydride batteries. Under the EPR framework, producers who bring the products to market are responsible for the collection and proper treatment of their waste. The Resource Sustainability Act will give effect to the EPR framework.  In the case of lithium-ion batteries and nickel metal hydride batteries, authorised dealers and parallel importers of electric or hybrid cars will be the designated producers. These producers will be required to provide free take-back and disposal services for all end-of-life batteries, or engage an operator who will organise the collection of batteries from scrapyards, workshops, and dealerships, and ensure that the collected batteries are properly disposed of at licensed e-waste recyclers. NEA will also impose recycling requirements that all e-waste recyclers must meet. They include requirements for the proper handling and treatment of e-waste as well as material recovery targets. NEA is working closely with LTA and industry stakeholders on the operational details. "
foreign domestic worker levy concession for families caring for persons with cognitive disabilities,Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) how many families with care recipients who have cognitive disabilities and are between 16 and 64 years of age have benefited from the policy to allow these families to apply for the Foreign Domestic Worker (FDW) levy concession and grant; and (b) what steps have been or will be taken to reach out to families who may benefit from this policy.,"Mr Desmond Lee: The Government provides two schemes to help caregivers defray the cost of hiring a Foreign Domestic Worker (FDW), in caring for persons with disabilities for all ages, including those between 16 and 64 years old.  The Ministry of Manpower offers the FDW Levy Concession to persons with disabilities if they require assistance with at least one Activity of Daily Living (ADL). The levy concession allows care-givers to pay the FDW levy at a concessionary rate of $60 a month, instead of $300. As of 30 September 2019, there were about 2,300 families with persons with disabilities aged between 16 and 64 benefiting from the FDW Levy Concession scheme. Until September 2019, the Ministry of Health offered the FDW Grant that complemented the FDW Levy Concession. Caregivers of persons with disabilities who require assistance with at least three ADLs could benefit from the FDW Grant, in addition to the FDW Levy Concession. The grant comprised a $120 monthly cash payment given to caregivers to offset the cost of hiring an FDW. As of 30 September 2019, there were 996 families with persons with disabilities aged between 16 and 64 benefitting from the FDW Grant. To enhance support for persons with disabilities, MOH introduced the Home Caregiving Grant to replace the FDW Grant on 1 October 2019. The new Grant provides a higher amount of $200 monthly cash payment to caregivers, and can be used for a broader range of caregiving expenses beyond defraying the costs of hiring FDWs. To publicise these two schemes, the Ministry of Social and Family Development has reached out to Social Service Agencies (SSAs) in the disability sector, such as Special Education schools and care service agencies, to provide them with information on applying for the FDW Levy Concession and the Home Caregiving Grant. Information on the changes to the Home Caregiving Grant has also been widely reported in the media, and publicised through social media posts. Detailed information on the Levy Concession and the Grant can also be found on the websites of the Ministry of Social and Family Development, SG Enable, the Ministry of Health, the Agency for Integrated Care and the Ministry of Manpower.

"installation of water dispensers in shopping centres, public transport stations and office buildings","Mr Mohamed Irshad asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether the Ministry has plans to directly install or encourage the installation of more water dispensers and water coolers in shopping centres, public transport stations and office buildings, to reduce the consumption of bottled water.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: My Ministry encourages the installation of water dispensers and coolers in Singapore. This supports Singapore's Zero Waste efforts by reducing the consumption of bottled water, and also supports our War on Diabetes. According to latest figures compiled by the Singapore Food Agency, we import about 17 million bottles of water per month from Malaysia alone. Given that water from the tap in Singapore is perfectly safe to drink, we can and should definitely do more to reduce consumption of bottled water.NEA has installed water dispensers in all 26 MEWR-owned hawker centres which NEA operates, and will do so in all our upcoming new hawker centres. NEA is also working with MOH and Town Councils on providing water dispensers in the HDB-owned hawker centres, as the common areas in these centres are managed by the Town Councils. Owners of other premises are also encouraged to install water dispensers and water coolers. For example, under the Green Mark for Healthier Workplaces scheme which Building and Construction Authority (BCA) and the Health Promotion Board (HPB) jointly developed, companies are awarded points for providing water dispensers in office premises. HPB's Singapore HEALTH Award also recognises companies for such efforts to create a healthier workplace. My Ministry also encourages all event organisers to use water dispensers and reusable cups instead of plastic bottles. Event organisers may refer to the ""Best Practice Guide for organising environmentally-friendly events"" that is available on the Towards Zero Waste website."
retirement adequacy for current and future cohorts of retirees of different income profiles,Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the state of retirement adequacy for current and future cohorts of retirees of different income profiles; and (b) what are the projected average monthly CPF LIFE payouts which each of these income groups are expected to receive when reach payout eligibility age.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: Members are likely to have a combination of means to fund their retirement, of which CPF is a component. The others include private savings, housing monetisation through the Lease Buyback Scheme, as well as support from their family. Nonetheless, with the Basic Retirement Sum (BRS) designed to provide members with monthly payouts in retirement that cover their basic living expenses, the BRS attainment is one indicator for retirement adequacy. Over the last decade, the proportion of active CPF members attaining their cohort BRS at age 55 has improved from about two in five to more than three in five.We are optimistic that retirement adequacy will continue to improve for younger cohorts. Among other things, their CPF balances have grown with rising incomes and labour force participation. This can translate to higher CPF monthly payouts in retirement.In fact, a recent study by MOF showed that the median real income of younger Singaporeans born in the 1970s was double compared to those born in the 1950s when both were in their 40s. The younger generation also had a labour force participation rate 10% points higher. As a result, the median real Ordinary and Special Account CPF balances of the younger generation was three times higher than the older generation, with balances at the 20th percentile more than seven times hig"
income per capita criterion for pre-school subsidies for all families,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Social and Family Development why is the Ministry not using income per capita as the basis to assess qualification for pre-school subsidies for all families instead of just for larger families of five or more members.,"Mr Desmond Lee: The Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) uses household income to assess whether a family qualifies for means-tested preschool subsidies. This approach looks only at the income of both parents of a child in a household. However, we recognise that for larger families with more dependants, total household income may not capture their financial means. Hence, we have allowed families with five or more members and who have three or more dependants, to have their income assessed on a per capita basis. The per capita approach helps larger families but is more involved, as we have to look into the income of all family members staying in the same residence.Extending the per capita approach to all families is not necessarily more advantageous for smaller households. ECDA has structured the preschool subsidies such that for 4-member households, the household income and per capita income ceilings for each subsidy tier are equivalent. What this means is that for a 4-member family with household income of $7,500, their per capita income would be $1,875 and they would fall within the same tier for Additional Subsidy regardless of the household income or per capita income approach. For a 3-member family with the same household income, their per capita income would be $2,500 and they would then be disqualified from receiving Additional Subsidy as their income exceeds the current per capita income ceiling. In summary, our approach of using household income for most families with the provision for larger families to use the per capita approach, is a pragmatic one of being helpful to larger families without disadvantaging small families or imposing a more involved assessment method on most families.                   "
update of lift upgrading programme status for flats that previously did not qualify based on cost cap quantum,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar asked the Minister for National Development whether he can provide an update on the Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP) for blocks of flats that have not been eligible for the LUP because of the cost cap quantum eligibility before an LUP is approved for a particular block.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP) was launched in 2001 to provide direct lift access to flats and enhance convenience for residents, especially the elderly and less mobile. At the start of the programme, there were more than 5,300 HDB blocks without 100% lift access. Over the years, HDB has adopted innovative technical solutions to provide such blocks with lift access. Through these efforts, the vast majority of the 5,300 blocks have since been able to benefit from LUP.  Currently, there remain about 150 blocks where it is still not possible to implement LUP due to cost considerations, or existing technical constraints. We will continue to study if there are any cost-effective solutions to extend the LUP to these blocks.  Meanwhile, Singaporeans who are in urgent need of direct lift access due to medical conditions or mobility reasons can approach HDB for housing and financing assistance. HDB will assess each request on a case-by-case basis to see how best to render help.                     "
improved chances in additional ballot for bto flats for first-time buyers who had failed attempts,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development (a) how effective has the current grant of an additional ballot chance for each failed attempt by a first-timer in securing a BTO flat been; and (b) whether HDB will review and consider alternatives such as the improvement of chances by multiples of 20% for each attempt so that the applicants will have almost guaranteed success after more than three attempts.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Currently, first-timer families are given two ballot chances when HDB shortlists flat applicants to book a flat. Those who have been unsuccessful in two attempts for BTO flats in the non-mature estates will be given an additional ballot chance at their subsequent application for a BTO flat in the non-mature estates. As a result, in recent years, virtually all first-timer families have been successful within their first three tries for a BTO flat in the non-mature estates. We will continue to review and update our policies where necessary to ensure that new HDB flats remain accessible to all first-timer families."
mrt stations with designated parking spaces for mrt maintenance vehicles,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Transport (a) how many MRT stations have designated parking spaces for the MRT maintenance vehicle and how many do not have; (b) where are these maintenance vehicles expected to park in view of the heavy equipment that the maintenance workers have to carry; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider providing designated parking spaces at all new MRT stations for maintenance work to be carried out more effectively.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: About half of all MRT and LRT stations already have designated parking spaces for maintenance vehicles. For the remaining stations where site constraints do not allow for such parking spaces, LTA has made special arrangements for maintenance vehicles to temporarily park at nearby taxi stands or bus stops during engineering hours. This ensures that workers have a safe place to alight and do not have to carry heavy equipment over long distances.For all new stations, LTA has factored in designated parking spaces for maintenance vehicles. Where site constraints do not allow for such parking spaces, LTA will work with operators to make special arrangements for maintenance vehicles to park nearby."
upgrading plans for local equities and equity derivatives market,Mr Ong Teng Koon asked the Prime Minister whether there are plans to (i) reinvigorate the local equities and equities derivatives market and (ii) help the Singaporean worker in this sector to stay relevant with technological advances.,"Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): My reply will focus on the first part of Mr Ong Teng Koon's question, on plans to re-invigorate the local equity and equity derivatives markets. I have addressed the second part of Mr Ong's question on helping Singaporeans stay relevant amidst technology advances earlier, in my response to Mr Cedric Foo's question. Let me first summarise where Singapore stands in the competition. We have a leading position as an Asian equity derivatives trading centre, just as we currently do for fixed income and foreign exchange trading. However, Singapore's cash equity market has some structural shortfalls. SGX, MAS and the industry are working to fortify our existing strengths as a financial hub, and putting particular effort into plugging the shortfalls in cash equities. Let me start very briefly with the equity derivatives market. We are a leading derivatives trading centre in Asia. Singapore-based exchanges offer a wide array of Asian and global derivatives products, including equity, foreign exchange and commodities derivatives1, and with good liquidity in each segment. The compound annual growth rate of trading volumes over the last three years grew by more than 12%. We are working continuously to grow this derivatives ecosystem – by broadening the suite of products, attracting more brokers, market makers and liquidity providers, and attracting investors to Singapore.However, Singapore's cash equity market does not enjoy the same regional leadership position. While SGX is well regarded as a listing destination for Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), and the healthcare, and consumer sectors, it has challenges in other segments.SGX, MAS and the industry have been working on several initiatives to enhance the attractiveness of Singapore as a listing and trading venue for equities.  First, to grow a pipeline of Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), SGX has attracted market makers and liquidity providers to enhance market liquidity, and admitted new Mainboard issue managers and Catalist sponsors2. These initiatives will take time to bear fruit.Second, to attract new overseas issuers and investors, SGX has been actively seeking cross-border partnerships and expanding its global footprint. SGX has partnered Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and Nasdaq to boost capital raising opportunities for technology companies. The partnerships have generated a healthy pipeline3 of companies looking to secondary list on SGX.  Third, SGX has introduced the Dual Class Share structure4. This enhances Singapore’s value proposition as a listing destination for new high-growth technology companies. With this additional listing structure, SGX is cultivating a budding pipeline of technology companies that have expressed keenness to tap on this structure for listing on SGX.Fourth, SGX has started working with private market platforms to build the IPO pipeline. Such platforms can provide growth companies access to a wide network of investors for financing needs just prior to IPO. An example is Capbridge, which has transacted $900 million of private placements and pre-IPO rounds in 2018 and currently has 45 deals in the pipeline. Fifth, SGX has stepped up its investor outreach efforts in recent years to generate investment ideas and interest. Till date, SGX's initiatives such as the SGX Equities Fund Flow Tracker and MyGateway newsletter, have reached over 270,000 individual retail investors in Singapore and over 1,000 international institutional investors.Finally, MAS is also supporting capital raising on SGX through various grant initiatives. MAS launched the S$75 million Grant for Equity Market Singapore or GEMS, in February this year, where we co-fund the listing expenses of companies in high-growth and technology sectors. We will also provide grants to widen the research coverage of SGX listed stocks, especially of small and mid-cap companies. Since the grant inception, MAS has approved seven listing grant applications. Research houses tapping on GEMS have committed to hiring close to 50 fresh graduates and experienced research analysts over the next three years.So, to repeat what I mentioned earlier, we are working on our shortfalls in the cash equity market, while at the same time fortifying our existing strengths such as in equity derivatives."
smart nation initiatives in singapore and asean,Dr Teo Ho Pin asked the Prime Minister whether he can provide an update on the progress of the Smart Nation initiatives in Singapore and ASEAN.,"Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): We continue to make steady progress in our use of digital technologies to restructure our economy, generate new jobs, solve real-world problems and improve the quality of life of our citizens. SingPass Mobile, which was launched just one year ago, has over 600,000 users enjoying secure password-less logins, and a quarter of all SingPass transactions are now conducted on SingPass Mobile. When PayNow was launched in July 2017, there were 150,000 transactions totalling about $24 million in the first month of operations. For the past quarter from July to September, PayNow transaction values have consistently crossed the S$1 billion mark each month, with more than 6 million monthly transactions during the same period.As for the Moments of Life app, since February this year, the birth registration service has expanded to cover all private hospitals, and the cumulative number of births registered via the app has increased from 2,000 to over 12,000. In September 2019, more than 60% of all eligible births were registered through the app. We have recently expanded the app to support seniors aged 60 and above in their journey to live active and engaged lives. Together, these initiatives bring greater ease and convenience to citizens, helping us to save time and enhancing our daily lives. Our digitalisation efforts are also benefiting businesses and the economy, and many companies are making use of digitalisation to spur innovation and transform their businesses. Over 450,000 entities make 30 million transactions on CorpPass yearly. More than 7,000 companies have signed up to use MyInfo to improve how they serve their consumers, including the banking sector who are using MyInfo to make the ""know-your-customer"" process quick, convenient and seamless. Just last week, the GoBusiness Licensing portal became operational. Business owners who wish to set up a food services business now only have to fill in a single form with no more than 90 data fields, as compared to 14 forms with 845 data fields previously. These initiatives help new businesses to hit the ground running, and enable existing businesses to become more customer-centric and efficient, which in turn make them more effective and competitive.Industry sectors are also benefiting from digitalisation. For example, the construction sector is adopting Integrated Digital Delivery (IDD) which harnesses Building Information Modelling technology to reap time and cost savings across the entire building life-cycle, from planning and construction to facilities management. BCA launched the IDD implementation plan last year, and aims to have more than 40 projects by next year.  Looking externally, Singapore continues to work closely with ASEAN member states to enhance smart city projects through the ASEAN Smart Cities Network (ASCN) initiated in 2018, during Singapore's chairmanship. At the ASCN annual meeting in Bangkok in August 2019, Singapore was appointed Shepherd to advise and support the ASCN Chair, as well as work with the Chair to organise programmes and initiatives – for example, capacity-building workshops – to develop the ASCN further. ASCN has generated significant interest from ASEAN’s external partners to form project partnerships with the ASCN. So far, 40 project partnerships have been signed. The US, Japan, and the ROK have launched and operationalised targeted initiatives to engage the ASCN. At the ASEAN-Australia Special Summit last year, Australia announced the ASEAN-Australia Smart Cities Initiative worth A$30 million to support the development of smart cities. The long-term success of the ASCN depends on the external partners' continued involvement, and we are heartened to see the growing strength of the ASCN. Our journey to build a Smart Nation continues. In a recent Smart City Index by IMD Business School that measured how citizens perceived the scope and impact of efforts to make their cities ""smart"", Singapore was ranked first. This is a heartening outcome. We will strive to do even better and work with citizens and companies to deliver solutions that improve lives and enable business innovation."
elderly and children diagnosed with illnesses and health conditions due to malnutrition in recent years,"Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked the Minister for Health how many vulnerable persons, particularly the elderly and children below 18 years of age, have been diagnosed with illnesses and health conditions due to malnutrition in the last five years and what measures are in place to assist them.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: According to the 2017 Global Burden of Disease study, nutritional deficiencies such as protein-energy malnutrition, iodine, vitamin A and dietary iron deficiencies, accounted for less than 1% of the total disease burden in Singapore. Among Singaporeans less than 20 years of age, malnutrition accounted for about 4.5% of the disease burden in this age group. Based on data from health Promotion Board's (HPB) School Health Services in 2017, the prevalence of children in K1 and K2 who were underweight and severely underweight was 7.6%.As for older Singaporeans, a National University of Singapore study published in 2017 estimated the prevalence of under-nutrition among Singaporeans aged 55 and older at 2.8%. A study published in 2018 by the Centre for Ageing Research and Education, Duke-NUS Medical School, found that the prevalence of underweight in a nationally representative cohort of over 4,500 Singaporean residents aged 60 and above was 6.6%.MOH and HPB undertake efforts to encourage Singaporeans to eat healthily, such as raising the consumption of whole grains, fruits and vegetables, while reducing the in-take of trans fat, sugar and salt.  There are also specific efforts to address under-nutrition in children and seniors. For example, we have engaged maternity hospitals to implement WHO's Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative, which supports mothers in breastfeeding their infants as breast milk provides infants with all the essential nutrients for optimal growth and health. HPB has also introduced Healthy Meals programmes in pre-schools and mainstream schools. The programme enables children to have well-balanced meals and cultivate in them healthy eating habits. For families unable to afford basic living expenses, MSF's social service offices provide them with ComCare financial assistance, which cover their food expenses and other expenses. As part of the initiatives announced by the HealthySG taskforce, HPB will also be piloting a targeted programme with activities and incentives that are customised to the needs and circumstances of lower income families. For a start, HPB will focus on improving nutrition for these families. Examples of activities would include guided healthier eating trails, supermarket tours, cooking classes and nutrition workshops. For children from lower income families, the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) has partnered with KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH) to deliver the KidSTART Home Visitation Programme. ECDA will also be working with the National University Hospital (NUH) to extend the Programme to more children and their families. Through regular visits by ECDA and hospital home visitors, parents will receive support in acquiring skills and practical knowledge across areas of child development, health and nutrition.Under the National Seniors Health Programme, MOH and HPB also support seniors through community based education efforts such as regular health talks and cooking demonstrations. These help our seniors learn about the importance of a healthy balanced diet, as well as practical ways to incorporate key nutrients such as protein and calcium into their daily diet. In 2012, the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) introduced the Nutrition Movement to support our Community Care service providers in preparing and providing nutritious and tasty meals for seniors. The movement partners with professional chefs to deliver initiatives such as AIC's Culinary Training and Chef Partnership Programme. To date, more than 200 cooks from over 70 Community Care organisations have taken part in the Culinary Training initiative to improve their culinary capabilities and cooking standards. Activities include practical training on preparing normal and soft-textured meals, and demonstrations by professional chefs on nutritious meal preparation based on the recommendations by dietitians. In the community, AIC's Meals-On-Wheels programme, which delivers meals to homebound clients who may be unable to prepare their own meals, has also adopted HPB's Healthier Catering guidelines. We will continue to look at ways to support better nutrition for all Singaporeans.  "
education and outreach measures on hiv infections,Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked the Minister for Health (a) whether he can provide an update on the progress of the Ministry's education and outreach measures on HIV infections; (b) whether the Ministry has been able to detect more cases at an earlier stage and through voluntary testing; and (c) whether the Ministry has been able to help more cases delay the onset of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and what is the average duration of such delays.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Singapore's approach towards the prevention and control of HIV, is based on the four key principles of ""ABCD"". That is, ""A"" – abstinence from casual sex, ""B"" – being faithful, ""C"" correct and consistent use of condoms, and ""D"" – early detection and treatment.  The benefits of ""D"" or early detection and treatment of HIV infection are clear. It can suppress the HIV viral load and prevent the onset of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), thus enabling HIV-infected persons an improved quality and length of life that is relatively symptom-free. Based on our estimates, 77% of HIV-positive persons in Singapore know their status. Among those who know their status, 86% are on treatment. And 98% of those on treatment are virally suppressed.                  We have been working on efforts to encourage more at-risk persons to test for HIV regularly. Testing has been made widely accessible in primary care and hospital clinics. For persons who prefer anonymity, there are designated anonymous test sites at GP clinics as well as an Action for Aids mobile testing van operating at different sites. HPB also works with partner agencies on outreach programmes to encourage at-risk individuals to take preventive measures on HIV and to go for early and regular HIV testing. These include tapping on platforms such as World AIDS Day activities. We have made some progress through these efforts. The proportion of persons diagnosed with late-stage HIV infection decreased from 51% in the five-year period between 2009 to 2013 to 44% between 2014 and 2018. The proportion of new HIV-positive cases detected through voluntary testing increased from 14% from 2009 to 2013 to 19% between 2014 and 2018.We will continue to look into new and enhanced approaches and initiatives to encourage early and regular HIV testing among at-risk groups.              "
para sports in schools during physical education or character and citizenship education classes,Ms Yip Pin Xiu asked the Minister for Education whether he can consider including para sports as a basic experience across all schools in PE or Character and Citizenship Education.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: MOE promotes inclusive Physical Education (PE) and sports through multiple avenues. Para events have been introduced at the National School Games (NSG), in Swimming, Track and Field, Tenpin Bowling and most recently Shooting. These para events have attracted steady participation from our Special Education (SPED) Schools and mainstream schools annually.  MOE also supports Play Inclusive, a collaboration between Special Olympics Singapore and SportCares. During the inaugural event in 2018, 450 participants comprising athletes with intellectual disabilities partnered with students from mainstream schools to play badminton, basketball, football and floorball. The number of participants doubled in the 2019 edition. In addition, almost every mainstream school is currently resourced with a teacher trained in Inclusive PE to enable all students with varying abilities to enjoy physical activities and sports together. Through these activities, students gain a better understanding of each other, including those with special needs.We will continue to explore ways that meaningfully meet the needs of our diverse profile of students, while helping them appreciate those with different abilities. But like many other meritorious topics, from climate change, computer coding, social equity to financial literacy, MOE will take great care before introducing them as compulsory subjects or activities. We can engage students in these topics through existing school lessons or activities, in an organic and interactive way, which can be more effective.                "
monthly average number of appeals to traffic police made by members of parliament on behalf of residents,"Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) in the last two years, what is the monthly average number of appeals to Traffic Police made by Members of Parliament on behalf of their constituents; (b) what is the percentage of successful appeals for waiver of fines or demerit points; and (c) what assistance is provided to the appellants when they are unable to pay the fines or when their driving licences, which are needed for their livelihood, are suspended.","Mr K Shanmugam: In 2017 and 2018, the Traffic Police received about 350 appeals per month from Members of Parliament on behalf of their constituents. Traffic Police waived the fines or demerit points in about 3% of the appeals.Motorists who flout traffic rules put themselves and other road users at risk. To ensure that our roads are safe for everyone, Traffic Police applies the traffic rules consistently for all motorists. Appeals for the waiver of fines or demerit points are considered only if the motorist can show proof that traffic rules were breached during a medical emergency. In cases of financial hardship, the appellant will need to request for general financial assistance from other Government schemes, where the appellant qualifies."
impact of community disputes resolution act on number of disputes between neighbours,Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for National Development whether the number of disputes between neighbours living in HDB flats in the past four years has fallen after the Community Disputes Resolution Act came into effect.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB does not comprehensively track the figures of neighbourly disputes in HDB flats. In any case, it is not clear why there should be a link between the number of disputes happening in any year with the establishment of the Community Disputes Resolution Act. Whenever HDB receives a report of a neighbourly dispute, it will first encourage the neighbours to resolve their disagreements amicably between themselves, or seek the assistance of grassroots and community leaders to provide informal mediation.  If the dispute continues, HDB will suggest to the residents involved to seek voluntary mediation at the Community Mediation Centre, or to take the matter to the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals (CDRT) as a last resort. In that sense, the CDRT is not meant to deter or reduce the number of disputes, but to provide a way to resolve longstanding neighbour issues."
penalties for wilful obstruction of emergency vehicles,"Mr Yee Chia Hsing asked the Minister for Home Affairs what are the current penalties for wilful obstruction of emergency vehicles, such as ambulances and fire engine trucks, and whether the penalties can be raised.","Mr K Shanmugam: Under the Road Traffic Act, it is an offence for motorists to obstruct emergency vehicles that are responding to an emergency. The composition sums for this offence were recently increased on 1 April 2019. It was raised from $130 to $150 for light vehicles, and from $160 to $200 for heavy vehicles. Offenders will also receive four demerit points. In cases where there are aggravating factors, Traffic Police will prosecute offenders in Court. First-time offenders can be fined up to $1,000 or imprisoned up to three months, or both. Repeat offenders can be fined up to $2,000 or imprisoned up to six months, or both.The number of reported violations has generally been low. As the composition sums for failing to give way to emergency vehicles were recently increased, we will monitor the situation and consider further action where necessary."
construction of designated cycling paths in bukit panjang town,Dr Teo Ho Pin asked the Minister for Transport whether he can provide a progress update on the construction of designated cycling paths in Bukit Panjang Town.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: We plan to build 7 km of cycling paths in Bukit Panjang Town and to complete it by 2021. The project is on track. We will complete 5 km next year, and the remaining 2 km in 2021.By next year, residents living along Bukit Panjang Ring Road, Pending Road, Fajar Road, Jelapang Road, Saujana Road and Jelebu Road will be connected to key transport nodes and amenities like the LRT stations, Bukit Panjang town centre, supermarkets, polyclinic, eateries and malls. The cycling path network will be extended to cover Senja Road and Petir Road by 2021."
conventional credit assessment method for bank loans,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Prime Minister whether the policy and guiding principles for bank loans based on conventional credit assessment methodology will be reviewed and updated to be relevant to changing business models.,"Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): MAS' regulations and guidelines pertaining to banks seek to ensure that they make sound lending decisions, which support resilient and sustainable financing of our economy and the markets that they serve abroad. Big data analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) are opening up new avenues for lenders to improve their risk management, as well as improve outcomes for customers across a range of business activities. The availability of unconventional data sources, such as customers' near real-time cashflows, transaction and payments data patterns, could potentially lead to better insights on customer preferences, behaviour, and credit worthiness. Such insights could benefit customers themselves, by allowing banks to provide better tailored and useful services. For example, they could lead to more differentiated pricing benefiting customers with strong credit standing, or greater availability of credit to previously under-served segments of the market.But the core principles of credit risk management that underpin MAS' regulations remain relevant. Proper governance and oversight, robust risk models and methodologies, independent credit assessments and reviews are some of these fundamental supervisory requirements. However, new lending practices that rely heavily on unconventional data sources or artificial intelligence do come with specific risks that banks have to address. The use of inaccurate or non-representative data could result in wrong lending decisions or pricing and unintentional biases. AI algorithms that determine lending decisions may also be harder to validate for accuracy relative to more established lending processes. To promote the responsible use of AI and data analytics, MAS has co-developed with the financial industry a set of principles to promote fairness, ethics, accountability and transparency in the provision of financial products and services (FEAT Principles). Through these FEAT Principles, MAS is working with financial firms to strengthen internal governance around data management and use. MAS expects financial firms to put in place robust data and model governance frameworks and processes that support transparency and auditability, so that data-driven or AI models can be explained, understood and monitored, and be subject to regular reviews and validation. Financial firms are also expected to ensure that the use of AI and data analytics continues to be aligned with their corporate ethical standards and codes of conduct. We are closely monitoring these developments in technology and business models. MAS will continue to proactively refine and adapt its regulatory and supervisory approach in a way that promotes innovation while safeguarding public confidence in our financial sector."
subsidy on treated water supplied to malaysia,"Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether the Government tracks the amount of subsidies given to Malaysia for the supply of treated water every year; and (b) if so, what is the estimated amount of subsidies given to Malaysia since the Government started such tracking.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Under the 1962 Water Agreement, Johor is entitled to buy treated water of up to two percent of the total quantity of water we import to Singapore on any given day, or about five million gallons of water per day based on the 250 million gallons of water we draw from the Johor River per day. The treated water is sold to Johor and at the stipulated price of 50 Malaysian sens per thousand gallons. Both Singapore and Malaysia must comply fully with the 1962 Water Agreement and neither can unilaterally change the terms of the Agreement, including the prices of raw and treated water.  As the Member has rightly pointed out, we are subsidising treated water sold to Malaysia. The treated water price of 50 Malaysian sens per thousand gallons is only a fraction of the cost to Singapore of treating water at the Johor River Waterworks and supplying it to Malaysia, which was Malaysian Ringgit 2.40 per thousand gallons in 1997. The exact subsidies have varied over time as our cost has increased over the past 20 years due to factors such as the higher cost of materials and energy. We are, however, unable to share the amount of subsidies that have been provided over time.  At Malaysia's request, Singapore has been regularly supplying Johor with 16 million gallons per day, and up to 22 million gallons per day at times, of treated water. This is beyond Johor's entitlement of five million gallons of water per day under the 1962 Water Agreement. All treated water supplied to Johor is sold at the same price of 50 Malaysian sens per thousand gallons, without prejudice to our rights under the 1962 Water Agreement. We do so out of goodwill and in the spirit of good neighbourliness."
manufacturers’ information on recycling classification on product packages,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether there are plans to request manufacturers to provide information to consumers on the recycling classification of their product packages or by displaying marks on their packaging to increase public awareness on how to recycle.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: We currently have no plans to require manufacturers to provide consumers with the recycling classification of their product packaging or to display such labels on their packaging. In countries that require consumers to sort and segregate their recyclables, recycling labels are useful to inform consumers of the material that the packaging is made of. Consumers are then able to deposit the packaging in the appropriate recycling bin.However, Singapore adopts a commingled approach for the collection of household recyclables under the National Recycling Programme. The public does not need to sort their recyclables according to material type. All recyclables are collected in the same bin and transported to material recovery facilities where they are sorted, baled and sent for recycling. The commingled approach makes recycling more convenient for the public, takes up less space and facilitates more efficient collection of recyclables.My Ministry and NEA will continue to work closely with all stakeholders to raise public awareness on recycling, including exploring the possibility of displaying recycling labels on packaging. We launched the #RecycleRight movement to encourage Singaporeans to recycle right. The key is to avoid contamination of recyclables through food waste and liquids. We also rolled out a redesigned recycling label for our blue commingled bins to clearly indicate examples of what can and cannot be recycled. "
impact of british inventor's announcement to drop electric car project in singapore,Mr Seah Kian Peng asked the Minister for Trade and Industry what is the impact of Dyson's sudden announcement of closure of its automative division in Singapore and how will the previous investment commitments by the company be honoured.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: Dyson's decision to wind down its electric vehicle business will not impact its presence and operations in Singapore. Out of Dyson's 1,200-strong workforce in Singapore, 20 employees are from their electric vehicle business. Dyson will redeploy the affected employees within the organisation.Although Dyson will no longer pursue its electric vehicle business, it will continue to grow its core business in Singapore, develop battery technology for consumer products and expand R&D in areas such as sensors, robotics and artificial intelligence, which will also support the development of a smart mobility eco-system.Other companies have also expressed interest in developing smart mobility solutions in Singapore. They value our highly skilled workforce, strengths in advanced technologies such as robotics and automation, and strong intellectual property protection regime. We will continue to work with these companies to harness these opportunities for Singapore."
cross-agency collaboration for evaluation of design for covered footpaths,Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for National Development whether the Municipal Services Office will work with other agencies to evaluate the design of covered footpaths with the view of widening the footpaths.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: LTA, URA, HDB and other stakeholder agencies have drawn up a common set of Walking and Cycling Design Guidelines to help industry and Government agencies improve urban street design for commuters. The guidelines, which have been in place since 1 February 2019, describe the recommended design and width of covered linkways and their associated footpaths.  Newer covered linkways generally conform to these recommended specifications.Older covered linkways built before these harmonised guidelines may not conform to these specifications. Where needed, and where there are no site constraints, MSO works with the relevant agencies to consider the cost-effectiveness of widening the covered linkway and its associated footpath.I thank Mr Lim for his feedback, which helps us improve our shared living environment.  "
improving connectivity from private estates to public transport nodes to encourage more go car-lite,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling asked the Minister for Transport (a) how can the connectivity from private estates to public transport nodes be improved as citizens are encouraged to go car-lite and more seniors are not driving due to old age; and (b) what are the short- to mid-term plans that can be implemented.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: We are committed to ensuring that there are adequate public bus services for both public and private residential estates, subject to a minimum level of ridership. We work closely with the local Members of Parliament and grassroots leaders to better understand commuters’ need when planning bus services throughout Singapore.Today, around 20% of our bus services serve private estates. The bus services that ply through private estates take routes that serve the largest number of residents. While we try to provide better coverage to the estates, it is not always possible to serve every corner. We seek the Member's understanding."
hands-on community activities for singapore students on overseas cultural immersion trips,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Education whether the overseas cultural immersions for students can include hands-on activities by which the students can meaningfully contribute to the communities there.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: As part of the efforts to help our youth develop 21st Century competencies, schools organise overseas trips every year aimed to expand our students in areas like cultural enrichment, language immersion and education in history or geography. Depending on the objectives of the visit, community projects may be included as part of the trip. Where appropriate, schools could have our youths conduct English and Mathematics lessons for the local children, paint the walls in the school or refurbish the library. In the process, we hope our students develop a sense of empathy as they learn about the life of their peers in the countries they visit and draw lessons from the tenacity and resilience of these communities."
number of hybrid and fully electric cars registered in singapore,"Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar asked the Minister for Transport (a) how many hybrid cars and fully electric cars are registered currently; and (b) whether there are plans to convert all taxis, private hire vehicles and public buses to hybrid or fully electric vehicles.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: There are currently 34,000 hybrid and 1,000 fully electric cars registered in Singapore.Under the Land Transport Master Plan 2040, we have articulated a vision to have all taxis, private hire cars and public buses be hybrid or fully electric by 2040. As for existing vehicles, it is for the owners to decide if they wish to switch.   We understand that all taxi companies and some private hire car booking providers and car rental companies have committed to having 100% cleaner fleets by 2040."
subsidies for school bus services,"Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Education whether there are subsidies for school bus services, especially where a family has multiple children attending school.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: The MOE Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS) provides financial support for Singapore Citizen (SC) students from lower income families in our Primary schools, Secondary schools and Junior Colleges. For Primary and Secondary schools, the FAS covers school and miscellaneous fees, textbooks, uniforms, meals and transport expenses, including a 50% subsidy of school bus charges.  As FAS is provided on a per child basis, families with more children are not disadvantaged nor adversely affected."
patients showing resistance to antibiotics in recent years,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Health (a) how many patients have shown resistance to antibiotics over the last three years; (b) what are the profiles of these patients; and (c) what measures are being implemented in 2019 to educate target groups about the correct use of antibiotics.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Antimicrobial resistance or ""AMR"" is a commonly occurring phenomenon, where microorganisms change and develop resistance after being exposed to antimicrobial drugs.  However, the excessive and inappropriate use of antimicrobials has exacerbated its development. Today, AMR has been observed across a range of diseases, from common respiratory and urinary tract infections, to more serious diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria and sexually transmitted diseases like syphilis. Treatment for resistant infections often involves newer generation drugs that are usually more expensive, require longer duration of treatment or lengthier stay in hospitals, and sometimes with potentially more side effects.  AMR in the community such as those treated in the GP setting is not centrally tracked. In our public hospitals, AMR is monitored through indicators on infection by the bacteria, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or ""MRSA"" – a resistant infection common in the hospital setting, and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae or ""CPE"" – a more recent form of antimicrobial resistance of emerging concern globally. The infection rate of MRSA has dropped from 17.6 per 10,000 inpatient days in 2011, to 10.6 per 10,000 inpatient days in 2018. Between 2015 and 2018, CPE infection rates here have hovered around 0.9 per 10,000 patient days per year.  Individuals with weakened immune systems and those who require invasive procedures or medical devices are more vulnerable to AMR infections. A study of patients in public hospitals infected with CPE found that the median age was 66 years old and many had chronic diseases such as diabetes or heart disease. AMR is often exacerbated by the inappropriate and overuse of antibiotics. About three quarters of these patients had used antibiotics in the preceding 30 days. Antibiotics should only be prescribed when necessary. Antimicrobial Stewardship Programmes have been implemented in all public hospitals since 2011 to guide doctors on appropriate antibiotic use, so as to slow down the emergence of AMR. Recognising that a long-term multi-prong approach is necessary to address AMR, the National Strategic Action Plan was launched in 2017, to reduce and prevent the spread of AMR through the five key pillars of (i) Education; (ii) Surveillance; (iii) Infection Prevention and Control; (iv) Optimisation of Antimicrobial Use; and (v) Research. Under the pillars of Education and Optimisation of Antimicrobial Use, the National Centre for Infectious Diseases is working on professional education efforts, such as training programmes and guidelines on the management of infections and antimicrobial use. Patients too have an important role to play in the appropriate use of antibiotics. In 2018, the Health Promotion Board launched the annual ""Use Antibiotics Right"" public education campaign to address the general public misperception that antibiotics are needed for minor ailments, such as the common cold or flu, and to encourage patients to discuss with their doctors the necessity for antibiotic use. Patients are also reminded to follow the instructions given by their doctors on their prescribed antibiotics.We will continue to work with all stakeholders to tackle AMR as everyone has a part to play. "
number of frail patients who do not show up for follow-up treatment at specialist clinics despite polyclinic referrals,"Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling asked the Minister for Health (a) since 2010, what is the number of frail patients who have not showed up for follow-up treatment at specialist clinics after polyclinic referrals; (b) what are the reasons that these patients are not attending the follow-up treatment; (c) how can the Ministry or agencies assist in improving the situation; and (d) what are the longer term plans for geriatric care in the heartlands.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: About 12% to 20% of patients aged 65 and older do not show up for their SOC appointments despite alerts and reminders by the hospital or polyclinics. Based on surveys conducted by public hospitals, the main reasons for not attending SOC appointments include improvement in the patient’s medical condition, the patient having sought other treatments or treatments at other healthcare providers, the patient or care-giver not being well enough to attend, the patient had forgotten about or decided not to proceed with their appointments.Other than alerts and reminders to the patients or their nominated caregivers, MOH has put in place the Medical Escort and Transport scheme to accompany and assist frail patients from their homes for their medical appointments at SOC or polyclinic and back. At hospitals and polyclinics, staff are trained to identify and assist frail patients when they arrive for appointments, for example providing wheelchairs and wheelchair assistance if needed. In cases where a patient has multiple SOC appointments, hospitals may help consolidate his or her appointments to reduce the number of visits needed.As our goal is to enable seniors to age-in-place, we have also put in place measures to support frail seniors and their caregivers by enhancing the accessibility, quality and affordability of care options in the community. For example, the Silver Generation Office (SGO) reaches out to seniors through its volunteers, the Silver Generation Ambassadors (SGAs). When needed, SGAs connect seniors to health and social care services through the Community Network for Seniors (CNS). CNS then works various healthcare and community partners to coordinate care services for the seniors, including ensuring seniors receive medical follow-up in a timely manner.MOH will continue to expand care options in the community and work with the public hospitals, polyclinics and community providers to assist frail patients to access medical care.         "
new timeline to complete construction of johor-singapore rapid transit system,"Mr Ang Wei Neng asked the Minister for Transport in light that the suspension of the decision to construct the Johor-Singapore Rapid Transit System (RTS) ends on 31 October 2019 (a) whether Malaysia has agreed to proceed with the construction of the RTS; and (b) if so, what will be the estimated new timeline to complete the construction of the RTS.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: On 21 May 2019, Singapore and Malaysia signed a Supplemental Agreement to suspend the construction of the Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System (RTS) Link Project up to 30 September 2019. Malaysia had requested the suspension, to give them time to study ways to reduce the project cost. While the RTS Link Bilateral Agreement makes no provision for a suspension, in the spirit of bilateral cooperation, Singapore agreed to Malaysia’s request. On 20 September 2019, Singapore received Malaysia’s request for an extension of the suspension period to 31 October 2019. Singapore agreed to Malaysia's request. On 21 October 2019, Malaysia conveyed to Singapore that they intend to proceed with the RTS Link Project with some changes. Malaysia was however not yet ready to share the details of their proposed changes with Singapore. Without the details, Malaysia's proposal is incomplete and Singapore is unable to make a thorough assessment of the technical and commercial feasibility of the proposal. On 29 October 2019, Malaysia requested a further extension of the suspension period by six months to 30 April 2020. In the spirit of bilateral cooperation, Singapore agreed to Malaysia's request to further extend the suspension period.  Singapore welcomes Malaysia’s decision to proceed with the RTS Link Project. This is a mutually beneficial Project for both countries. The RTS Link will significantly ease Causeway congestion, facilitate business and tourism, and bring our people closer together. While we are not obliged to accept Malaysia’s proposed changes, we will continue to keep an open mind and assess them carefully and objectively. Both sides are currently discussing the changes to the Project, which will require amendments to the RTS Link Bilateral Agreement. Apart from the re-stated Bilateral Agreement, two other agreements will need to be signed at the same time by the end of the suspension period. They are the Joint Venture Agreement between Singapore's SMRT Corporation and Malaysia's Prasarana Malaysia Berhad to constitute a joint venture Operating Company or ""OpCo"", and a Concession Agreement for the Singapore and Malaysian Governments to appoint this OpCo as the RTS Link operator. The discussions swill take some time, and both sides are working hard on this.              "
use of photographs or video recordings of high-rise littering and feeding of pigeons to prosecute perpetrators,"Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether photographs or video recordings of high-rise littering and feeding of pigeons be used to prosecute perpetrators; and (b) if so, how can the Ministry work with the community and law enforcement agencies to bring more culprits to task.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: NEA deploys surveillance cameras with video analytics to catch high-rise littering offenders. These cameras have helped improve NEA's enforcement efforts, leading to more than 2,200 offenders being caught since deployments began in 2012. NParks similarly installs cameras and conducts surveillance at identified feeding hotspots to curb pigeon feeding. It also works with Town Councils to put up notices to solicit information about feeding activities in order to carry out targeted enforcement operations.Members of the public can submit photos and video-recordings of high-rise littering and pigeon feeding incidents to NEA and NParks respectively to aid the agencies’ investigations and enable more targeted enforcement operations against such offences. While there are laws against high-rise littering and pigeon feeding, it is more important that we foster collective responsibility for our environment and cultivate positive social norms. To this end, NEA works closely with grassroots leaders and community organisations to address feedback and raise awareness among residents by distributing advisories against high-rise littering during home visits and promoting graciousness and civic-mindedness at community events. It also collaborates with the Public Hygiene Council and partners of the nationwide ""Keep Singapore Clean"" movement to inculcate the habit of keeping our homes and neighbourhoods clean. NParks and the Town Councils have also been working together to educate residents about the issues caused by pigeon feeding through advisories, posters, and outreach events. The Government will continue to enforce against high-rise littering and curb pigeon feeding, but we cannot do it alone. Every one of us must do our part to keep Singapore a clean, green, and sustainable home for our future generations."
number of cpf account holders who have exhausted personal medisave funds over last 10 years,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Health (a) in each of the last 10 years, how many CPF account holders have exhausted their personal MediSave funds and managed to have support from immediate family members' MediSave for their medical treatment; and (b) how many have also exhausted their family members' MediSave funds or who have no family members to turn to and help has been given through MediFund.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: In recent years, the Government has introduced a range of initiatives to help Singaporeans save for their healthcare needs. For example, we provide GSTV MediSave top-ups of up to $450 each year to Singapore citizens aged 65 years and above. Eligible seniors also receive annual MediSave top-ups of between $200 and $800 under the Pioneer Generation Package, and MediSave top-ups of $200 for five years between 2019 and 2023 under the Merdeka Generation Package.Singaporeans can tap on their family members' MediSave to pay for their healthcare expenses, and do not need to exhaust their own MediSave accounts before doing so. The number of CPF members with MediSave balances of less than $100 and tapped on their family members' MediSave for their medical treatment is about 2% of all CPF members who utilised MediSave each year between 2016 and 2018.MediFund is a safety net for patients who face financial difficulties with their medical bills after Government subsidies, MediShield Life and MediSave. Independent MediFund Committees consider each case holistically taking into consideration patients' circumstances, and patients are not required to fully exhaust their own or their family members' MediSave. As such, we do not track the number of Singaporeans who have received MediFund assistance because they have exhausted family members' MediSave or who have no family members.   "
enhancing road safety for elderly pedestrians with public education,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) how is the Ministry raising awareness amongst our elderly to use pedestrian crossings and refrain from jaywalking; and (b) how is the Ministry strengthening public education and outreach efforts to the motorcycling community to pay greater attention to elderly pedestrians.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The Traffic Police regularly engages the elderly at places they frequent, such as Senior Activity Centres, to raise their awareness on road safety by highlighting the common causes of accidents and the dangers of jaywalking.The Traffic Police also partners the Singapore Road Safety Council and its community partners to organise regular road safety events to engage the elderly. This includes the recent Road Safety Carnival for Seniors held on 12 October 2019. They also conduct road safety outreach efforts to raise awareness among motorists, including motorcyclists, to look out for pedestrians, especially when driving in the Silver Zones. These include road safety messages which are disseminated island-wide, and the ""Use Your RoadSense"" movement which aims to build a culture of road-safe behaviour. Specifically for motorcyclists, there is the annual Singapore Ride Safe campaign to promote good road sense and riding behaviour."
take-up rate for dementia day care services,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Health (a) how many Singaporeans are currently utilising dementia day care services; (b) what is the existing ratio of capacity to demand; and (c) whether there are plans to also subsidise transportation costs to the day care centres.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: As at end June 2019, dementia day care centres across the island had capacity to serve up to 3,400 clients each day. At the same time, there were about 3,100 Singaporeans utilising dementia day care1. Some may not attend day care every day, depending on their individual care arrangements.  MOH provides means-tested subsidies for transport to and from dementia day care centres for eligible clients. This includes subsidies for centre-owned transport services, taxi services or private-hire car services where appropriate.  MOH will continue to monitor the demand for dementia day care services and support seniors and care-givers to receive the care they require.               "
higher cost of monthly student concession pass covering travel on trains and buses,Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for Transport why does the hybrid monthly student concession pass that covers both MRT trains and buses cost significantly more than a solely bus or MRT train monthly concession pass for a student.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: In Singapore, students enjoy significant concessions when travelling on public transport. Depending on their travelling habits, students can choose the concession option that best benefits them.If they seldom mix their modes of travel, taking only buses or trains most of the time, they may, for instance choose the single-mode concession passes at $27.50 per month for buses or $25 for trains, if they are Secondary school students. Otherwise, they may choose the hybrid student pass which provides them with unlimited rides on both buses and trains. The latter, at $51 per month, is priced higher in return for full flexibility.The student concession passes are significantly cheaper than the adult hybrid pass which is priced at $120 per month. As the concessions are funded by other commuters, further discounts will lead to higher fares for other commuter groups or a heavier burden on taxpayers.    "
subsidy for replacement of fire-rated main doors for hdb flats,"Ms Tin Pei Ling asked the Minister for National Development for HDB flats owners who are required to have fire-rated main doors and wish to replace them, whether the Ministry will consider offering these owners the same amount of subsidy as those owners who choose to replace their main doors with non-fire rated ones under the Home Improvement Programme to ensure equitability.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Since 1996, the Fire Code has required the main doors of selected HDB flats, such as those which face fire escape routes, to be fire-rated. All flats built by HDB since then have been provided with fire-rated main doors, where required. For flats built prior to 1996, HDB had carried out a one-off door replacement exercise for those which needed fire-rated main doors to comply with the Fire Code, at no cost to residents.  As the units with fire-rated doors have already enjoyed a free replacement of doors by HDB, HDB will not provide any further subsidy for the replacement of these doors during the Home Improvement Programme."
reach of hpb's workplace mental health solution initiative,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Health (a) how successful has HPB's Workplace Mental Health Solution initiative been since its launch in 2012; (b) what other funding support has been given to encourage companies to roll out mental wellness programmes at the workplace; and (c) how many working professionals have utilised HPB's Talk2Us helpline to seek help in managing workplace-related stress.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Health Promotion Board's (HPB) Workplace Mental Health Solution initiative supports mental well-being programmes and resources at workplaces.For example, a one-day on-site management training workshop helps equip managers and human resource personnel with knowledge to be supportive leaders at their workplaces. Two half-day workshops are also available to provide skills to those supporting others at work, and developing and implementing workplace mental health programmes. Close to 1,400 managers and HR personnel have benefited from these programmes since 2017.HPB also partners landlords and developers to bring mental well-being talks and workshops on-site. Small and medium enterprises can choose from a list of co-funded mental well-being activities for implementation. There are also health coaching programmes which incorporate mental health tips for shift workers in sectors, such as retail, F&B and cleaning. In 2018, 9,500 workers benefited from these mental well-being activities.In addition, HPB runs Talk2US. This is a free and confidential helpline to support working adults with workplace-related stress. Talk2US has helped over 460 employees in 2018."
expected fare revenue increase for public transport operators from commuters fare hike and impact on operators' service delivery,Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Transport whether the expected increase in fare revenue for MRT operators amounting to $132.5 million a year arising from the fee hike announced by the Public Transport Council to deal with the cost pressures highlighted by the operators in their applications to the Public Transport Authority is sufficient to ensure that there will be no performance degradation by these operators.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: There are existing mechanisms in place to guard against performance degradation. Rail services are regulated through operating licences, which set out the minimum performance standards, while bus operators are contractually required to meet service standards.The Government will continue to invest significant resources to support a reliable and high quality public transport system, while keeping fares affordable for all. Over the next five years, the Government expects to put in close to $1 billion to renew rail operating assets, and another $1 billion to subsidise bus operations every year. The heavy subsidies by Government, together with the estimated increase in fare revenue of $132.5 million from the 2019 Fare Review Exercise, will help sustain public transport service levels for both bus and rail."
improvement of quality of standards for buses under bus contracting model,"Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether under the Bus Contracting Model, the Quality of Service (QoS) standards for bus services, particularly with respect to scheduled headway during peak hours, have improved; and (b) how is technology leveraged upon to monitor the bus services' operating and quality of service performance standards regularly.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Commuters have enjoyed higher service levels, in particular during peak hours, since the transition to the Bus Contracting Model (BCM) in September 2016. All trunk bus services are now scheduled at headways of 15 minutes or less during the morning and evening peak periods, compared to the pre-BCM standard of 30 minutes or less.Peak-hour service levels of feeder services have also improved. All feeder services now have scheduled headways of not more than eight minutes, compared to the pre-BCM standard of not more than 10 minutes for at least 90% of feeder services.LTA regularly monitors bus operations and service performance by tapping on commuter travel data from the fare ticketing system, and bus GPS data from the Common Fleet Management System (CFMS). LTA uses these data to adjust bus capacities in tandem with demand changes, to ensure that bus services keep to the standards. "
average waiting times for appointments for subsidised mental health therapy and counselling at public hospitals,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Health what are the average waiting times and waiting time range for patients to get an appointment for subsidised mental health therapy and counselling treatment at public hospitals.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: In our public hospitals, mental health therapy and counselling are provided at Specialist Outpatient Clinics. Between 2017 and 2018, the overall median waiting time for new subsidised psychiatrist appointments across the public hospitals ranged from 24 days to 27 days. Patients whose conditions are more severe or who require more urgent attention are given earlier appointments. Other than referrals to Specialist Outpatient Clinics, under the Community Mental Health (CMH) Masterplan, we are strengthening primary and community-based care and support for those with stable mental health conditions.MOH will continue to work with public hospitals and service providers in the community, including schools, social service agencies and family service centres, to ensure that we provide holistic and timely support for persons with mental healthcare needs.  "
studies on workplace bullying in singapore,Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for Manpower whether local or independent studies or surveys have been carried out on workplace bullying in Singapore in light of the findings of the inaugural Kantar Inclusion Index.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: Based on a MOM survey conducted in 2018, 2.4% of Singapore's resident labour force reported having personally experienced bullying or harassment in their workplace1. The MOM survey’s definition of bullying and harassment was specific. It asked respondents to recall actual incidents where they were subjected to verbal abuse, threats or assault during the course of their work. MOM's survey adopts a similar methodology used in the European Working Conditions Survey, where the corresponding figure for Italy is 3.0% and Spain is 3.2%, for instance. The average among European countries is 5.7%2. In Canada, the average incidence of employees experiencing threats, violence and harassment is similarly low3.Kantar's study was based only on results from 14 countries, but claimed that 19% of employees from around the world have been ""bullied, undermined, or harassed"", compared to 20% in Canada, and 24% in Singapore. It also claimed that Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain fared better but did not offer statistics for comparison.  Notably, the Kantar press release conflated bullying, harassment, and being ""undermined"". This possibly explains the large gap between their reported figures and the official statistics that were just cited. Various media outlets that reported off the Kantar press release thus presented the same skewed picture. We would caution readers to exercise judgement when reading such reports or indices.We take a serious stance towards workplace bullying or harassment, against which we have stringent criminal laws. For example, the sending of unwarranted lewd messages to co-workers with intent to cause harassment, alarm or distress, would be a criminal offence under the Protection from Harassment Act. The Police can investigate such cases. If the workplace bullying amounts to criminal intimidation or involves physical violence, the Police can also take action under the Penal Code.At MOM's Committee of Supply debate this year, we announced that the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) would be a help and resource centre for workplace harassment for both employees and employers. Since our announcement earlier this year, TAFEP has received 27 cases4 relating to workplace harassment. For these cases, employers have taken the necessary corrective measures upon advice from TAFEP. TAFEP has also provided support to complainants and advised on their options, such as making a police report or seeking civil remedies. We urge individuals who face harassment at the workplace to call TAFEP at 6838 0969 or write to TAFEP for advice and assistance.                   "
causes for contamination of ranitidine medicines,Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the cause of the contamination of ranitidine medicines has been identified; (b) what measures have been put in place to advise patients who have the drug to stop using them; and (c) whether there will be any compensation for replacement of these medicines.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: On 16 September 2019, the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) stopped the sale and supply of eight brands of ranitidine medicines at clinics, hospitals and pharmacies. HSA tested all rantidine medicines supplied in Singapore when it was alerted that a nitrosamine impurity, N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), might be present in these products. The recall was initiated as a precautionary measure following the detection of trace amounts of NDMA above 96 ng per day. This is the internationally acceptable level of what was reasonably safe if a patient takes the affected medicine every day continuously for a lifetime of 70 years.  Ranitidine is used to reduce the production of acid in the stomach in conditions such as heartburn and gastric ulcers. As it is generally prescribed for short-term use of a few days to a few weeks, the potential additional cancer risk of nitrosamines is assessed to be very low (0.00003%). Nonetheless, HSA instituted a recall of the affected products to limit patients' further exposure to these products. Patients who are concerned about the use of the affected ranitidine medicines should contact their doctor. Subsequently, Canada, Switzerland and the US undertook recalls between 17 and 24 September. All the recalls were also at the retail level. So, too, was the global recall by Sandoz on 17 September.The root cause of nitrosamines in ranitidine medicines has yet to be established. HSA and international regulatory agencies are working with the companies supplying ranitidine medicines to identify the root causes of the contamination and to formulate the necessary measures to address the issue.To ensure the quality of our medicines, companies that import new batches of ranitidine are required to test their products to ensure that they do not contain nitrosamine impurities above the internationally acceptable level before supplying them in Singapore. "
impact of increase in public transport fares on amount of vouchers given out and on financial sustainability of public transport operators,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Transport in light of the Public Transport Council's announcement of a fare increase of up to 7% in the 2019 fare review exercise (a) whether the Ministry intends to increase the quantum to be disbursed in the 2019 public transport voucher exercise; and (b) how does LTA ensure the financial sustainability of our public transport without degrading service standards when fare adjustments are not in tandem with the cost of operation.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The Public Transport Council (PTC)'s fare formula was designed to keep fares in line with macroeconomic cost factors, such as inflation, wages, fuel, and network capacity increases, together with a productivity extraction. However, as I had explained in July this year, the fare adjustments were not fully implemented for many years, contributing to substantial losses by the public transport operators, and resulting in increased Government subsidies. We cannot keep adding to taxpayers' burden, since every dollar spent on public transport subsidies is a dollar less for other national priorities like education and healthcare. The operators cannot sustain losses without performance degradation. As responsible employers, they also need to ensure that their workers' livelihoods are not affected. For all these reasons, we must keep our costs in check and set fares at the right level. The PTC will ensure fares remain affordable for all. Our public transport fares are among the most affordable in the world, especially for concession groups such as students and seniors. One in two Singaporeans enjoys concessionary fares with a discount as high as 70% of adult fares.In addition, the Government will step in to cushion the impact of the fare adjustment on lower income households. For example, for the 2018 Fare Review Exercise, the Government made available 300,000 Public Transport Vouchers (PTVs) worth $30 each. This is the largest PTV Exercise to date.               "
selection criteria applied to smes for scale-up sg initiative,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what are the key criteria for SMEs to be selected for the Scale-up SG initiative; and (b) what is the likely number of companies that will benefit from this programme over the next 24 months.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: Scale-up SG supports local companies with high growth potential to develop into global or regional leaders in their respective sectors. Participating companies go through a 2.5-year programme together with Enterprise Singapore and other programme partners. We support the companies in management development, business innovation, market penetration and other areas that will help to accelerate their growth.As the process is resource-intensive, we choose the participating companies carefully. Besides a high level of commitment from the founders and CEOs to embark on an ambitious growth plan, ESG also looks at the company's track record; the commitment to grow its presence in Singapore, especially headquarters and management control functions; and the potential to create economic spin-offs for Singapore and create good jobs for Singaporeans. Scale-up SG was launched in July 2019 with 25 companies from various industries in the first two cohorts. Examples of companies include JUMBO Group from the food and beverage sector, AEM Holdings from the advanced manufacturing sector, Chye Thiam Maintenance from the cleaning and waste management sector, and Health Management International from the healthcare sector. Enterprise Singapore plans for another four to six cohorts to embark on the Scale-up SG programme over the next two years, with each cohort comprising 10 to 15 companies."
non-legally trained persons providing advice for drafting of wills,"Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling asked the Minister for Law (a) whether the Ministry has statistics regarding organisations or non-legally trained individuals who are advising clients on the drafting of wills; and (b) whether the Ministry intends to restrict, supervise or regulate non-lawyers and organisations that are not legally trained from dealing with the business of will drafting.","Mr K Shanmugam: Will-writing services are not restricted solely to lawyers and are not a regulated activity under the Legal Profession Act1. This accords with the approach in other jurisdictions such as Britain. People who wish to make a will have a range of choices. They may write the will themselves, or seek the help of a will-writing service provider. Those who envisage their assets being distributed or managed in a complex manner can engage a lawyer to assist with drafting the will. The Legal Aid Bureau also offers legal assistance in the drafting of wills to Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents of limited means. We do not maintain statistics on the provision of will-writing services.We encourage the public to deposit information on their wills with the Wills Registry, which is a confidential registry maintained by the Public Trustee. Doing so will make it easier to locate the will in future.  "
hdb rental flat applicants who have exceeded income eligibility ceiling,"Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for National Development over the past five years, how many successful HDB rental flat applicants have exceeded the income eligibility threshold of $1,500.","29 Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for National Development how many applications to rent HDB flats under the Public Rental Scheme have been rejected because the applicants have exceeded the household income ceiling in the three years before the change in policy to make the criteria more flexible.Mr Lawrence Wong: For some time now, HDB has been taking a needs-based approach in assessing requests for public rental flats. HDB will evaluate each application holistically, taking into account factors such as household income, and whether the applicants have other housing options and family support.  This approach is not new. MND has stated this in Parliament previously and highlighted that HDB will assist those in need with a public rental flat even if their income exceeds $1,500.Over the last five years, HDB has allocated rental flats to about 720 applicants who exceeded the income guideline of $1,500. There is no available data on the number of applicants who were rejected on the basis that they had incomes above $1,500, as applicants are not rejected solely based on their household income."
increase ridership of public transport,Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the latest mode share of public transport; (b) how have the shifts been in the last five years; and (c) how can the overall ridership of public transport be increased.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Based on LTA's Travel Survey, the peak-period Walk-Cycle-Ride (WCR) mode share is about 72% today. This is an increase from the mode share of 69% recorded in 2012. WCR includes walking, cycling, rides on public transport and point-to-point transport using taxis, private hire cars. Following our Land Transport Master Plan (LTMP) 2013 commitment to make public transport more accessible to all, we have expanded our rail network from 182 km to 229 km and built about 200 km of covered walkways. LTMP 2040 builds on this improvement and aims to achieve 90% peak-period WCR mode share by 2040. To meet this target, we will first, enhance our public transport network and improve bus speeds through more Transit Priority Corridors. Second, we will further expand rail connectivity. Third, we will expand the active mobility network and triple the cycling network, especially at the first-and-last mile level. Fourth, we will enhance safety for users through public education and effective enforcement against irresponsible users and retailers."
waiting period for eligible applicant to be assigned public rental flat,"Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for National Development (a) as of August 2019, what is the number of public rental flats that are not occupied; (b) what is the current number of accepted rental flat applicants on the wait list; and (c) what is the expected waiting period for an eligible applicant to be assigned a public rental flat.","Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB currently has available about 8,000 rental units. Not all of these are meant for new rental applications. We have earlier announced that HDB will be embarking on redevelopment plans for many of the older rental blocks. So, the buffer of rental units is also meant to cater to existing tenants whose flats will be due for redevelopment in the coming years.  Currently, there are about 200 households waiting to collect their keys to a public rental flat. Some of these households have already been invited for key collection, but chose to defer it, for instance due to locational preferences. Because we now have sufficient rental units to meet demand, the time taken for an applicant to be assigned a public rental flat is about two months, especially if the applicant is not particular about location. Some waiting time is inevitable for HDB to assess the application and to identify available rental units that will fit the applicant's preferred location.            "
practice to peg price of hdb bto flats to average income,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry will continue to keep the existing pricing of HDB BTO flats pegged against average income instead of market price in view of the recent raising of the income ceiling.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The Government is committed to providing affordable public housing to help citizen households own their first home. To do this, HDB prices its new flats at significant discounts to the market. In particular, we ensure that the vast majority of first-timer families are able to buy new BTO flats in non-mature estates and service their monthly mortgage instalments using their CPF, with zero or minimal cash outlay. So, even if the market price were to move up, we will continue to keep BTO prices affordable in line with this commitment."
regulating care-giver training programmes,Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked the Minister for Health (a) whether training programmes for caregivers are regulated to ensure participants are adequately trained to receive the necessary skills; (b) whether there are adequate professional training programmes to meet the needs of the elderly or those with special needs; and (c) whether subsidies and more support can be given for caregiving-related courses.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Government or Government-appointed entities manage a wide range of training courses to equip both community care staff and informal care-givers with the necessary skills to care for the elderly and persons with special needs. To ensure relevance and quality, such courses are selected or developed to meet care-givers' specific training needs and are conducted by qualified training personnel who have relevant experience. There is a range of subsidised training programmes that cater to healthcare professionals like nurses, allied health professionals and healthcare assistants. For example, community care staff can attend short courses under the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC)-appointed Learning Institutes or skills training courses under the Singapore Workforce Skills Qualifications for Healthcare Support. For formal qualifications leading to an advanced or specialised diploma, for example, in gerontology, they can apply for the Community Care Manpower Development Award administered by AIC, which covers up to 90% of the programme fees. Social service professionals in the disability sector can also enrol in a range of disability-related training programmes offered by the Social Service Institute. These programmes are generally short courses that help individuals develop specific competencies in supporting persons with special needs. Eligible employees working in National Council of Social Service member agencies can apply for the Voluntary Welfare Organisation-Charities Capability Fund to subsidise the training fees. Family care-givers and Foreign Domestic Workers can apply for the Caregivers Training Grant (CTG), which is a $200 annual subsidy for care-givers to attend training courses reviewed by AIC. These courses range from eldercare, caring for persons with disability, including autism and intellectual disabilities, to psychosocial support. Since 2013, over 40,000 care-givers have utilised the CTG.  We will continue to review the range and support for these training programmes that support community care staff and care-givers to care for the elderly and persons with special needs better. "
impact of decision to decline fda inspections of factories outside the us on generic medications in singapore,Mr Chong Kee Hiong asked the Minister for Health with regard to declining FDA inspections of factories outside of the US where much of the active ingredients for generic pharmaceuticals are manufactured (a) what is the impact on generic medications in Singapore; (b) how reliant is Singapore on FDA assessments and whether Singapore can have independent local inspections of medications; (c) what additional measures are in place to protect the quality of medications; and (d) how will the Ministry work with international health agencies to overcome this structural inspection problem.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) evaluates medicines, including generics, for safety, quality and efficacy before as well as after they are registered and allowed for supply in our local market. Before giving approval for registration, HSA inspects local medicines manufacturers to ensure that they comply with international Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standards. As for assessing manufacturers based overseas, HSA taps on its membership in the Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-operation Scheme. Membership to the scheme is granted only if a regulator has a strict inspection regime comparable with the high standards and quality of the other members. Some members in the scheme include regulators from Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, Switzerland and the US.If a member regulatory authority has inspected the overseas medicines manufacturers, HSA would leverage on their findings on the GMP assessment. Otherwise, HSA will conduct an overseas on-site inspection.  After a medicine is registered and sold in the Singapore market, inspections of manufacturers continue to be conducted on a regular basis. HSA also carries out post-market product quality sampling to test and ensure that the medicines comply with quality requirements and are safe for use by patients. In addition, HSA exchanges information and intelligence with other leading international regulatory authorities on the quality of the medicines, including generics."
services and diagnoses that can be made through telemedicine,"Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry will form a multi-disciplinary panel of experienced doctors to look into the types of services and diagnoses that can be made through telemedicine in Singapore, given the concerns over the risk of wrongful diagnosis.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Telemedicine can potentially make access to healthcare services more convenient for Singaporeans. It is an evolving field.In 2015, MOH's National Telemedicine Advisory Committee developed a set of telemedicine guidelines. These guidelines serve to guide healthcare providers in Singapore on the provision of safe and appropriate delivery of care via telemedicine. Overall, doctors providing telemedicine are expected to maintain the same standards of care as with in-person clinical consults. They should see their patients in-person when a physical assessment is warranted or refer them appropriately.Last year, MOH also set up a regulatory sandbox framework to facilitate the development of new and innovative telemedicine care models while ensuring patient safety and welfare. This arrangement enables telemedicine providers to work with the Ministry to better understand the challenges associated with the delivery of telemedicine.  With the experience garnered through the sandbox, the telemedicine guidelines are being refreshed. MOH, in consultation with various professional bodies, has appointed a review committee comprising of experienced family physicians and medical specialists from both public and private healthcare sectors, experts in medical informatics and medical ethics, as well as representatives from various governmental organisations.  The revised guidelines will be released in 2020. Together, the refreshed guidelines and regulatory sandbox will help inform MOH on how best to regulate telemedicine.  "
social service agencies' tracking of chin swee road toddler who died five years before,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Social and Family Development with regard to the death of a toddler in a Chin Swee Road flat (a) whether Government agencies and social service agencies could have picked up the death earlier; and (b) whether the rest of the siblings are in stable care arrangements.,"16 Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Social and Family Development why have Government agencies and the social services not been aware that the dead toddler recently found in a Chin Swee Road flat was missing for five years.17 Mr Chong Kee Hiong asked the Minister for Social and Family Development regarding the discovery of a child's body at Chin Swee Road, (a) whether the family was under the watch of any Ministry-appointed counsellor in view of the family situation, (b) if so, did the disappearance of the child raised any alert; and (c) if the Ministry has measures to verify the condition of children in such troubled families where parents are uncooperative, so as to detect potential abuse as early as possible.18 Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Social and Family Development with regard to the recent Chin Swee Road toddler death, whether the toddler's birth was registered and, if so, why Government agencies did not detect the child's absence from educational and other records in spite of the absence of a certificate of death. Mr Desmond Lee: I will give some background on our processes to protect victims of family violence. The National Family Violence Networking System (NFVNS) was set up by MSF to tighten partnerships amongst stakeholders such as the Singapore Police Force, hospitals and Family Service Centres to support individuals affected by family violence. We have strengthened the capabilities of professionals such as teachers, healthcare professionals and social workers to detect child abuse early and intervene appropriately. Sector-wide screening tools, such as the Sector-Specific Screening Guide (SSSG) and Child Abuse Reporting Guide (CARG), were developed to help professionals make timely decisions to escalate child abuse concerns to MSF Child Protective Service. Professionals are trained regularly on the use of these screening tools. The Penal Code was also amended in May this year to enhance protection for vulnerable victims. Maximum penalties for all offences in the Penal Code committed against vulnerable victims, including children below 14 years old, may be enhanced by up to twice the maximum penalties previously prescribed for the offence. Such offences committed against children below 14 years old were also made arrestable, regardless of whether the underlying offence was arrestable, to allow Police to intervene quickly. Let me now turn to the specific questions that Members have raised about the death of the two-year-old child. Mr Christopher de Souza asked about the other siblings in the affected family. The other children are all under alternative care arrangements. MSF will continue to provide the necessary support to ensure the children’s safety and welfare.Assoc Prof Daniel Goh, Mr Chong Kee Hiong and Mr Christopher de Souza asked if the death of the child could have been picked up earlier. Mr Dennis Tan also asked whether the child’s birth was registered and whether agencies could have detected the child's absence from educational and other records. ICA has confirmed that the child's birth was registered. Over the years, the family was known to, helped by or had contact with several various Government and community agencies, such as MSF Social Service Office, Child Protective Service, Home Team agencies, MOE, the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) and Family Service Centres. These were for various matters, such as for financial assistance, family well-being and childcare issues, education and pre-school matters, and so on. The family had previously approached the Social Service Office (SSO) to apply for financial assistance. The SSO had also linked the family up with a Family Service Centre for general support to improve the family and children’s well-being. The family also had previous interactions with Child Protective Service. During the social investigation, CPS will ascertain whether the children residing in the household are adequately provided for and work with the family to put in place a plan to address the concerns. ECDA engaged the family as part of the pre-school outreach programme. Under the programme, outreach agencies appointed by ECDA reach out to lower income families with children not enrolled in pre-school. The agency engages the care-giver or parents on the importance of pre-school education, helps facilitate enrolment of the child in a pre-school if requested and refers them to other help agencies if necessary. If the family is uncontactable or unresponsive despite numerous visit attempts, ECDA and the outreach agencies reach out to local community partners and work with them to try to engage the family when they are more receptive. As for education, MOE adopts several measures to reach out to parents whose children do not participate in the Primary 1 registration exercise. These include sending reminder letters and offering assistance to place the children in national Primary schools. Where there is no response to the reminder letters, MOE sends liaison officers to make home visits. If a child is not staying with the parents, MOE continues to work with various agencies to try to contact the care-givers of the child.  What members of the family said and did in their interactions with each of the different agencies and organisations over the years is relevant to on-going investigations and criminal proceedings. I should therefore not go into any specific detail. But what I will say is this: based on what the family members had said at that time and the interactions that the family had with the different agencies, the officers and social workers did not suspect that the child had gone missing or had come to any harm. The family had said that the child was being looked after by relatives. A two-year-old child will generally have no interaction, on a regular basis, with agencies. More details will be given in Court. "
haze management strategies for singapore healthcare institutes,Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked the Minister for Health how prepared are our health institutions to meet health issues that may arise from haze exposure.,"21 Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Health (a) what measures are in place in hospital wards and nursing homes especially non air-conditioned ones to help vulnerable Singaporeans cope with the haze situation; and (b) whether the Ministry has haze management guidelines for healthcare institutions in Singapore. 22 Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry has specific guidelines for public hospitals on protecting patients from the haze and whether all public hospital wards should be air-conditioned and fitted with air purification filters. Mr Gan Kim Yong: MOH has issued guidelines to public healthcare institutions to protect the welfare of its patients and staff during periods of haze. These guidelines apply to all public hospitals, polyclinics and nursing homes. In addition, MOH had provided funding to public hospitals, polyclinics and non-private nursing homes to purchase air purifiers and portable air coolers for use in naturally ventilated wards during haze situations. While MOH's current policy is for subsidised wards in public hospitals and for Government-built nursing homes to be naturally ventilated, these institutions can close the windows during sustained severe haze and deploy fans, portable air coolers and air purifiers to mitigate the effects of haze. Some of the newer hospitals such as Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, Jurong Community Hospital and Sengkang General and Community Hospitals are fitted with air filtration systems to supply filtered air to naturally ventilated wards during haze. MOH has also reminded residential and centre-based community care providers to replace outdoor activities with indoor ones when the haze situation worsens.Healthcare institutions will monitor patients closely for possible health effects from the haze, especially patients with higher care needs, including the elderly, pregnant women, children and those with existing chronic respiratory and heart disease. These patients will be given appropriate medical care when needed. To prepare for severe haze situations, MOH has also worked with the public hospitals and polyclinics to ensure adequate supply of masks and other medical supplies including medications. To cope with any surge in demand, the public hospitals have plans to ensure adequate staffing for critical services, such as Emergency Departments, and ramp up bed capacity as needed. At the polyclinics, fast track consultation and home medication delivery services are some of the measures deployed for vulnerable patients including those who need support at home. "
review of screening procedures for foreign domestic workers arriving in singapore,Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Home Affairs in light of the recent detentions of three foreign domestic workers under the Internal Security Act (a) whether there is a need to review existing regulations and procedures in screening foreign workers who are permitted to work in Singapore; and (b) whether the Ministry will be coordinating with MOM to enhance awareness of employers to identify radicalised behaviour in their workers.,"Mr K Shanmugam: We do have measures in place to screen foreign workers. However, the security screening can only pick up those with prior records. Individuals may also become radicalised after they have been in Singapore. We cannot just depend on screening. We have to stay vigilant, to identify and take actions against individuals who pose a threat to Singapore's security. Our security agencies also work closely with their foreign counterparts, exchange intelligence to help uncover threats.  The community also has a role to play. Family members, friends, colleagues and employers are best placed to notice possible signs of radicalisation and they should come forward if they suspect that someone they know might be involved in terrorism-related activities. Tell-tale signs include a change of behaviour and when the person starts to espouse extremist ideologies. MHA works closely with MOM in this area. MOM issues advisories to employers of foreign domestic workers to educate them on indicators to look out for in someone who may be radicalised or be involved in terrorism-related activities. MHA also worked with MOM to incorporate a counter-terrorism module in the Settling-In Programme for new foreign domestic workers. The module teaches new foreign domestic workers what they should and should not do, how they can look out for tell-tale signs of radicalised individuals, and the Police hotline to call.              "
plans for bilateral military co-operation with china,Mr Ong Teng Koon asked the Minister for Defence whether he can provide an update on plans for bilateral military co-operation with China.,"Dr Ng Eng Hen: Singapore's defence ties with China are healthy and growing. The SAF conducts regular exercises with the PLA. The flagship bilateral Army Exercise Cooperation was successfully completed in Singapore this year, progressing to company-plus level exercises. The Army looks forward to Exercise Cooperation 2020 in China. When the Exercise Cooperation was held in Nanjing in 2014, I witnessed the good rapport and professionalism on both sides there. Our Navy also successfully co-organised the inaugural ASEAN-China Maritime Exercise with the PLA Navy in October last year. I visited the exercise troops in Zhanjiang, and was happy to learn that they were using RSN's platform – the Information Fusion Centre's Real-Time Information Sharing System (IRIS) – to provide a common situation picture for the conduct of the exercise.Engagements between the military commanders and defence officials are frequent and productive. The Chief of Defence Force conducted his introductory visit to China in September 2018 and met his counterpart the PLA Chief of Joint Staff GEN Li Zuocheng. In November 2018, SAF's Chief of Air Force visited the Zhuhai Airshow and met Commander of the PLA Air Force GEN Ding Laihang. More recently in April 2019, the SAF's Chief of Navy attended the International Fleet Review in Qingdao in commemoration of the PLA Navy's 70th anniversary, hosted by Commander of the PLA Navy ADM Shen Jinlong. China Minister of National Defense and State Councilor GEN Wei Fenghe conducted his introductory visit and attended the 18th Shangri-La Dialogue earlier this year, the first time since 2011 that China was represented by their Defence Minister. I attend the Beijing Xiangshan Forum regularly and later this month, on their invitation, I will attend the 7th Military World Games Opening Ceremony and speak at the 9th Beijing Xiangshan Forum. Both China and Singapore have agreed in principle to step up defence cooperation and deepen defence ties further. To institutionalise and implement these efforts, both Ministries are actively working to conclude an enhanced Agreement on Defence Exchanges and Security Cooperation (ADESC), which was first signed in 2008. Among the items considered are formalising high-level dialogues and greater cooperation between the various Services, and academic and think-tank exchanges. We also want to increase the scale of existing bilateral exercises.Looking ahead, 2020 marks the 30th anniversary of Singapore-China diplomatic relations. Both defence establishments are exploring ways to commemorate the anniversary including through our flagship bilateral exercises – Exercise Maritime Cooperation and Exercise Cooperation – next year.These positive developments reflect the confidence and understanding of both countries towards each other, anchored on the shared goal of maintaining stability in our region through military cooperation. MINDEF and the SAF look forward to continue working with the Chinese defence establishment to build trust and cooperate in areas of mutual interest.                 "
ensuring media literacy council's materials are appropriate for schools,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) what are the Media Literary Council's guidelines regarding fake news, satire, parody and opinion; (b) how does the Council ensure that the media literacy curriculum and materials are age-appropriate for schools; and (c) what is the Ministry's overall media literacy plan for Singapore including that on matters under the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act.","39 Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) how many copies of the ""Get Smart with Sherlock"" booklet on fake news have been printed; (b) how many copies have been distributed to students; and (c) whether the Ministry will review the current vetting processes for such material. Mr S Iswaran: The Media Literacy Council aims to promote cyber safety and security, sound judgement and civility when online. Its overall public education effort falls under the themes ""Be Safe, Be Smart and Be Kind"". These efforts help to develop an informed and discerning public, which is the best defence against the threats posed by a fast-changing media landscape. The Council does not issue any guidelines.The Council members bring valuable expertise and perspectives from diverse fields and community groups. The Council also works with schools, businesses, community groups and Government agencies in developing educational programmes and materials on media literacy and cyber-wellness. The collective expertise of the Council's members and its consultative processes are key to ensuring that the Council's programmes and materials are of quality and relevance to its audience. For example, the ""Get Smart with Sherlock"" guide was developed as part of the Media Literacy Council's public education campaign. The Guide is a resource for the general adult public to understand the context and various forms of online content. The material was tested with demographically representative focus groups and refined to ensure its suitability. The guide was offered to schools as a resource for parents to use with their children. Twenty-nine schools requested copies of the guide and 32,000 copies were provided.The Council stopped the distribution of the guide in August. Advisories have been sent to the 29 schools to reiterate the intent for the guide to be used by parents. The Council regularly reviews its materials and processes in consultation with the Ministry and other stakeholders.The public education work undertaken by the Media Literacy Council is an important part of MCI's national effort to promote safe, secure and responsible online behaviour and consumption of media content. We will continue to support these efforts so that, together, we can help ensure responsible and discerning use of the internet and social media for the benefit of all citizens. "
efforts to further improve employment of senior singaporeans,Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what are the current employment trends and employment rates of Singaporeans between the ages of (i) 50 and 59 and (ii) 60 and 65 respectively; and (b) what are the policy measures and concerted efforts required to further improve the employment rate of senior Singaporeans.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: Over the past decade, concerted tripartite efforts have led to an improvement in older worker employment outcomes. The employment rate for residents aged 50 to 59 rose from 70% in 2008 to 76% in 2018. The employment rate for residents aged 60 to 64 saw a significant increase as well, from 47% in 2008 to 60% in 2018. A Tripartite Workgroup on Older Workers was formed to develop recommendations to help strengthen support for older worker employment. The Workgroup has released its recommendations in August this year. These recommendations were fully accepted by the Government. In particular, Prime Minister announced the Government's acceptance of the Workgroup's recommendation to raise the Retirement Age (RA) and Re-employment Age (REA) to 65 and 70 by 2030. The first move, to increase RA to 63 and REA to 68 will take effect from 1 July 2022. The increases in RA and REA will provide older workers the assurance of employment up to a higher age, while continuing to meet employers' need for flexibility to make reasonable adjustments to the employment terms of re-employed workers. As legislation alone is insufficient to achieve truly age-friendly labour markets, the Workgroup also made recommendations to promote inclusive and progressive workplaces for older workers. These include (a) voluntary adoption of the higher RA and REA ahead of scheduled legislative changes; (b) implementing transformative job redesign to effect systems-level and organisation-wide change; (c) engaging mature and older workers in structured career planning sessions to guide workers on the training they need for career development and re-employment; and (d) providing part time employment opportunities to allow more older workers to continue working at lower intensities. Both employers and older workers must play their parts in achieving productive longevity for Singaporeans. Employers must redesign workplaces and processes in ways that support older workers to continue contributing meaningfully and ensure they are equipped with the right skills to perform. Workers must also be adaptable, willing to upgrade and update their skills, and keep an open mind about trying new roles. The Government has committed to support both employers and workers to make these necessary changes. More details on this support will be shared at Budget 2020.          "
update on plans for action community for entrepreneurship,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether the Ministry can provide an update on the achievement of the Action Community for Entrepreneurship (ACE) programme and whether there is a need to evolve the current status of ACE.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: The Action Community for Entrepreneurship (ACE) was founded in 2003 to help start-ups in areas such as mentorship, network building, talent, and financing. It transitioned into a private sector-led organisation in 2014. In the last five years, ACE has supported more than 2,000 start-ups through various programmes and initiatives, including facilitating more than 200 mentorships through the ACE Mentorship Programme. As an Accredited Mentor Partner under Enterprise Singapore’s Startup SG Founder programme, ACE also mentors first-time entrepreneurs. Through its overseas networks, ACE has helped Singapore-based start-ups access international markets. ACE is constantly looking for new ways to invigorate our startup ecosystem. In August this year, it launched the Innovation Enablers Network (IEN) which aggregates opportunities for corporates and start-ups to collaborate on innovation. Through such connections, start-ups are able to gain access to new resources and build up their track record, while corporates benefit from knowing what are the cutting-edge innovative solutions.       "
subsidies for dyslexic students who take basic chinese programme at dyslexia association of singapore,"Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling asked the Minister for Education (a) whether subsidies can be provided for dyslexic students who wish to take the basic Chinese programme offered by the Dyslexia Association of Singapore; and (b) if not possible, what are the reasons for the non-provision.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: MOE is the major supporter of the work of the Dyslexia Association of Singapore (DAS). Our focus is the evidence-based Main Literacy Programme for dyslexia, but we do not provide funding for the other programmes offered by DAS, such as Chinese, Mathematics, Speech and Drama.  Research into dyslexia for different languages, especially Mother Tongue Languages (MTL), and the specific learning support is a developing field. MOE monitors various research findings in MTL learning difficulties and is open to adopting evidence-based and effective targeted interventions for students with dyslexia.In the meantime, MOE provides additional support for students with difficulties in learning MTL in schools, on a needs basis. Our Primary school curriculum ensures that MTL learning in Primary 1 and 2 focuses on listening and speaking. We will be implementing the Mother Tongue Support Programme for Primary 3 and 4 students in 2021 and 2022 respectively. After Primary 4, students who have persistent difficulties in coping with the standard MTL curriculum can consider offering Foundation MTL in Primary 5 and 6, and subsequently MTL ""B"" in Secondary school and Junior College.        "
complaints made to do not call registry,"Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) in the past three years, what is the number of complaint cases reported to the Do Not Call (DNC) registry; (b) how many of these complaint cases are repeated cases involving the same complainant's phone number; and (c) what actions have been taken against the perpetrators.","Mr S Iswaran: Since 2017, the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) has received 46,600 complaints on unsolicited calls and text messages. Around 90% of these complaints relate to serious crimes such as unlicensed moneylending and illegal gambling, and are referred to the Singapore Police Force. Of the remainder, about 400 complaints are repeat cases involving the same complainants. The PDPC has taken action against more than 1,000 organisations since 2017. These actions range from issuing advisory notices and warnings, to prosecution. In determining the appropriate enforcement action, the PDPC takes into account factors such as the harm caused, the number of complaints against the organisation and recidivism. The PDPC keeps a close watch on organisations' compliance with the Do Not Call obligations and will not hesitate to take appropriate enforcement action against errant organisations.                      "
percentage in each cohort of teachers who have been offered re-employment,"Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Education (a) since 2016, what is the number as well as percentage of each cohort of teachers who have been offered re-employment upon reaching 62 years old; (b) whether there has been an increase in the number of teachers not being offered re-employment since the recent merger of schools; (c) what are the reasons for teachers who have reached the retirement age not being offered re-employment; and (d) whether there are excess teachers in the school system now.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: MOE's re-employment practices are aligned to those of the Singapore Public Service. From 2014 to 2018, about 90% of retiring teachers are offered re-employment every year. Whether a teacher is offered re-employment at age 62 is primarily determined by the teacher’s performance and conduct. It has nothing to do with school mergers.Our overall teacher workforce numbers have remained stable in the last five years. Against a backdrop of falling birth rates and smaller student cohort sizes, the pupil to teacher ratio has improved over the years and teachers have been deployed to do meaningful work."
plans to reduce students' reliance on private tuition,"Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for Education in view of the massive amount spent on private tuition, whether there have been any studies on why students rely on tuition and whether the Ministry has any plans to reduce students' reliance on tuition.","32 Mr Seah Kian Peng asked the Minister for Education in view of the $1.4 billion spent on private tuition by Singapore households in 2018 (a) whether the Ministry has concerns about this phenomenon; and (b) whether the Ministry allows current MOE teachers to give private tuition and, if so, what proportion of these teachers give private tuition now. Mr Ong Ye Kung: The reasons for taking up tuition are multi-faceted. It is important to be able to distinguish when it is desirable and when it is not. For example, we recognise that tuition can benefit students who are genuinely in need of more dedicated help in coping with their studies. This is why some of our schools have partnerships with volunteers and Self-Help Groups that provide affordable academic support. We also know that, at heart, many parents send their children for tuition out of care and concern for their child. They worry whether their children can cope with their studies and about examinations.  However, if a child is generally coping well academically and understands the fundamentals, tuition may not be necessary and can even be detrimental. Excessive reliance on tuition can diminish the ability for independent learning, deprive students of opportunities to develop self-management skills and promote unhealthy competition. Further, widespread and continuous tuition can lead to a pervasive tuition culture anchored on excessive focus on academic grades, and a mind-set that academic grades is only one way to succeed in life. This runs counter to our philosophy of holistic education and our goal of nurturing lifelong learners. In response to Mr Lim Biow Chuan's question on reducing reliance on tuition, we first have to address the excessive focus on academic grades, with the emphasis here being on ""excessive"". In order to strike the right balance MOE has, in recent years, introduced several policy changes under our Learn for Life movement. For example, we have expanded the number of Direct School Admission (DSA) places in schools, reduced school-based assessments, and will be implementing changes to the PSLE scoring system in 2021. By 2024, we will roll out Full Subject-Based Banding in all Secondary schools. Our curriculum has also evolved to become more inquiry-based, more experiential.  We continue to support students who need additional help in schools, through initiatives such as learning support programmes for English and Mathematics. Our schools will continue to provide more resources for students who have learning needs, including having smaller class sizes for these students. Schools will also maintain their partnerships with Self-Help Groups to provide support for our students.Mr Seah Kian Peng has asked what proportion of our teachers are currently giving tuition. Our surveys indicate that it is not a prevalent practice – around one in 10 teachers is giving paid tuition. Nevertheless, this is a matter that MOE continues to monitor closely, as we would be concerned if our teachers are distracted from their core responsibility to support their students in our schools, especially those who are in need of more support from our teachers.  The public sector has existing guidelines on public servants participating in outside activities that may place them in possible conflict of interest situations, or where we would deem it necessary for approvals to be given to ensure proper conduct and avoid distraction of individual officers from their core duties. MOE will periodically review our guidelines and regulations for our teachers giving paid private tuition to ensure that they remain focused on their core duties.    Reducing an over-reliance on tuition is not something that MOE can do alone. It requires the support of parents and the wider community. It also requires a mindset change that shifts away from an excessive focus on academic grades to one of holistic education, and an understanding that there are many different pathways for our children to achieve their full potential and do well in life. To that end, we recently introduced guidelines for School-Home partnerships, to share ways in which parents and schools can work together to help enable children develop self-management skills and take ownership of their learning. Together with parents, we can shift the culture to one where our children have the self-confidence and support from their families, schools and peers to manage their learning, instead of turning to tuition as the default option whenever they feel they need help.                         "
impact of increase in public transport fares on amount of vouchers given out and on financial sustainability of public transport operators,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Transport in light of the Public Transport Council's announcement of a fare increase of up to 7% in the 2019 fare review exercise (a) whether the Ministry intends to increase the quantum to be disbursed in the 2019 public transport voucher exercise; and (b) how does LTA ensure the financial sustainability of our public transport without degrading service standards when fare adjustments are not in tandem with the cost of operation.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The Public Transport Council (PTC)'s fare formula was designed to keep fares in line with macroeconomic cost factors, such as inflation, wages, fuel, and network capacity increases, together with a productivity extraction. However, as I had explained in July this year, the fare adjustments were not fully implemented for many years, contributing to substantial losses by the public transport operators, and resulting in increased Government subsidies. We cannot keep adding to taxpayers' burden, since every dollar spent on public transport subsidies is a dollar less for other national priorities like education and healthcare. The operators cannot sustain losses without performance degradation. As responsible employers, they also need to ensure that their workers' livelihoods are not affected. For all these reasons, we must keep our costs in check and set fares at the right level. The PTC will ensure fares remain affordable for all. Our public transport fares are among the most affordable in the world, especially for concession groups such as students and seniors. One in two Singaporeans enjoys concessionary fares with a discount as high as 70% of adult fares.In addition, the Government will step in to cushion the impact of the fare adjustment on lower income households. For example, for the 2018 Fare Review Exercise, the Government made available 300,000 Public Transport Vouchers (PTVs) worth $30 each. This is the largest PTV Exercise to date.               "
selection criteria applied to smes for scale-up sg initiative,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what are the key criteria for SMEs to be selected for the Scale-up SG initiative; and (b) what is the likely number of companies that will benefit from this programme over the next 24 months.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: Scale-up SG supports local companies with high growth potential to develop into global or regional leaders in their respective sectors. Participating companies go through a 2.5-year programme together with Enterprise Singapore and other programme partners. We support the companies in management development, business innovation, market penetration and other areas that will help to accelerate their growth.As the process is resource-intensive, we choose the participating companies carefully. Besides a high level of commitment from the founders and CEOs to embark on an ambitious growth plan, ESG also looks at the company's track record; the commitment to grow its presence in Singapore, especially headquarters and management control functions; and the potential to create economic spin-offs for Singapore and create good jobs for Singaporeans. Scale-up SG was launched in July 2019 with 25 companies from various industries in the first two cohorts. Examples of companies include JUMBO Group from the food and beverage sector, AEM Holdings from the advanced manufacturing sector, Chye Thiam Maintenance from the cleaning and waste management sector, and Health Management International from the healthcare sector. Enterprise Singapore plans for another four to six cohorts to embark on the Scale-up SG programme over the next two years, with each cohort comprising 10 to 15 companies."
non-legally trained persons providing advice for drafting of wills,"Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling asked the Minister for Law (a) whether the Ministry has statistics regarding organisations or non-legally trained individuals who are advising clients on the drafting of wills; and (b) whether the Ministry intends to restrict, supervise or regulate non-lawyers and organisations that are not legally trained from dealing with the business of will drafting.","Mr K Shanmugam: Will-writing services are not restricted solely to lawyers and are not a regulated activity under the Legal Profession Act1. This accords with the approach in other jurisdictions such as Britain. People who wish to make a will have a range of choices. They may write the will themselves, or seek the help of a will-writing service provider. Those who envisage their assets being distributed or managed in a complex manner can engage a lawyer to assist with drafting the will. The Legal Aid Bureau also offers legal assistance in the drafting of wills to Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents of limited means. We do not maintain statistics on the provision of will-writing services.We encourage the public to deposit information on their wills with the Wills Registry, which is a confidential registry maintained by the Public Trustee. Doing so will make it easier to locate the will in future.  "
hdb rental flat applicants who have exceeded income eligibility ceiling,"Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for National Development over the past five years, how many successful HDB rental flat applicants have exceeded the income eligibility threshold of $1,500.","29 Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for National Development how many applications to rent HDB flats under the Public Rental Scheme have been rejected because the applicants have exceeded the household income ceiling in the three years before the change in policy to make the criteria more flexible.Mr Lawrence Wong: For some time now, HDB has been taking a needs-based approach in assessing requests for public rental flats. HDB will evaluate each application holistically, taking into account factors such as household income, and whether the applicants have other housing options and family support.  This approach is not new. MND has stated this in Parliament previously and highlighted that HDB will assist those in need with a public rental flat even if their income exceeds $1,500.Over the last five years, HDB has allocated rental flats to about 720 applicants who exceeded the income guideline of $1,500. There is no available data on the number of applicants who were rejected on the basis that they had incomes above $1,500, as applicants are not rejected solely based on their household income."
increase ridership of public transport,Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the latest mode share of public transport; (b) how have the shifts been in the last five years; and (c) how can the overall ridership of public transport be increased.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Based on LTA's Travel Survey, the peak-period Walk-Cycle-Ride (WCR) mode share is about 72% today. This is an increase from the mode share of 69% recorded in 2012. WCR includes walking, cycling, rides on public transport and point-to-point transport using taxis, private hire cars. Following our Land Transport Master Plan (LTMP) 2013 commitment to make public transport more accessible to all, we have expanded our rail network from 182 km to 229 km and built about 200 km of covered walkways. LTMP 2040 builds on this improvement and aims to achieve 90% peak-period WCR mode share by 2040. To meet this target, we will first, enhance our public transport network and improve bus speeds through more Transit Priority Corridors. Second, we will further expand rail connectivity. Third, we will expand the active mobility network and triple the cycling network, especially at the first-and-last mile level. Fourth, we will enhance safety for users through public education and effective enforcement against irresponsible users and retailers."
waiting period for eligible applicant to be assigned public rental flat,"Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for National Development (a) as of August 2019, what is the number of public rental flats that are not occupied; (b) what is the current number of accepted rental flat applicants on the wait list; and (c) what is the expected waiting period for an eligible applicant to be assigned a public rental flat.","Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB currently has available about 8,000 rental units. Not all of these are meant for new rental applications. We have earlier announced that HDB will be embarking on redevelopment plans for many of the older rental blocks. So, the buffer of rental units is also meant to cater to existing tenants whose flats will be due for redevelopment in the coming years.  Currently, there are about 200 households waiting to collect their keys to a public rental flat. Some of these households have already been invited for key collection, but chose to defer it, for instance due to locational preferences. Because we now have sufficient rental units to meet demand, the time taken for an applicant to be assigned a public rental flat is about two months, especially if the applicant is not particular about location. Some waiting time is inevitable for HDB to assess the application and to identify available rental units that will fit the applicant's preferred location.            "
practice to peg price of hdb bto flats to average income,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry will continue to keep the existing pricing of HDB BTO flats pegged against average income instead of market price in view of the recent raising of the income ceiling.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The Government is committed to providing affordable public housing to help citizen households own their first home. To do this, HDB prices its new flats at significant discounts to the market. In particular, we ensure that the vast majority of first-timer families are able to buy new BTO flats in non-mature estates and service their monthly mortgage instalments using their CPF, with zero or minimal cash outlay. So, even if the market price were to move up, we will continue to keep BTO prices affordable in line with this commitment."

The Chief of Defence Force conducted his introductory visit to China in September 2018 and met his counterpart the PLA Chief of Joint Staff GEN Li Zuocheng. In November 2018, SAF's Chief of Air Force visited the Zhuhai Airshow and met Commander of the PLA Air Force GEN Ding Laihang. More recently in April 2019, the SAF's Chief of Navy attended the International Fleet Review in Qingdao in commemoration of the PLA Navy's 70th anniversary, hosted by Commander of the PLA Navy ADM Shen Jinlong. China Minister of National Defense and State Councilor GEN Wei Fenghe conducted his introductory visit and attended the 18th Shangri-La Dialogue earlier this year, the first time since 2011 that China was represented by their Defence Minister. I attend the Beijing Xiangshan Forum regularly and later this month, on their invitation, I will attend the 7th Military World Games Opening Ceremony and speak at the 9th Beijing Xiangshan Forum. Both China and Singapore have agreed in principle to step up defence cooperation and deepen defence ties further. To institutionalise and implement these efforts, both Ministries are actively working to conclude an enhanced Agreement on Defence Exchanges and Security Cooperation (ADESC), which was first signed in 2008. Among the items considered are formalising high-level dialogues and greater cooperation between the various Services, and academic and think-tank exchanges. We also want to increase the scale of existing bilateral exercises.Looking ahead, 2020 marks the 30th anniversary of Singapore-China diplomatic relations. Both defence establishments are exploring ways to commemorate the anniversary including through our flagship bilateral exercises – Exercise Maritime Cooperation and Exercise Cooperation – next year.These positive developments reflect the confidence and understanding of both countries towards each other, anchored on the shared goal of maintaining stability in our region through military cooperation. MINDEF and the SAF look forward to continue working with the Chinese defence establishment to build trust and cooperate in areas of mutual interest.                 "
ensuring media literacy council's materials are appropriate for schools,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) what are the Media Literary Council's guidelines regarding fake news, satire, parody and opinion; (b) how does the Council ensure that the media literacy curriculum and materials are age-appropriate for schools; and (c) what is the Ministry's overall media literacy plan for Singapore including that on matters under the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act.","39 Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) how many copies of the ""Get Smart with Sherlock"" booklet on fake news have been printed; (b) how many copies have been distributed to students; and (c) whether the Ministry will review the current vetting processes for such material. Mr S Iswaran: The Media Literacy Council aims to promote cyber safety and security, sound judgement and civility when online. Its overall public education effort falls under the themes ""Be Safe, Be Smart and Be Kind"". These efforts help to develop an informed and discerning public, which is the best defence against the threats posed by a fast-changing media landscape. The Council does not issue any guidelines.The Council members bring valuable expertise and perspectives from diverse fields and community groups. The Council also works with schools, businesses, community groups and Government agencies in developing educational programmes and materials on media literacy and cyber-wellness. The collective expertise of the Council's members and its consultative processes are key to ensuring that the Council's programmes and materials are of quality and relevance to its audience. For example, the ""Get Smart with Sherlock"" guide was developed as part of the Media Literacy Council's public education campaign. The Guide is a resource for the general adult public to understand the context and various forms of online content. The material was tested with demographically representative focus groups and refined to ensure its suitability. The guide was offered to schools as a resource for parents to use with their children. Twenty-nine schools requested copies of the guide and 32,000 copies were provided.The Council stopped the distribution of the guide in August. Advisories have been sent to the 29 schools to reiterate the intent for the guide to be used by parents. The Council regularly reviews its materials and processes in consultation with the Ministry and other stakeholders.The public education work undertaken by the Media Literacy Council is an important part of MCI's national effort to promote safe, secure and responsible online behaviour and consumption of media content. We will continue to support these efforts so that, together, we can help ensure responsible and discerning use of the internet and social media for the benefit of all citizens. "
efforts to further improve employment of senior singaporeans,Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what are the current employment trends and employment rates of Singaporeans between the ages of (i) 50 and 59 and (ii) 60 and 65 respectively; and (b) what are the policy measures and concerted efforts required to further improve the employment rate of senior Singaporeans.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: Over the past decade, concerted tripartite efforts have led to an improvement in older worker employment outcomes. The employment rate for residents aged 50 to 59 rose from 70% in 2008 to 76% in 2018. The employment rate for residents aged 60 to 64 saw a significant increase as well, from 47% in 2008 to 60% in 2018. A Tripartite Workgroup on Older Workers was formed to develop recommendations to help strengthen support for older worker employment. The Workgroup has released its recommendations in August this year. These recommendations were fully accepted by the Government. In particular, Prime Minister announced the Government's acceptance of the Workgroup's recommendation to raise the Retirement Age (RA) and Re-employment Age (REA) to 65 and 70 by 2030. The first move, to increase RA to 63 and REA to 68 will take effect from 1 July 2022. The increases in RA and REA will provide older workers the assurance of employment up to a higher age, while continuing to meet employers' need for flexibility to make reasonable adjustments to the employment terms of re-employed workers. As legislation alone is insufficient to achieve truly age-friendly labour markets, the Workgroup also made recommendations to promote inclusive and progressive workplaces for older workers. These include (a) voluntary adoption of the higher RA and REA ahead of scheduled legislative changes; (b) implementing transformative job redesign to effect systems-level and organisation-wide change; (c) engaging mature and older workers in structured career planning sessions to guide workers on the training they need for career development and re-employment; and (d) providing part time employment opportunities to allow more older workers to continue working at lower intensities. Both employers and older workers must play their parts in achieving productive longevity for Singaporeans. Employers must redesign workplaces and processes in ways that support older workers to continue contributing meaningfully and ensure they are equipped with the right skills to perform. Workers must also be adaptable, willing to upgrade and update their skills, and keep an open mind about trying new roles. The Government has committed to support both employers and workers to make these necessary changes. More details on this support will be shared at Budget 2020.          "
update on plans for action community for entrepreneurship,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether the Ministry can provide an update on the achievement of the Action Community for Entrepreneurship (ACE) programme and whether there is a need to evolve the current status of ACE.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: The Action Community for Entrepreneurship (ACE) was founded in 2003 to help start-ups in areas such as mentorship, network building, talent, and financing. It transitioned into a private sector-led organisation in 2014. In the last five years, ACE has supported more than 2,000 start-ups through various programmes and initiatives, including facilitating more than 200 mentorships through the ACE Mentorship Programme. As an Accredited Mentor Partner under Enterprise Singapore’s Startup SG Founder programme, ACE also mentors first-time entrepreneurs. Through its overseas networks, ACE has helped Singapore-based start-ups access international markets. ACE is constantly looking for new ways to invigorate our startup ecosystem. In August this year, it launched the Innovation Enablers Network (IEN) which aggregates opportunities for corporates and start-ups to collaborate on innovation. Through such connections, start-ups are able to gain access to new resources and build up their track record, while corporates benefit from knowing what are the cutting-edge innovative solutions.       "
subsidies for dyslexic students who take basic chinese programme at dyslexia association of singapore,"Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling asked the Minister for Education (a) whether subsidies can be provided for dyslexic students who wish to take the basic Chinese programme offered by the Dyslexia Association of Singapore; and (b) if not possible, what are the reasons for the non-provision.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: MOE is the major supporter of the work of the Dyslexia Association of Singapore (DAS). Our focus is the evidence-based Main Literacy Programme for dyslexia, but we do not provide funding for the other programmes offered by DAS, such as Chinese, Mathematics, Speech and Drama.  Research into dyslexia for different languages, especially Mother Tongue Languages (MTL), and the specific learning support is a developing field. MOE monitors various research findings in MTL learning difficulties and is open to adopting evidence-based and effective targeted interventions for students with dyslexia.In the meantime, MOE provides additional support for students with difficulties in learning MTL in schools, on a needs basis. Our Primary school curriculum ensures that MTL learning in Primary 1 and 2 focuses on listening and speaking. We will be implementing the Mother Tongue Support Programme for Primary 3 and 4 students in 2021 and 2022 respectively. After Primary 4, students who have persistent difficulties in coping with the standard MTL curriculum can consider offering Foundation MTL in Primary 5 and 6, and subsequently MTL ""B"" in Secondary school and Junior College.        "
complaints made to do not call registry,"Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) in the past three years, what is the number of complaint cases reported to the Do Not Call (DNC) registry; (b) how many of these complaint cases are repeated cases involving the same complainant's phone number; and (c) what actions have been taken against the perpetrators.","Mr S Iswaran: Since 2017, the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) has received 46,600 complaints on unsolicited calls and text messages. Around 90% of these complaints relate to serious crimes such as unlicensed moneylending and illegal gambling, and are referred to the Singapore Police Force. Of the remainder, about 400 complaints are repeat cases involving the same complainants. The PDPC has taken action against more than 1,000 organisations since 2017. These actions range from issuing advisory notices and warnings, to prosecution. In determining the appropriate enforcement action, the PDPC takes into account factors such as the harm caused, the number of complaints against the organisation and recidivism. The PDPC keeps a close watch on organisations' compliance with the Do Not Call obligations and will not hesitate to take appropriate enforcement action against errant organisations.                      "
percentage in each cohort of teachers who have been offered re-employment,"Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Education (a) since 2016, what is the number as well as percentage of each cohort of teachers who have been offered re-employment upon reaching 62 years old; (b) whether there has been an increase in the number of teachers not being offered re-employment since the recent merger of schools; (c) what are the reasons for teachers who have reached the retirement age not being offered re-employment; and (d) whether there are excess teachers in the school system now.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: MOE's re-employment practices are aligned to those of the Singapore Public Service. From 2014 to 2018, about 90% of retiring teachers are offered re-employment every year. Whether a teacher is offered re-employment at age 62 is primarily determined by the teacher’s performance and conduct. It has nothing to do with school mergers.Our overall teacher workforce numbers have remained stable in the last five years. Against a backdrop of falling birth rates and smaller student cohort sizes, the pupil to teacher ratio has improved over the years and teachers have been deployed to do meaningful work."
one-room flexi flats for singles with lower financial capability,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development whether HDB will consider building 1-room Flexi flats that are integrated with other flat types for singles who have a lower financial capability to purchase HDB flats.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Eligible singles can purchase 2-room Flexi BTO flats in the non-mature estates. Such flats come in two sizes, 36 sqm and 45 sqm, and are integrated with other flat types in the same blocks. The smaller 36-sqm flat is cheaper and caters to singles who have more limited budgets or less space needs. In fact, after the generous Government discounts and subsidies, first-timer singles buying new flats, on average, use only about 20% of their monthly income for mortgage instalments. This means that they are generally able to service their mortgages from their CPF contributions, with little or no cash outlay. So, the existing 2-room Flexi units provide affordable housing options for singles and there may not be a need to make the flat sizes smaller."
security bollards to prevent vehicles from ploughing into bus stops,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry will consider constructing bollards in front of all bus stops to prevent vehicles ploughing into the bus stops and injuring people but yet allowing wheelchair users to pass through these bollards to board their buses.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: LTA builds safety bollards at all bus stops, unless the site conditions do not allow for their construction. So far, bollards have been built at 98% of all bus stops. They are designed to allow wheelchair passengers to board and alight at the bus stops."
regulating care-giver training programmes,Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked the Minister for Health (a) whether training programmes for caregivers are regulated to ensure participants are adequately trained to receive the necessary skills; (b) whether there are adequate professional training programmes to meet the needs of the elderly or those with special needs; and (c) whether subsidies and more support can be given for caregiving-related courses.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Government or Government-appointed entities manage a wide range of training courses to equip both community care staff and informal care-givers with the necessary skills to care for the elderly and persons with special needs. To ensure relevance and quality, such courses are selected or developed to meet care-givers' specific training needs and are conducted by qualified training personnel who have relevant experience. There is a range of subsidised training programmes that cater to healthcare professionals like nurses, allied health professionals and healthcare assistants. For example, community care staff can attend short courses under the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC)-appointed Learning Institutes or skills training courses under the Singapore Workforce Skills Qualifications for Healthcare Support. For formal qualifications leading to an advanced or specialised diploma, for example, in gerontology, they can apply for the Community Care Manpower Development Award administered by AIC, which covers up to 90% of the programme fees. Social service professionals in the disability sector can also enrol in a range of disability-related training programmes offered by the Social Service Institute. These programmes are generally short courses that help individuals develop specific competencies in supporting persons with special needs. Eligible employees working in National Council of Social Service member agencies can apply for the Voluntary Welfare Organisation-Charities Capability Fund to subsidise the training fees. Family care-givers and Foreign Domestic Workers can apply for the Caregivers Training Grant (CTG), which is a $200 annual subsidy for care-givers to attend training courses reviewed by AIC. These courses range from eldercare, caring for persons with disability, including autism and intellectual disabilities, to psychosocial support. Since 2013, over 40,000 care-givers have utilised the CTG.  We will continue to review the range and support for these training programmes that support community care staff and care-givers to care for the elderly and persons with special needs better. "
impact of decision to decline fda inspections of factories outside the us on generic medications in singapore,Mr Chong Kee Hiong asked the Minister for Health with regard to declining FDA inspections of factories outside of the US where much of the active ingredients for generic pharmaceuticals are manufactured (a) what is the impact on generic medications in Singapore; (b) how reliant is Singapore on FDA assessments and whether Singapore can have independent local inspections of medications; (c) what additional measures are in place to protect the quality of medications; and (d) how will the Ministry work with international health agencies to overcome this structural inspection problem.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) evaluates medicines, including generics, for safety, quality and efficacy before as well as after they are registered and allowed for supply in our local market. Before giving approval for registration, HSA inspects local medicines manufacturers to ensure that they comply with international Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standards. As for assessing manufacturers based overseas, HSA taps on its membership in the Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-operation Scheme. Membership to the scheme is granted only if a regulator has a strict inspection regime comparable with the high standards and quality of the other members. Some members in the scheme include regulators from Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, Switzerland and the US.If a member regulatory authority has inspected the overseas medicines manufacturers, HSA would leverage on their findings on the GMP assessment. Otherwise, HSA will conduct an overseas on-site inspection.  After a medicine is registered and sold in the Singapore market, inspections of manufacturers continue to be conducted on a regular basis. HSA also carries out post-market product quality sampling to test and ensure that the medicines comply with quality requirements and are safe for use by patients. In addition, HSA exchanges information and intelligence with other leading international regulatory authorities on the quality of the medicines, including generics."
services and diagnoses that can be made through telemedicine,"Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry will form a multi-disciplinary panel of experienced doctors to look into the types of services and diagnoses that can be made through telemedicine in Singapore, given the concerns over the risk of wrongful diagnosis.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Telemedicine can potentially make access to healthcare services more convenient for Singaporeans. It is an evolving field.In 2015, MOH's National Telemedicine Advisory Committee developed a set of telemedicine guidelines. These guidelines serve to guide healthcare providers in Singapore on the provision of safe and appropriate delivery of care via telemedicine. Overall, doctors providing telemedicine are expected to maintain the same standards of care as with in-person clinical consults. They should see their patients in-person when a physical assessment is warranted or refer them appropriately.Last year, MOH also set up a regulatory sandbox framework to facilitate the development of new and innovative telemedicine care models while ensuring patient safety and welfare. This arrangement enables telemedicine providers to work with the Ministry to better understand the challenges associated with the delivery of telemedicine.  With the experience garnered through the sandbox, the telemedicine guidelines are being refreshed. MOH, in consultation with various professional bodies, has appointed a review committee comprising of experienced family physicians and medical specialists from both public and private healthcare sectors, experts in medical informatics and medical ethics, as well as representatives from various governmental organisations.  The revised guidelines will be released in 2020. Together, the refreshed guidelines and regulatory sandbox will help inform MOH on how best to regulate telemedicine.  "
transnational families living under public rental scheme,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what is the current percentage of transnational families that are living under the Public Rental Scheme; (b) how many of these families also require services from other Ministries such as learning support or medical subsidies; (c) whether the Ministry has considered a family-centred approach with one key social worker who assists and facilitates the transnational families in accessing the services they need; and (d) whether there are plans to invest more resources for transnational families to include job skills and language-based training, and providing language interpreters in schools to better help the integration of the foreign parent.","Mr Desmond Lee: About 7%, or around 3,300, of the families living in Public Rental flats are transnational families, defined as households headed by Singaporeans married to foreigners. The Government takes a family-centric approach and works closely with community partners to deliver comprehensive, convenient and coordinated support to families in need. Social Service Offices (SSO) and the Family Service Centres (FSC) are two key touchpoints for low-income and vulnerable households. SSO officers and FSC social workers seek to work closely with families, including transnational families, to address their needs and challenges. These could include health, housing, schooling and employment concerns, or other family-related issues. To support families facing complex circumstances, a lead agency is identified to have oversight of the family’s needs. The lead agency works closely with the family, and also rallies other agencies and partners to coordinate and align their interventions. This way, we can render holistic help to support the family towards stabilising and improving their circumstances. We recognise that transnational families may face unique challenges, such as language difficulties. To address this, foreign spouses who attend our marriage preparation programmes can also sign up for free basic language classes, to help reduce language barriers in daily life. Alternatively, they can also attend language courses run by the People's Association. Schools have not reported difficulties interacting with foreign parents, but where language is a barrier, they can enlist the help of the other parent, family members or school personnel who are conversant in the foreign parent’s preferred language."
legal tools to prevent taking of videos or footage of security officials attending to crisis,"Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Home Affairs what legal tools are present to deter the taking of video or camera footage of police officers, or officers from security agencies, who are attending to a crisis or security threat, especially where taking of such footage interferes with the officers' ability to de-escalate the threat and secure public safety.","Mr K Shanmugam: Taking videos or pictures of law enforcement officers conducting security operations can interfere with and jeopardise the operations, endangering the safety of the public and our officers.Under ordinary circumstances, the Public Order Act (POA) empowers law enforcement officers to direct a specific person to stop taking or sharing films or pictures of ongoing operations. Failing to comply is an offence which carries a punishment of up to one year imprisonment, a fine of up to $20,000, or both.  For serious incidents that could cause mass public disorder, such as terrorist attacks, the Public Order and Safety (Special Powers) Act (POSSPA) provides Police with special powers to exert further control over communications. Under POSSPA, the Commissioner of Police can issue a Communications Stop Order (CSO). It bans the taking or sharing of films, pictures, texts, or audio messages of the entire declared incident area. Unlike the powers provided for in the POA, this order does not need to be directed towards any specific individual, but bans all persons. Offenders that breach the CSO are liable to two years' imprisonment, a fine of up to $20,000, or both.These special powers are not available in day-to-day operations and need to be activated by the Minister for Home Affairs before they can be used."
foreign workers with injuries or occupational diseases sustained at work who filed claim under work injury compensation act,"Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Manpower (a) since 2017, what is the number of foreign workers with injuries or occupational diseases sustained at work who have filed a claim under the Work Injury Compensation Act; (b) what is the breakdown of the nationalities of these claimants; (c) how many have been successful in their claims; and (d) what are the actions taken to discourage false claims.","Mrs Josephine Teo: In 2017 and 2018, there were about 18,200 claims from foreign workers for work-related injury or disease under the Work Injury Compensation Act (WICA). These claimants comprise less than 1% of our foreign workforce. This has stayed around the same level in the last three years. Claimants can be of any nationality but given the occupations they tend to be in, there are more from Bangladesh, China, India and Malaysia.Among the approximately 17,500 cases that have since concluded, 85% were valid claims, 13% were withdrawn, and the remaining 2% were invalid claims as their injuries were not deemed as work-related. The vast majority of the invalid claims made in the past two years were due to misunderstanding over what scenarios are claimable under the WICA. We have found five cases in the past two years with dishonest intent to claim compensation. We have initiated prosecution against all of them. Those convicted will face a maximum fine of $15,000 and/or 12 months' imprisonment under the WICA and will be permanently barred from working in Singapore."
additional housing grants and priority for adults with special needs to live near care-givers,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry will consider providing special additional housing grants and special priority for adults with special needs to live near their parents or caregivers when they apply for their first HDB flat.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The Government already provides significant subsidies to help Singaporeans purchase their first HDB flats. These include pricing new HDB flats at a generous discount to market, and offering additional grants to first-timers. They also enjoy priority when they apply for new flats close to their parents. Beyond BTO flats, first-timers can also opt for resale flats near their parents, where there are many more options to consider. They will then enjoy the relevant CPF housing grants, as well as the Proximity Housing Grant, which was recently enhanced in 2018. First-timer applicants with special needs will benefit from all of these measures. We will continue to review and update our housing schemes to ensure affordable and accessible housing for all Singaporeans, including those with special needs. "
appeals for lease buyback scheme from persons who have not yet fully paid up housing loan,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development (a) since the introduction of the Lease Buyback Scheme, how many appeals have been received from HDB flat owners who wish to apply for the scheme but have yet to fully pay up for the housing loan due to financial hardship; (b) how many of such appeals have been granted on compassionate grounds; and (c) whether the Ministry will change the rule for such applicants.","Mr Lawrence Wong: When the Lease Buyback Scheme (LBS) was first introduced in March 2009, HDB flat owners had to have an outstanding mortgage loan of no more than $5,000 to be eligible. Since February 2013, we have relaxed this requirement and allowed flat owners with outstanding mortgage loans of more than $5,000 to take up the LBS, as long as the proceeds from the lease sale is sufficient to fully discharge the loan."
review of government electronic business policy to encourage growth of nascent smes,"Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) whether the Government Electronic Business (GeBIZ) policy can be reviewed so that nascent small and medium-sized enterprises can qualify as Expenditure and Policies Procurement Unit Suppliers, or Building and Construction Authority Suppliers, and thus have more opportunities for growth; and (b) whether alternative modes of assessing a company's financial strength can be adopted in place of the current practice where historical financial statements are used.","Mr Heng Swee Keat: Government agencies typically conduct procurement via Tenders or Quotations. Tenders are called for higher value procurement, while Quotations are for procurement below a certain monetary threshold.Companies wishing to participate in government procurement by Tender may be required to qualify as Expenditure and Policies Procurement Unit Suppliers or Building and Construction Authority Suppliers with registration under the Government Registration Authority (GRA). GRA qualification is not necessary for Quotation level procurement.  Over 80% of all Government procurement opportunities are at Quotation-level and hence do not require GRA. This makes it easier for nascent Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to participate in government procurement. Suppliers need only have a GeBIZ Trading Partner account to bid for Quotations and there are no financial pre-requisites to be a GeBIZ Trading Partner. The first user account is also free. Earlier this year, we increased the upper limit of Quotations from $70,000 to $90,000, thus making even more procurement opportunities accessible to SMEs without GRA. This benefits the 12,000 existing suppliers who only participate in government quotations, as well as other new suppliers.  GRA is only required for some higher value procurement above $90,000 where Tenders are called, subject to the specific needs of the agency calling the Tender. Its primary objective is to provide assurance that a supplier has the capacity to deliver the goods or services that are paid for with public funds. There are different levels of GRA depending on the value of the Tender. If a supplier wishes to participate in a higher value procurement, he may be expected to have a higher financial capacity to qualify for a higher level GRA. To make GRA more accessible to SMEs, last year, we removed the requirement for companies with less than $5 million turnover to submit audited accounts when applying for non-construction related GRA. We now accept unaudited financial statements if the company’s Director certifies that their financial statements are accurate and true. About 3,900 GRA registered suppliers, or approximately 80%, have benefited from this.Finally, the supplier’s financial standing is just part of the whole suite of factors taken into consideration during evaluation. Other factors such as the quality of the proposal in meeting the objective and requirements of the procurement, including innovative elements, capability of the supplier and price are all considered. In fact, over 80% of procurement contracts in the past two years were awarded to SMEs.We will continue to review our policies and practices to ensure government procurement remains accessible to SMEs."
penalties for illegal smuggling of pet birds,Mr Yee Chia Hsing asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether there can be additional measures to ensure that pet bird shops do not get their sources from illegal smugglers of pet birds; and (b) whether the penalties for illegal smugglers can be increased to include caning and confiscation of vehicles used.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Importers are required to have the necessary health certificates and import permits to bring birds into Singapore. NParks works closely with Singapore Customs, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority, as well as local and international partners to carry out checks at Singapore's borders to combat bird smuggling.Under the Animals and Birds Act (ABA), those found guilty of smuggling animals may be fined up to $10,000 and/or face imprisonment of up to one year. The penalties are higher for offences involving endangered species protected under the Endangered Species (Import and Export) Act (ESA). In addition, smugglers found guilty of animal cruelty may be fined up to $15,000 and/or face imprisonment of up to 18 months for a first offence, with higher penalties for those who do so in the course of carrying on an animal-related business. NParks can also seize the vehicle used for smuggling.Pet shops are also required to maintain records of each bird that they have kept in their premises as part of NParks' pet shop licensing conditions. These records must include the source, import date, importer, date of reception, and date of sale of the bird. NParks conducts periodic unannounced checks at pet shops to ensure that the numbers and species of birds in the shops match import records. Under the ABA, shops found in breach of NParks' licensing conditions may be fined up to $5,000, and their licences may be suspended or revoked. Higher penalties may be imposed for offences involving endangered species protected under the ESA.NParks will continue to review these requirements and penalties to ensure that they remain robust and effective. "
variation of existing outsourced services contracts to factor in cost increases from changes in cpf contribution rates,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance whether guidelines will be given to the procurement departments in the Ministries and statutory boards to allow for a contract variation of their existing outsourced services contracts to factor in the possible cost increase that will be faced by service providers due to changes in CPF contribution rates or any policy-related changes that affect the wage cost.,"Mr Heng Swee Keat: The recent announcement on CPF contribution rates affect workers after the age of 55 years, and the intent is to restore the full CPF rate gradually taking into account economic conditions, over the next 10 years starting from 2021. Contractors bidding for Government contracts have advance notice to price their bids accordingly when they bid for contracts. The Prime Minister has also said in his 2019 National Day Rally speech that the Government will help businesses to adjust to these new arrangements through a support package and details will be announced in next year’s Budget. The approach taken by the Government is to give sufficient notice of changes that affect businesses, to help companies plan ahead. As nominal wage increases have averaged over 4% p.a. in the past 10 years, we expect most companies to be able to manage the planned 0.5-1% point increase in employers’ CPF contribution rate within the total wage increases in the coming years."
additional measures to tackle spam smses from illegal moneylenders and sports betting syndicates,Mr Yee Chia Hsing asked the Minister for Communications and Information whether additional measures can be introduced to tackle the issue of spam SMSes from illegal moneylenders and sports betting syndicates.,"Mr S Iswaran: The Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA) is working with the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and the Singapore Police Force (SPF) to counter spam SMSes that promote illicit activities such as illegal moneylending and sports betting. Such SMSes are typically sent using prepaid SIM cards. Hence, we have taken measures to curtail the abuse of prepaid SIM cards by criminal syndicates. For example, since 2014, we have reduced the number of prepaid SIM cards that a single person can own.  IMDA, MHA and SPF are studying other measures to tighten the prepaid SIM card regime. In addition, IMDA is working with the telecommunication service providers to explore technical solutions to reduce such SMSes being delivered.  As the public also plays an important part in this effort, SPF is stepping up efforts to increase public awareness through the use of infographics. Individuals can also take steps to block such SMSes by using the spam filtering functions on their phones. In addition, members of the public are advised to report unlicensed moneylending SMSes via the X-Ah Long Hotline (1800-924-5664) or SPF's I-Witness platform."
steps to ensure tourists and foreign visitors are familiar with pmd riding regulations,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Transport in respect of shared-PMD services, whether operating from private or public premises (a) what measures are in place to ensure that tourists and other foreign visitors are familiar with PMD riding regulations before they are allowed to rent the devices; and (b) whether such measures will be included in the operators' licensing requirements for both types of services.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Under the Parking Places Act, operators who wish to offer dockless PMD-sharing services in a public place are required to obtain a licence. LTA will require the licensees to include in their mobile applications the essential active mobility regulations, such as speed limits and prohibitions against riding on roads. They will remind all users of these regulations, before starting a trip. They will also be required to charge PMD-sharing users who fail to end their trips within a designated parking area, a $5 fee. This is to discourage indiscriminate parking. We are considering additional regulations to ensure that all shared devices are used safely.Separately, LTA has also encouraged PMD-sharing operators who operate solely on private land, to include in their mobile applications the advisory on the safe and responsible use of such devices."
former school sites returned to singapore land authority in past 10 years,"Mr Ang Wei Neng asked the Minister for Education (a) in the past 10 years, how many former school sites have been returned to the Singapore Land Authority (SLA); (b) how many former school sites are still left vacant as of 2019; (c) whether the Ministry has plans to re-develop these sites; and (d) as of 2019, how many former school sites have been renovated for a different use.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: MOE regularly reviews the use of former school sites under its care. If there are no plans for the sites, MOE will return them to the Singapore Land Authority (SLA).  Over the past 10 years, MOE has returned 30 former school sites to SLA. Another four sites are in the process of being returned. Of the 30 sites returned, eight have been demolished and redeveloped for a variety of uses, including public housing, while 12 have been repurposed into facilities like Special Education schools, childcare centres, foreign system schools, homes for the elderly, offices and even urban farms. For the remaining sites, SLA will continue to work with the relevant Government agencies to put them out either for adaptive reuse or for longer term redevelopment plans. MOE currently has about 25 former school sites, with the majority of these being used or set aside to be used as interim holding sites for schools undergoing upgrading. A few of these sites are pending development plans, for example, to use for Special Education schools."
review of punishment for pmd users causing injuries to pedestrians,Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for Transport whether LTA will review the punishment against riders of PMDs who cause injuries to pedestrians.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: We will take firm action against personal mobility device riders who cause injuries to pedestrians. They can be prosecuted under the Penal Code for an offence of causing hurt or grievous hurt through a rash or negligent act that endangers the personal safety of others. The penalty for causing grievous hurt through a rash act is a fine up to $10,000 and/or jail up to four years. The Ministry of Transport, Ministry of Home Affairs and other relevant agencies regularly monitor the effectiveness of the penalties at deterring errant riding behaviour, and will enhance penalties if necessary. "
review of punishment for sale of non-compliant pmds,Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for Transport whether LTA will review the punishment for selling non-compliant PMDs.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: We take a tough stance against retailers who advertise, display or sell non-compliant personal mobility devices (PMDs), as well as those who provide illegal device modification services. Those convicted of selling non-compliant PMDs for use on public paths may be liable to a fine up to $5,000 and/or jail up to three months for the first offence. We are considering raising the penalties to root out such irresponsible acts.                           "
update on amendment to protocol to the convention on limitation of liability to maritime claims,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Transport whether he can provide an update as to when will the 2012 Amendment to the 1996 Protocol to the Convention on Limitation of Liability to Maritime Claims (LLMC) 1976 be introduced in the Merchant Shipping Act.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: MPA will implement the 1996 Protocol in December this year, and with that raise the liability limits to the 2012 limits as required of all contracting states of the Protocol by updating the Schedule of the Merchant Shipping Act. "
requirement for advertisements for car loans to include effective interest rate calculation,"Mr Ong Teng Koon asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether the Ministry can consider requiring interest rates advertised for car loans to be calculated using the Effective Interest Rate method, which is based on the outstanding principal of the loan, instead of the Flat Rate method, which is based on the original principal of the loan.","Mr Chan Chun Sing: Lenders which extend car financing on a hire-purchase basis are required to comply with the disclosure requirements under the Hire Purchase Act. This includes disclosing the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) to consumers in writing before they enter into a hire purchase agreement. Other information which must be provided include interest rates for overdue instalments and administrative charges. If these information are not provided prior to signing of the agreement, the agreement will not be enforceable. In addition, banks, which provide the bulk of car financing today, are also expected to include the EIR in their advertisement of loan products, including car loans, as set out in the Code of Advertising Practice issued by the Association of Banks in Singapore. We strongly encourage consumers to review the terms of car loan agreements carefully and assess their ability to meet the financial commitments before entering into any agreement."
"provisions for singapore government vessels, aircraft and resources to assist malaysian authorities in search and rescue operations in malaysian territorial waters near singapore","Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs (a) whether there are provisions for Singapore Government vessels, aircraft and resources to assist Malaysian authorities in search and rescue operations in Malaysian territorial waters near Singapore; (b) if so, to what extent; and (c) whether such provisions will be reviewed in light of the recent case of two Singaporean kayakers lost at sea near Mersing, Malaysia.","Dr Vivian Balakrishnan: I would begin by expressing our deepest sympathies to the families of the two Singaporeans, Mdm Phua Geok Tin and Mr Tan Eng Soon, who were the victims of a tragic incident while kayaking in the sea near Mersing, Malaysia on 8 August 2019. The group leader informed the Malaysian authorities that Mdm Phua and Mr Tan were missing on the morning of 9 August 2019. When MFA was informed later that afternoon, we immediately contacted the relevant Malaysian authorities to also seek their urgent assistance for the search and rescue (SAR) operations as the incident took place in Malaysia's territorial waters. We also immediately alerted members of both families of the incident and offered our assistance. An intensive SAR operation was coordinated by the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA) over the next 10 days. MFA officers were deployed on the ground to coordinate with the Malaysian authorities and to provide consular support to the families, at the search site. Their kayak was found on 13 August, and the body of Mdm Phua was subsequently found on 14 August. Unfortunately, the search for Mr Tan has been inconclusive. While the SAR operations have ended, the Malaysian authorities have asked vessels and fishermen to continue to look out for Mr Tan. We also remain in contact with the families in case they require further assistance in the wake of this tragic incident.There are long standing existing arrangements for Singapore to assist the Malaysian authorities (and vice versa) in such SAR operations, subject to the permission of the country responsible for the maritime search and rescue region. MPA, who coordinates Singapore's maritime SAR operations, reached out to its Malaysian counterpart to offer Singapore's assistance. MPA also alerted its Indonesian and Thai counterparts to look out and report any sightings, and initiated a Maritime Safety Information broadcast to the shipping community to be on the lookout.While our offer of assistance was not taken up, Malaysia conducted an intensive SAR operation lasting 10 days. This is beyond the usual period of their SAR operations. Malaysia deployed 5 aircrafts, 11 naval vessels and patrol boats and 155 ground personnel in very challenging conditions. They covered a vast area of waters off the Malaysian states of Johor, Pahang and Terengganu. We are especially grateful to the Malaysian government and all Malaysian agencies and personnel who were involved in the SAR operations. We were also heartened by the support and assistance of ordinary Malaysians from all walks of life, especially the fishermen in the area who played a critical role in the recovery efforts. I called Malaysian Home Affairs Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin shortly after the end of the SAR operations to personally express Singapore's deep appreciation. He also assured me that Malaysia will follow up if there is any significant new information on the search for Mr Tan.  Malaysia's efforts in finding the two Singaporeans is a reflection of how, as close neighbours, we have always come to the assistance of each other in such unfortunate incidents. We will continue to work closely with our foreign counterparts to maintain these strong ties at all levels.I need to remind Singaporeans participating in outdoor leisure activities overseas to e-register with MFA and be mindful that certain sporting activities, especially in open seas, may carry risks. Appropriate safety and contingency plans should be prepared. When in doubt, Singaporeans should consult the relevant professional bodies or sporting associations for specific advice."
number of households with persons with disabilities and help measures available,Mr Chong Kee Hiong asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what is the current number of households with persons with disabilities (PwDs); and (b) what measures are available to assist them financially and with respite care.,"Mr Desmond Lee: The Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) currently does not have data on the number of households with persons with disabilities. We are working with the Department of Statistics to include this and other disability-related questions in the next population census to be conducted in 2020. There is a range of financial support and subsidies for persons with disabilities across different life stages. Depending on their household income and financial circumstances, they may qualify for financial assistance schemes, such as ComCare Long-Term Assistance, Short-to- Medium-Term Assistance and Student Care Subsidies. Low-income persons with disabilities and their families are also eligible for various disability schemes across life stages.At the pre-school stage, all Government-funded centres that offer the Early Intervention Programme for Infants and Children (EIPIC) have schemes in place to help families subsidise EIPIC fees. There is also another subsidy scheme, the Enhanced Pilot for Private Intervention Providers (PPIP), for parents with children enrolled in selected private intervention centres (PICs). Financial subsidies are also available to caregivers of students in Government-funded Special Education (SPED) schools. This includes the SPED Financial Assistance Scheme to help eligible students get a full waiver of school fees, free textbooks and free school attire. SPED schools are also given a grant for Discretionary Financial Assistance (DFA), to be given out by the school. Like all other students, Singaporean students with disabilities in mainstream schools can also qualify for financial assistance based on their family's financial circumstances. After graduation, persons with disabilities may enrol in government-funded services such as Day Activity Centres (DAC) and Sheltered Workshops. While DAC fees may vary based on the programme that the client is enrolled in, low income families are given more subsidies to keep the fees affordable. Care-givers can also tap on the Foreign Domestic Worker Levy Concession and the Foreign Domestic Worker Grant for persons with disabilities to defray the cost of employing a foreign domestic worker to look after family members with disabilities. Working care-givers may also qualify for tax reliefs if they are supporting spouses, children, parents or siblings with disabilities.There are also several schemes administered by SG Enable to financially support persons with disabilities to live independently in their homes and the community. For instance, the Assistive Technology Fund subsidises up to 90% of the cost of buying, replacing and repairing assistive technology devices that help them to live independently. These schemes also include various transport subsidies such as the Public Transport Concession Scheme for persons with disabilities, Voluntary Welfare Organisation (VWO) Transport Subsidies, Taxi Subsidy Scheme, and the Disabled Persons Scheme to support persons with disabilities who are unable to use public transport and require a vehicle to earn a living. Low-wage Singaporeans with disabilities can also benefit from two Workfare schemes to increase their wages and enhance their skills. The Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) tops up the salaries and CPF savings of low-wage workers, with up to $3,600 in cash and CPF contributions annually, while the Workfare Training Support (WTS) scheme provides support to encourage low-wage workers to upgrade their skills. SG Enable also helps job-ready persons with disabilities to look for employment.Respite care services are currently provided by nine Adult Disability Homes and three Children Disability Homes. These services are offered to families of persons with disabilities who may need short-term assistance in providing care for their loved ones. Caregivers seeking respite care services should approach SG Enable if they require information or support."
upcoming increase in subsidies for pre-school education,"Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Social and Family Development in view of the upcoming increase in subsidies for pre-school education, how will the Ministry guard against undue fee increases from operators that will negate the effectiveness of such subsidy support to parents.","20 Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for Social and Family Development what measures will the Ministry put in place to prevent pre-school operators from taking advantage of the recently announced higher subsidies to parents by raising their pre-school fees. Mr Desmond Lee: Today, MOE Kindergartens1, Anchor Operators and Partner Operators provide slightly over half of all pre-school places. Anchor Operators and Partner Operators are subject to fee caps stipulated by the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA), and are required to ensure that any fee increase is moderate and their fees do not exceed the caps. In fact, the fee caps for Anchor Operators and Partner Operators have been maintained at their current levels since 2014 and 2016 respectively. Each year, some Anchor Operator or Partner Operator centres that charge below the fee caps may make some moderate fee adjustments to maintain sustainability. However, the fee caps help to moderate any increase in fees for a significant proportion of the pre-school sector. The remaining half of pre-schools are provided by private and not-for-profit operators. Like childcare centres that are under the Anchor Operator and Partner Operator schemes, families whose children attend these private and not-for-profit childcare centres also receive the Basic Subsidy and means-tested Additional Subsidy.But these operators are not subject to fee caps and have flexibility in setting their fees. We recognise that fees may be adjusted from time to time in response to market conditions and operational costs. By and large, most pre-schools seek to ensure that their fee increases are not excessive, in order to remain competitive and attractive to parents.All preschools are required to inform parents and ECDA of any increase in fees by 1 September of the preceding year, so that parents can make an informed choice about their child's pre-school. Over the next few years, parents will increasingly have more affordable and quality pre-school options to choose from, as we increase the number of Anchor Operator and Partner Operator preschools and add a few more MOE kindergartens. By around 2025, the share of Anchor Operator, Partner Operator and MOE pre-school places will rise to 8 in 10. In the medium term, as Government-supported pre-schools grow, we will lower their fee caps so that parents will pay around the equivalent of primary school fees plus after-school student care fees for full-day pre-school, before means-tested subsidies.Already, Government-supported operators have helped to stabilise pre-school fees in the sector. Median full-day childcare fees fell for the first time in 2016 when the Partner Operator scheme was introduced, and have been maintained since. We expect median fees to be brought down further when we expand the Partner Operator scheme to bring in more pre-schools in 2021, along with a lowering of their fee cap from the current $800 (before GST) per month for full-day childcare.  Increasingly, parents will enjoy more access to affordable and quality pre-schools for their children. This ensures a good start for every child and strong support for parents in raising their families. "
impact of withdrawal of market access rights to eu on singapore's financial institutions,Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Prime Minister (a) what will be the impact of the withdrawal of market access rights to the European Union on our financial institutions; (b) what is the Government doing to mitigate the impact; and (c) how rigorous is our regulation of crediting ratings agencies as compared with that of the EU.,"31 Ms Tin Pei Ling asked the Prime Minister (a) what are the implications of the European Commission's decision to withdraw some market access rights of Singapore; (b) how may this affect investor confidence; and (c) what may be the interpretations of this move against the broader developments around the world.Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): Some media reports might have given the impression that the European Commission (EC) is reducing its market access to financial institutions in Singapore. This is not true. There continues to be no impediment, for financial services provided out of Singapore to customers in the European Union (EU). There has also been no impact on investors’ confidence in Singapore. Let me explain. The EC's decision covers only Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) and does not extend to any other financial services. Further, the EC recognises CRAs in a third country through two approaches:First, deeming the third country's CRA rules as equivalent to EC rules. This is called the equivalence decision; Second, an endorsement approach, where the CRAs in the third country rely on their related entities in the EU to endorse their ratings.  CRAs in Singapore have been using the endorsement approach, and the EC has confirmed that it will continue to recognise Singapore-based CRAs using this approach.   Having said that, equivalence is the highest form of market integration, which CRAs in Singapore, like those in several other jurisdictions, no longer enjoy. The reason has to do with the different approaches taken by major regulators internationally. Dr Lim asked how MAS’ regulations on CRAs compare to those in the EU. Mr Leon Perera also raised a similar question for the next Parliament Sitting. MAS' CRA regulatory regime is based on, and consistent with, standards promulgated by the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), which is the global standard setting body. The EC has assessed MAS' CRA regulatory regime to be less prescriptive than EU rules in certain areas, such as in defining specific situations in which a conflict of interest for the CRA arises. MAS takes a more principles-based approach. It nevertheless requires conflicts of interest to be effectively addressed, and is fully in line with international standards and appropriate to our context and needs.   Singapore is in good standing with the EU. We have EC recognition on a broad range of other financial services, including for over-the-counter derivatives trading venues and central counterparties. In July 2019, we were one of the first two jurisdictions to obtain EC equivalence for financial benchmarks regulation. MAS will continue to closely engage our EU counterparts in reviewing our rules to ensure that financial institutions in Singapore continue to have access to the EU market in various financial services. "
monies wrongly credited into bank accounts,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Prime Minister (a) whether there is an increasing number of cases of monies wrongly credited by a person to a bank account of an individual; and (b) whether our banks are required to freeze such monies and return them to the rightful sender and, if not, why.","Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): With the growth in electronic funds transfers, there have been some reported cases where monies were transferred by bank customers to unintended recipients. This can happen when a person makes typographical errors while setting out the e-payment instructions, but such instances are rare. When such an erroneous transfer occurs, the bank should help by engaging the recipient's bank, so that the recipient is informed and a refund can be initiated. It is an offence under the Penal Code for the recipient to retain or use the funds when he has been informed that it was sent by mistake. If the wrongful recipient refuses to return the erroneously transferred monies, the sender should make a police report.  Er Dr Lee asked whether banks are required to freeze and automatically return monies to a sender when a sender says the monies were wrongly transferred. It would not be appropriate to impose such an automatic requirement on banks. First, a bank cannot be sure that the sender made a mistake. Second, automatically returning the monies to the sender will run the risk of abuse, and does not encourage more careful use of e-payment and transfers. For example, a person who pays for an online purchase could subsequently ask his bank to reverse the payment upon receipt of the goods, claiming that the transaction was in error, and the banks are none the wiser.  To address the concerns relating to erroneous transfers, MAS has issued a set of guidelines to protect e-payments users. Under the guidelines, consumers will need to play their part and be responsible for accurate payments. On the banks' part, they have to make reasonable efforts to assist the sender, as I have mentioned. And in the case of fraud, consumers should report to the Police promptly. MAS will continue to work with the industry to raise consumer literacy and awareness on how to minimise wrongful e-payments. As in the case of cheques, the banks' role is to ensure that all properly authenticated payment instructions are processed effectively and efficiently. And as customers, we all know we have to write our cheques accurately and properly."
appeals in past 10 years for hdb rental flats on grounds of dispute with children,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development in the past 10 years, (a) what is the total number of appeals for HDB rental flats which cite reasons of disagreement with children, disowned by children or got chased out/abused by children; (b) what is the number of such cases wherein the children live in (i) HDB flats or (ii) private property; (c) how many of such appeals have been successful; and (d) what are the conditions for such approval.","Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB only started tracking data on such cases from 2016 onwards. From 2016 to May 2019, HDB received about 2,600 public rental requests from parents with children who should have been able to provide housing for them. The common reason cited for their rental request was conflict with their children. About 560 requests were acceded to, based on the specific circumstances of each person. HDB does not track whether their children were living in HDB flats or private residential properties. We encourage rental applicants who face conflict with their children to first seek mediation assistance from a Family Service Centre. If they are still unable to reconcile, and if the children have no means to provide alternative housing for their parents, HDB will help such seniors with a public rental flat.  Seniors whose children have the means to provide for them can also consider making an application for maintenance at the Tribunal for the Maintenance of Parents.  "
lowering minimum age for hdb lease buyback scheme for owners needing long-term medical treatment for chronic illnesses,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development whether the Government will consider lowering the minimum age requirement for the HDB Lease Buyback Scheme for flat owners who need long-term medical treatment for chronic illnesses.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The qualifying age for LBS is set at the CPF Payout Eligibility Age of 65 to allow seniors to receive their monthly CPF payouts immediately after they take up the LBS. Nevertheless, HDB is prepared to and has exercised flexibility on the age requirement for those with long term medical expenses.We thank the Member for his feedback and will take it into consideration as we continue to review our schemes."
additional measures to address rise in youth suicides,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Social and Family Development in view of the rise in youth suicides, whether the Ministry will consider shifting the current strategy or introducing additional measures to address this trend.","Mr Desmond Lee: The number of suicides involving 10- to 19-year-olds fluctuates year-on-year, ranging from 12 to 27 cases in the past five years. While there is no discernible trend, MOE, MOH and MSF are very concerned about youth suicides and we are monitoring this closely. The underlying causes of suicide are complex, so a multi-pronged approach has been taken to prevent suicide. This includes:(a) building resilience and supporting mental well-being among young people; (b) raising awareness on mental health issues;(c) reducing stigma and encouraging youths to seek help if they are experiencing mental health difficulties;(d) identifying and supporting those at risk of suicide; and (e) intervening in crisis situations where urgent help is needed. MSF works closely with agencies such as MOE, MOH, MHA, the Institute of Mental Health, the Health Promotion Board, the National Council of Social Service, and with community partners such as the Samaritans of Singapore on these inter-agency efforts. For example, the Health Promotion Board partners schools on psycho-emotional programmes to equip students with skills to manage stress and emotions, and build supportive relationships with peers. Students may also be referred to school counsellors and mental health professionals such as the Child Guidance Clinic, where necessary. Beyond schools, the Samaritans of Singapore or SOS conducts programmes to teach teenagers how to identify suicide warning signs and where to seek help. SOS also runs a 24-hour crisis hotline, manned by trained adult volunteers, to counsel persons in distress.  In addition, an Inter-Agency Research Workgroup for Youth Suicides has been set up as part of the recommendations by the NurtureSG Taskforce. The Workgroup, led by IMH, has been studying the issues surrounding youth suicides, and facilitates deeper collaboration between the various agencies. The Workgroup seeks to deepen its understanding of risk factors as well as protective factors surrounding suicides, and consider ways to better raise awareness and support for our youths. More recently in May this year, Parliament passed the Criminal Law Reform Bill to amend the Penal Code to decriminalise attempted suicide, because the threat of prosecution and the labelling of persons who attempt suicide as ""offenders"" may worsen their emotional state and the stigma they face. At the same time, the abetment of attempted suicide remains an offence, and the Police will continue to be able to intervene in suicide situations.  Every life is precious, and each suicide is one too many. We will continue to work together to strengthen our national response for suicide prevention."
measures taken to ensure early detection and efficient deployment of resources to handle vegetation fires,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Home Affairs in view of the increased frequency of vegetation fires in 2019, what intermediate and long-term measures are being taken to ensure the early detection and efficient deployment of resources to handle such fires.","Mr K Shanmugam: The number of vegetation fires has increased in recent years due to factors such as drier and hotter weather. The number in the first half of 2019 increased by 56% to 555, from 356 in the first half of 2018. The inter-agency Wildfire Task Force Committee led by SCDF coordinates measures to minimise the risk of vegetation fires. During the dry season, members will step up patrols of hotspots to enable early detection, as well as adopt preventive measures such as removing dead leaves more regularly. For example, NParks has increased patrols and inspections of nature reserves, parks and other vegetated areas to look out for possible fire hazards such as dry leaf litter, and signs of incipient fire. In addition, it is exploring the use of video analytics and drones, and has constructed fire breaks to hinder the spread of fires in nature reserves.SCDF educates members of the public on steps that they can take to prevent and counter such fires. For example, extinguish embers properly if they have started a controlled fire, and don’t discard refractive materials like broken glass into the vegetation, which could focus the sunlight and start a fire. Smokers should not dispose of their cigarette butts illegally.   In fact, those who illegally discard cigarette butts can be charged not only under the Environmental Public Health Act for littering, but also under the Penal Code for negligent conduct, should there be a major fire thereafter. The amended Penal Code, which will come into force in 2020, will empower the Police and SCDF to take even firmer action, by introducing a new offence of causing or contributing to the risk of a dangerous fire, and a presumption clause. In future, should a fire happen within 60 minutes at the place where someone had illegally disposed of a cigarette butt, the person would be presumed to be culpable for the fire and duly charged. This makes it harder for offenders to escape justice. "
recent spike in typhoid fever cases,"Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked the Minister for Health regarding the recent spike in typhoid fever cases (a) whether this was a local outbreak or from imported cases; (b) whether the patients were returning Singaporeans, residents, foreign workers or visitors; and (c) what measures are being planned to address the situation other than heightened surveillance.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Between 26 July and 29 August 2019, MOH was notified of 26 typhoid fever cases, comprising of 21 local and five imported cases. The local cases did not have recent travel history. Preliminary genetic analysis conducted on available typhoid bacteria samples from 18 of the local cases showed that they were similar, which suggest that the cases could be linked to a common source. MOH and the Singapore Food Agency have been working together to investigate the cases. We have conducted checks at food establishments and caterers where the cases had consumed food from, traced food sources, collected food and water samples for testing, and screened food handlers to try to identify the source of infection. Thus far, none of the food and water samples tested, or food handlers screened, tested positive for Salmonella Typhi. No common food establishment or upstream source has been identified to date. Investigations by MOH and SFA are ongoing. MOH has alerted the medical community to remain vigilant and report typhoid fever cases. We have also screened household members of the affected cases, and advised them to seek treatment if they develop symptoms.Typhoid fever, like other food-borne diseases, can be prevented through general hygiene measures, including proper hand hygiene, and safe handling, cooking and consumption of food. MOH and SFA will continue with investigations, and are closely monitoring the situation. Should the source of the outbreak be identified, MOH and SFA will provide an update and issue a public advisory on any additional precautions that members of the public should take."
number of persons with disabilities benefitting from assistive technology fund in past three years,"Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Social and Family Development for the past three years (a) how many persons with disabilities have benefited from the Assistive Technology Fund (ATF); (b) what is the total amount disbursed under ATF; (c) whether there have been appeals for further disbursements beyond the $40,000 cap; and (d) if so, what is the total number of appeals.","Mr Desmond Lee: The Assistive Technology Fund (ATF), administered by SG Enable, is a subsidy scheme to help persons with disabilities to defray the cost of buying, replacing, upgrading and repairing assistive devices. The Fund covers devices used for rehabilitation, education, employment, early intervention, training and independent living. In the Financial Year 2018, a total of 2,037 persons with disabilities benefitted from the ATF, an increase from 1,450 and 1,808 persons with disabilities in FY16 and FY17 respectively. The total amount disbursed over the past three years was $10 million. Thus far, MSF and SG Enable have not received any appeals for further disbursements beyond the $40,000 individual cap under the ATF. Persons with disabilities who require information and advice on the use of assistive technology can also visit Tech Able, an integrated assistive technology space at the Enabling Village. They can view a range of assistive technology solutions, as well as receive services such as assessment and advice by on-site specialists.MSF is committed to support the adoption of assistive technology among persons with disabilities as this can help to maintain and improve the functional capabilities of the individual, and allow them to better integrate into society. We have set up a cross-sectoral workgroup under the 3rd Enabling Masterplan this year, which will further look at how technology and design can be leveraged to support independent living for persons with disabilities. "
number of non-medical care related admissions into public hospitals,Ms Irene Quay Siew Ching asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the current number of non-medical care related admissions into public hospitals; (b) what are the common conditions for which patients are admitted for non-medical care; and (c) whether a review will be carried out to ensure parity between outpatient and inpatient MediSave/Approved Integrated Shield claimable limits for these conditions so that hospital beds can be more efficiently utilised for cases requiring urgent medical attention.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Patients are hospitalised at the public hospitals only when they have a clear clinical need for admission. There have been a very small number of admissions due to non-medical circumstances. Examples include new-born babies who are well but are admitted as their mothers remained unfit for discharge after delivery, or patients who are well but unable to be discharged as they lack a caregiving arrangement. The number of these non-medical admissions have remained low at between 0.01% to 0.03% of all admissions in the past five years.  With advances in medical science and changes in care models, some medical treatments that previously required patients to be admitted can be delivered effectively in an ambulatory or outpatient setting. As some of these treatments may remain costly, MOH will review and consider them for MediShield Life and MediSave coverage, as appropriate. As an example, MediShield Life and MediSave can now be claimed by multiple myeloma patients who continue their autologous bone marrow transplants in the outpatient setting, potentially allowing these patients to shorten their hospitalisation stays by up to three weeks. "
measures to ensure electricity retailers take all necessary safeguards to protect consumers' identities,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what measures will be put in place to ensure that electricity retailers take all necessary safeguards to protect consumers' identities; and (b) what recourse do consumers have when they find that their identities have been used to sign up for electricity accounts or their identity details have been compromised.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: All electricity retailers must comply with the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) when collecting, using and disclosing personal data. This includes making reasonable security arrangements to protect their data. There are additional safeguards in EMA's Code of Conduct for Electricity Retail Licensees. For example, when signing up consumers, retailers are required to obtain the consumer’s consent or proper authorisation before entering into a contract. EMA carries out Mystery Shopper Audits to assess if retailers are in compliance with the Code of Conduct.Consumers who find that their identities have been compromised, or used to sign up for electricity accounts without their consent, should first approach the retailer to resolve the issue. In the event of an unauthorised switch, consumers will be able to terminate the contract without incurring early termination charges. Consumers who encounter errant retailers can contact CASE or EMA. EMA will take action against any retailer that is found to have breached the Code of Conduct. Such retailers could be suspended from signing up new customers and can be subjected to financial penalties.Consumers who have reason to believe that their personal data has been used or disclosed by a retailer in violation of the PDPA can report it to the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC). Retailers who breach the PDPA may be subject to financial penalties of up to $1 million."
impact of surge in chinese developers in residential property market in past five years,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for National Development whether the surge of Chinese developers in the residential property market in the past five years has caused problems in property speculation, over-pricing of land sales and poor construction quality.","Mr Lawrence Wong: The private residential property market has largely been stable over the last five years. But there was a brief surge in property prices from 2H2017 to 1H2018 as market sentiments improved. Developers, both local and foreign, were bidding more aggressively for land. So this bidding behavior was not limited to Chinese developers, who accounted for less than 10% of the private residential sites sold via the Government Land Sales programme and en-bloc sales during this period. In terms of prices, the winning bids by Chinese developers were also comparable to those of other developers.In terms of construction quality, one objective measure is the Construction Quality Assessment System (CONQUAS) administered by the BCA. The average CONQUAS score for private residential projects has been increasing over the years, and has remained high over the last five years. The average CONQUAS score for projects by Chinese developers is comparable to that of the national average.The Government will continue to monitor trends in the property market, and adjust our policies as necessary, to provide good quality homes, and maintain a stable and sustainable property market."
average time for selection process for applicants given ballot number for hdb bto flats,Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for National Development what is the average length of time for the selection process involving all applicants who have been given a ballot number following the balloting exercise for HDB BTO flats and what steps may be taken to accelerate the process.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Since the May 2019 BTO exercise, HDB has reduced the balloting time for BTO flats from six weeks to three weeks. This means that three weeks after the sales exercise, applicants will be notified of their queue number. Thereafter, they will be invited to select a unit in sequence. It takes around four to six months for the flat selection to be completed. This is because HDB has to schedule individual appointments for every applicant, and take the time to engage them, and assist them in making their flat selections. HDB will continue to explore ways to streamline and expedite the selection process.  "
update on cad's investigation of chairman and management of swiber holdings and related companies,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) has now completed its investigation of the chairman and management of Swiber Holdings and its related companies; (b) if so, whether CAD will proceed with any charges for any offences; and (c) if not, when is the investigation expected to complete.",Mr K Shanmugam: Police investigations into Swiber Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries are still ongoing. It is inappropriate for me to comment further. 
steps taken to increase variety of part-time work options for mothers returning to work,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Manpower what steps are being taken to increase the variety of part-time work options for mothers who are wanting to return to work after having children.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: Based on a 2016 Marriage and Parenthood survey conducted by the Prime Minister's Office, women with children below six years have strong preference for ""full-time work with flexible work arrangements (FWAs)"" rather than ""part-time work""1. For every woman who would prefer part-time work, there are around two to three women who would prefer full-time work with FWAs. The Government supports working mothers through (i) promoting FWAs, (ii) providing more affordable childcare support, and (iii) providing employment facilitation services including for part-time work. Firstly, to encourage more companies to meet their employees' FWA needs, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) increased the Work-Life Grant budget from $30 million to $100 million, and will continue to actively promote the Tripartite Standard on FWAs with tripartite partners. Through the concerted efforts by tripartite partners, FWAs are now more common. More than nine in 10 employees today work in companies that provide some form of work flexibility2. Among those who need FWAs, more than eight in 10 employees have access to the FWA that they need3.Secondly, the Government has also improved the accessibility, affordability and quality of pre-school services, to provide parents with greater assurance that their children are in good hands. We have doubled full-day pre-school capacity, from around 90,000 in 2012, to almost 180,000 places today. We will increase pre-school subsidies significantly from next year. These moves help working mothers4, including those on part-time work, as subsidies are provided for those who work at least 56 hours a month. Thirdly, mothers who have left the workforce for longer periods of time may need additional help to find jobs, including part-time work options. To support the return of women back into the labour force, the Adapt and Grow initiative offers a suite of employment facilitation services and programmes to help jobseekers enter new jobs and overcome mismatches in skills, wages or job expectations. One of these programmes is Career Trial, which provides an opportunity for jobseekers and employers to try each other out and assess job fit. During the trial, which can be up to three months, jobseekers receive a training allowance from the Government. To allow those who prefer to work part-time to access more job opportunities, the Career Trial was enhanced in May this year to include part-time jobs. Jobseekers who need career assistance can visit WSG's Careers Connect and NTUC-Employment and Employability Institute's (NTUC-e2i's) career centres."
strategic plan to develop social entrepreneurship and social enterprises in singapore and overseas,Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what is the strategic plan for the development of social entrepreneurship and social enterprises in Singapore; (b) what support do local social enterprises (SEs) have for expanding overseas; (c) whether there are plans to work across Ministries and leverage on Enterprise Singapore's resources to create a special scale-up programme for SEs; and (d) whether SEs will continue to be positioned as an extension of social service agencies or is the sector now ready to be seen as businesses in the private sector.,"Mr Desmond Lee: Social enterprises play an important role in our social service landscape, in providing impactful and innovative solutions to address social needs. As business entities with clear social goals, they lie between for-profit businesses and charities, by pursuing the double bottom line of both financial performance and social impact. Hence, they are entities distinct from social service agencies, which are non-profits or charities. Recognising that social enterprises require support and encouragement, MSF set up the Singapore Centre for Social Enterprise, or raiSE, in 2015, with the strategic aim of nurturing social enterprises. As a sector developer, raiSE provides capacity building and funding support for social enterprises to grow both their businesses and social impact. The VentureForGood (VFG) grant under raiSE, which is funded by MSF, aims to support social enterprises that are starting up or expanding their operations, with up to $300,000 in grants. As at end-FY2018, raiSE has supported more than 120 social enterprises with committed funding of over $11 million under VFG. There are no plans to create another separate scale-up programme for social enterprises, as social enterprises are able to leverage existing grants and support under raiSE and Enterprise Singapore to accelerate growth and scale. raiSE will continue to provide advisory services to guide social enterprises in navigating the available resources and support. In addition to funding support, raiSE is also building up an ecosystem of support for social enterprises, and equipping social enterprises with the requisite skills, knowledge and capabilities. To this end, raiSE has launched masterclasses, mentorship programmes, and provided strategic coaching in collaboration with industry partners and like-minded individuals who support social enterprises. They have also provided networking platforms for social enterprises to engage industry experts and increase understanding of social issues to co-create impact. Regionally, raiSE is exploring the formation of an informal network of social enterprise sector developers, to facilitate the exchange of ideas between social enterprises within ASEAN, and eventually support our social enterprises in gaining access to markets outside Singapore."
impact to singapore's economy in view of prolonged social tensions in hong kong,"Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Trade and Industry in view of the prolonged social tensions in Hong Kong, what are the near and long term impacts to Singapore's economy.","Mr Chan Chun Sing: Hong Kong is an important business and financial centre in Asia, and shares close trade and investment ties with many regional economies, including Singapore. For Singapore, Hong Kong was our fifth largest trading partner in 2018, and fourth largest investment destination as at end-2017. We are monitoring developments in Hong Kong with concern, as continued disruptions to Hong Kong's stability will have negative spillover impact on Singapore and the region given these close linkages.  To-date, Singapore's economy has not been significantly affected by the developments in Hong Kong. MTI estimates that the total value-added that Singapore derives from Hong Kong's final demand amounts to 1.2% of Singapore's GDP. However, businesses with strong dependence on Hong Kong may see a greater impact. For instance:(a) Some of our trade-related services such as wholesale trade as well as transportation and storage are more exposed to the developments in Hong Kong, as Hong Kong is a significant exports destination for Singapore. Thus far, feedback from the companies in these sectors indicates that they have not been severely affected. (b) Some Singapore businesses with operations in the lifestyle and retail sectors in Hong Kong have been more directly affected by the developments in Hong Kong. Our economic agencies are in touch with these businesses and monitoring the situation closely. Over the longer term, if the current situation in Hong Kong persists and adds to global economic uncertainty, investor confidence will likely be adversely affected. This will in turn weigh on investments and economic activities in the region. Singapore, as well as other regional economies, benefit from a stable and predictable operating environment. With increased uncertainty, the impact on Singapore's economy is likely to be larger. As Hong Kong is an important market and economic partner for Singapore, we hope that there will be a peaceful resolution to the situation in Hong Kong soon."
eligibility and selection criteria for national day awards nomination,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Prime Minister (a) what is the eligibility and selection criteria for nominations for National Day Awards; (b) who can nominate and what is the end-to-end award process; (c) whether there is a fixed number of awards given out for each category every year and, if yes, what are they; and (d) what is the total number of awards given to grassroots leaders every year.","Mr Chan Chun Sing (for the Prime Minister): The eligibility criteria for National Day Awards are governed by the various gazetted medal rules. Individuals who have rendered outstanding public service or distinguished themselves in the field of arts and letters, sports, the sciences, business, the professions and the labour movement are eligible for National Day Awards. We also have awards that recognise public and military officers for gallantry, distinguished service or long service. The type of award which individuals may be eligible for depends on their achievements, contributions and service. Every year, the Prime Minister's Office invites nominations from the public and non-public sector through Ministries, Organs of State and Advisors of Grassroots Organisations. The nominations are then evaluated by various committees. The final shortlist is submitted for the President’s approval.  The medal rules do not cap the number of awards except for the Medal of Honour, which is limited to four in any one year, the Certificate of Honour which is limited to six in any one year and the Order of Temasek (With High Distinction) which is limited to 12 recipients. Notwithstanding this, to ensure the prestige of the other awards and that only the most deserving are awarded, we cap the number that agencies can put up where practical. The caps vary depending on the pool of eligible candidates and the awards.  The total number of awards given to grassroots leaders ranged from 189 to 191 between 2016 and 2019. "
review income ceiling under public rental scheme to ensure relevance to household incomes and expenditure,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether the Ministry will review the income ceiling under the public rental scheme for HDB flats given that the latest Household Expenditure Survey shows that the average monthly expenditure in 1-2 room flats is now $1,545, which exceeds the present public rental income ceiling of $1,500; and (b) what expenditure studies, surveys, or other evidence are used to determine whether the income ceiling under the public rental scheme remains relevant to contemporary household incomes and standards of living.","Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB takes a needs-based approach for households applying for rental flats. $1,500 is used as an indication of income, because first-timer households with this income are able to buy a new flat with the help of our generous housing grants, and we want to encourage them to own their own homes. But this income figure is a guideline, and not a hard cap. Households with income over $1,500 can still apply for rental flats. HDB will consider their individual circumstances to assess their housing budget and options. At the Committee of Supply earlier this year, MND shared that from 2016 to 2018, 590 households with incomes above $1,500 were assisted with public rental housing. Since then, from January to July 2019, about 170 more households have been assisted. HDB will continue to review the Public Rental Scheme regularly to ensure that it meets the housing needs of Singaporeans who are not able to purchase their own homes.  "
statistics on unsuccessful first-timer applicants for hdb flats,Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for National Development (a) how many first-timer applicants for HDB flats have not been successful in getting a flat at each of the last four quarterly sales exercises; and (b) what are the components behind the algorithm that assigns the computerised ballot number for flat buyers.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The number of unsuccessful applicants for the 2019 Build-To-Order (BTO) exercises in February and May are not available as flat selections are still ongoing. For the two BTO exercises in August and November 2018, about 990 and 4,200 first-timer families respectively were unsuccessful in their attempt to apply for a flat. Demand for some of the BTO projects in November 2018 was particularly strong due to their good location and shorter waiting time. First-timer families who have been unsuccessful in two applications in non-mature estates will receive one additional ballot chance per subsequent application in non-mature estates. As a result, over the past two years, among the first-timer families who applied for a BTO flat in non-mature estates, all have been successful by their third attempt.  The balloting process essentially selects a certain number of flat applicants based on the number of flats on offer and assigns them a queue number. The process is randomised but will take into account various factors, including the ethnic quotas for the various buyer groups, the applicants’ household status, and the priority schemes the applicants are eligible for. The balloting process is audited to ensure that it is fair to all applicants."
number of cases of illegal rental in illegally partitioned apartment exceeding occupancy cap,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for National Development (a) how many cases of illegal rental in illegally partitioned apartment units that exceed the occupancy cap have been caught in the past three years; and (b) what are the penalties for parties involved in the abetment of such offences.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The occupancy cap for private residential properties was tightened from eight to six persons in 2017. Since then, URA has detected and enforced against approximately 800 such infringements. The penalties for exceeding the occupancy cap are calibrated according to the severity of the offence. For example, for marginal breaches, URA may issue a composition fine of up to $5,000. For more serious cases, URA will seek stiffer penalties through prosecution. Any person found guilty can be fined up to $200,000 or face imprisonment of up to 12 months. In situations where property agents are involved in abetting the offence, URA and CEA will take action, which could include debarring the agent for a period of time. Similarly, MOM will also take enforcement action against errant employers and foreign workers involved in such offences."
regulatory licensing of point-to-point transport sector,"Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for Trade and Industry in view of the new regulatory licensing of the point-to-point transport sector, whether the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore assesses whether the current taxi and ride hail operators are of the right market size and that there exists a robust competition between operators within the ride hail business and street hail business as well as between the two businesses.","Mr Chan Chun Sing: The Land Transport Authority's (LTA) regulatory framework for the point-to-point (P2P) transport sector will take effect from June 2020. The framework contains provisions to keep the market open to new providers of P2P services. For example, licensed operators will not be allowed to offer exclusive arrangements to ""lock in"" drivers that in effect prevent them from driving for other operators.The new P2P framework does not restrict the ability of the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) to monitor for anti-competitive behaviour in the P2P sector, and initiate investigations where it has reasonable grounds to suspect that the Competition Act prohibitions have been infringed. We will also work with LTA to ensure businesses compete on a level playing field and that consumers' interests are protected."
average savings in electricity bills for households that switched to open electricity market,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what are the average savings in electricity bills for households that have switched to the Open Electricity Market; and (b) whether the Ministry has observed an increase in average household electricity consumption arising from the cost savings.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: Households that have switched to a retailer in the Open Electricity Market (OEM) have enjoyed between 20% to 30% savings compared to the regulated tariff.Given that the OEM rollout was only completed recently in May 2019, it is too early to determine whether the cost savings have resulted in any changes to households' electricity consumption patterns. The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) and Energy Market Authority (EMA) intend to conduct a study on this at an appropriate time. "
steps taken to secure and invest in singapore's long term food security,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources what steps are being taken towards securing and investing in Singapore's long-term food security even as the world faces climate change and urbanisation.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Food security is a national security issue that is closely linked to human life and health. Given that we import over 90% of our food, Singapore is vulnerable to volatilities in the global food market and disruptions in our food supplies. This vulnerability will become more acute in time, as global crop yields are estimated to decline by up to 25 percent by 2050 due to climate change impacts. With such challenges in mind, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) was formed in April 2019 with the mission to strengthen and ensure Singapore’s food security. SFA does so by pursuing three broad strategies, which we call our three ""food baskets"" – ""Diversify Import Sources""; ""Grow Local"" and ""Grow Overseas"". For our first food basket, SFA works with stakeholders such as food importers to diversify our food import sources. This ensures that we are not overly reliant on a particular country, and reduces the impact of a disruption in food supply from any one source country. To support this, SFA is accrediting more farms across different countries and geographical regions for food safety to enable them to export to Singapore, and brings importers on food sourcing trips to facilitate import tie-ups. SFA has also introduced requirements for importers of key food items, such as eggs, to adopt plans to mitigate the impact of any supply disruptions. Our second food basket, ""Grow Local"", will help Singapore reduce our reliance on imports and buffer the impact of overseas supply disruptions. At the Committee of Supply debate earlier this year, I announced that my Ministry has set out to achieve ""30 by 30"", to develop the capability and capacity to locally produce 30% of Singapore's nutritional needs by 2030. This is a significant jump from our current local production of less than 10%. As SFA works with our agri-food industry to adopt new solutions to raise productivity, these solutions need to also adopt circular economy approaches, to overcome our resource constraints, such as for water and energy. This way, Singapore also becomes more climate resilient. SFA is committed to partnering our food producers in this journey. New farm plots have been tendered out to those with the best concepts instead of the highest bid prices. Through the Agriculture Productivity Fund (APF), SFA supports farmers in their efforts to modernise and harness innovative, sustainable technologies and advanced farming systems. For example, APF supported Singapore Aquaculture Technologies, an existing coastal fish farm, to adopt a closed-containment aquaculture system. In a closed-containment system, the water to culture the fish is separated from the sea water, enabling fish production to be resilient to fluctuations in external environmental conditions. Furthermore, as announced in March this year, funding of up to $144 million will be allocated from within the Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2020 (RIE2020) Plan to the Singapore Food Story Research & Development Programme. The programme was jointly developed by SFA and A*STAR to grow a vibrant and forward-looking agri-tech and food ecosystem, with one of the focus areas being sustainable urban food production. Under this, SFA partners the research community to find solutions for the gaps that current technologies cannot solve. Potential research areas include the use of smart sensors in climate-resilient farming systems in tropical aquaculture and urban agriculture. This exciting vision will require us to continue to innovate. One area that is gaining interest is urban farming in alternative spaces such as vacant multi-storey carparks. This involves innovative use of spaces in the urban environment to farm, brings local produce closer to the community, reduces carbon footprint and raises awareness on the importance of food security by involving the community directly in food production.  For our third food basket, SFA works with ESG to support our companies to expand and grow overseas. These overseas-based Singapore companies will be able to overcome land and manpower constraints, and access new and bigger overseas markets. This will allow them to bring down costs through economies of scale, and reduce the price of exports to Singapore.SFA will continue to work with agencies, industry and the community to strengthen Singapore's food security. "
singapore as thought-and-industry leader on solutions to tackle effects of climate change,"Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether Singapore can be a thought-and-industry leader in how to tackle the effects of climate change, such as rising sea levels; and (b) if polders are a solution for Singapore, how can the spaces above the polders be used as work, live and play spaces.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Climate change brings new and existential threats to our country. We are already experiencing impacts such as warmer temperatures, more intense rainfall and prolonged dry spells. Sea-level rise, in particular, poses significant challenges to our city state. Just like how we have tackled our other existential challenges in the past, we are planning decades ahead to overcome the effects of climate change. Building on our ""water story"" of resilience and innovation, we will seek to turn constraint into strategic advantage for Singapore.We must first ensure that our adaptation planning is based on robust science. We have made an early start, with the setting up of the Centre for Climate Research Singapore (CCRS) in 2013 to build up knowledge and capabilities in climate science. CCRS is one of the few dedicated climate research centres in Asia Pacific focusing on research in tropical weather and climate. CCRS works closely with our neighbours to study in detail how climate change is affecting Southeast Asia and actively organises programmes to build regional capability in understanding climate science. To deepen our understanding of sea levels around Singapore, CCRS will be launching a $10 million National Sea Level Research Programme (NSLP) over the next five years. We will continue to develop CCRS to be a leading research centre in tropical weather and climate research in the region.  Sound climate science will guide us in developing robust solutions to tackle the effects of climate change. This includes learning from other countries and adapting relevant approaches and technologies to our needs. For example, learning from the Dutch, the Housing & Development Board (HDB) has embarked on Singapore's pilot polder project at Pulau Tekong, which when completed, will be used for military training. We are closely monitoring the implementation of this pilot. The lessons drawn will guide agencies on the feasibility and approach to implementing polders as a coastal protection option.  As a small island city state with limited resources, we face unique challenges but can turn these challenges into new opportunities and growth areas. We are working closely with industry and academic partners to develop innovative technologies and resource-efficient solutions that not only address our local challenges, but can also be applicable to other urban centres. Finally, even though we contribute only 0.11% of global emissions, we must continue to do our part. Singapore has adopted forward-looking domestic mitigation measures, including early actions such as implementing a carbon tax; improving industrial energy efficiency; increasing adoption of solar energy; growing our public transport network; and adopting a circular economy approach to resource management. But the Government cannot do this alone – everyone must play his or her part. Only then can we be a credible partner in contributing to and shaping global agreements on climate change; and importantly, our collective efforts will ensure that we pass on a liveable and sustainable Singapore to future generations."
effectiveness of jobs bank in getting employers to give fair consideration to local job applicants,"Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Manpower (a) in the last three years, how many employers hired locals instead of employment pass holders after advertising through the Jobs Bank; (b) how does the Ministry monitor the effectiveness of the Jobs Bank in terms of (i) helping Singaporeans make informed career choices (ii) pointing employers to suitable local talent; and (c) whether the Ministry has taken any further action against employers who advertise in the Jobs Bank without giving fair consideration to local job applicants.","Mrs Josephine Teo: To find suitable candidates, employers advertise job openings through a variety of channels, including print advertisements, online job portals and recruitment agencies. Likewise, jobseekers may apply to jobs advertised through multiple channels. It is therefore unlikely that an employer or jobseeker relies on any single portal, including MyCareersFuture.sg.MOM and Workforce Singapore's (WSG) efforts to help Singaporeans to find jobs also go beyond MyCareersFuture.sg. Under the Adapt & Grow (A&G) initiative, WSG and NTUC's Employment and Employability Institute (NTUC's e2i) offer a suite of career matching services including career coaching, employability workshops, job fairs and job matching through their career centres. Together with MyCareersFuture.sg, our career coaches help jobseekers to make informed career choices. There are also programmes that help jobseekers overcome mismatches in skills, wages or job expectations. For example, there are over a hundred Professional Conversion Programmes (PCPs) providing wage and training support for employers to re-train workers to take up new jobs or careers. The Career Support Programme (CSP) encourages employers to give opportunities to mature retrenched or long-term unemployed PMETs by providing wage support for a period of time.  Through A&G programmes and services, we helped about 30,000 Singaporean jobseekers find new jobs in 2018. In the first half of 2019, we helped about 18,000 jobseekers secure jobs, about 9% more than in the same period last year. MyCareersFuture.sg contributes to these placement results. Neither employers nor jobseekers are obliged to inform WSG of the outcomes of their job postings or searches. However, since it was launched in April 2018, its monthly visitorship has risen from about 214,000 in April 2018 to about 511,000 in June 2019. As a gauge of the portal’s attractiveness to employers, fewer than 20% of the job postings were to fulfil the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF)'s advertising requirement. This suggests that employers are coming on board MyCareersFuture.sg voluntarily because they find value in doing so.  Under the FCF, MOM takes action against employers with unfair hiring practices, including those that place job advertisements without fairly considering applicants. For instance, we have withdrawn work pass privileges from employers that pre-selected foreign applicants and went through the motions of advertising on the Jobs Bank without applying their evaluation criteria consistently across all candidates. We investigate cases where employers are suspected to have such practices and will not hesitate to sanction them."
review of employment pass criteria and applications in view of increasing citizen unemployment rate,"Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Manpower in light of the slowing growth of Singapore's economy this year and increasing citizen unemployment rate which stood at 3.3% as at June 2019, whether the Ministry will consider (i) tightening the Employment Pass (EP) criteria last reviewed in 2017 and (ii) reviewing EP applications by companies for permanent positions which are at the same time offered only on a fixed time contract basis to Singaporeans.","Mrs Josephine Teo: Based on preliminary data for the second quarter of 2019, total employment has continued to grow, although at a slower pace compared to the previous quarter and a year ago. At the same time, retrenchments have not picked up and remained fairly low at 2,300. Unemployment inched upwards but also remains low. This suggests that most employers are not laying off existing workers, but exercising greater caution in hiring. MOM and our tripartite partners are closely monitoring the economy and labour market, and stand ready to step up support for companies and workers through the Adapt and Grow (A&G) initiative. This includes employment facilitation services and Professional Conversion Programmes offered by Workforce Singapore (WSG) and NTUC's Employment and Employability Institute (e2i).Employment Pass (EP) holders typically renew their EP every two to three years, and all new and renewal applications are subject to the prevailing EP salary thresholds at that point. The EP criteria were last reviewed in 2017, with higher salary thresholds imposed, not just at entry level, but also for older EP holders. The increased salary thresholds reflect local salary progression, so that employers do not substitute local PMETs with cheaper EP holders, and that EP holders are of the right calibre to complement our local workforce. We will continue to monitor wage levels of local PMETs, and will revise the EP salary thresholds if necessary. The scenario that the Member outlined, where for the same job, an EP holder is offered a permanent position, but a local offered a fixed term contract, would appear to be a breach of the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices (TGFEP). So far, MOM and the Tripartite Alliance for Fair & Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) have not received reports of this nature. We urge members of the public who are aware of such cases to report them. "
review retirement and re-employment act to include care-givers,Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Manpower whether there are plans to amend the Retirement and Re-employment Act to include those who have been out of the labour force for care-giving reasons but who may wish to rejoin the labour force after their care recipient passes on.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: Under the Retirement and Re-employment Act (RRA), it is an offence for employers to dismiss workers on grounds of age before the minimum statutory Retirement Age of 62. Additionally, employers are required to offer re-employment contracts to eligible employees from 62 up to the Re-employment Age of 67. The RRA covers persons who rejoin the workforce if they meet the same criteria as those who remained in the workforce. The priority should therefore be to help them return to employment. They are likely to need some training or reskilling. Through Adapt and Grow, they can access a suite of services and programmes to facilitate employment matching and overcome mismatches in skills or wages."
companies that voluntarily restored cpf contribution rates for employees aged 55 years and above,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Manpower to date, how many companies have voluntarily restored the CPF contribution rates for employees aged 55 years and above and how many employees have benefitted.","Mrs Josephine Teo: Today, employers can make voluntary CPF contributions on top of mandatory CPF contributions for all their employees. The three ways are through the Additional MediSave Contribution Scheme, Retirement Sum Topping Up Scheme and Voluntary Contribution to all three CPF Accounts Scheme. In 2018, about 1,000 employers made voluntary contributions for about 13,000 employees aged 55 and above. However, as these are private arrangements between the employers and their employees, CPF Board does not have sight over the basis for voluntary contributions and if they are due to voluntary equalisation of CPF contribution rates for employees aged 55 and above."
update on training accident death of corporal first class liu kai,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Defence in respect of the training accident death of Corporal First Class Liu Kai (a) whether the Ministry or the AGC has found that any persons should be held responsible for their conduct during the training; and (b) if so, whether any decision has been taken to institute any disciplinary or legal proceedings or criminal prosecution.","Dr Ng Eng Hen: As the Police investigations into the death of Corporal First Class Liu Kai have not been concluded, MINDEF is unable to provide a reply to the Member's specific queries."
violence against persons of minority sexual orientations or gender identities,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what is the Ministry doing to reach out to persons of minority sexual orientations or gender identities who are facing physical, psychological or sexual violence from family members or intimate partners; (b) whether state-run institutions are trained to be sensitive to their needs and particular experiences when they report incidents of domestic violence; and (c) whether there are plans to launch awareness-raising campaigns and programmes to work with NGOs to support LGBTQ victim-survivors and reach out to those suffering in silence.","Mr Desmond Lee: We do not and should not tolerate violence against any person, regardless of gender or sexual orientation. The Penal Code criminalises violence and the use of force against all persons, including LGBTQ persons. The Protection from Harassment Act, or POHA, enables victims of harassment to apply for protection orders against their perpetrators. The recent Criminal Law Reform Act has strengthened protection in both the Penal Code and POHA, by enhancing penalties for offences against vulnerable persons and victims of violence in intimate or close relationships with the perpetrator. The recent POHA amendments have also strengthened the protection framework for intimate partners under POHA.Our institutions and social workers are trained to be sensitive to the diverse needs of victims of violence, including those of LGBTQ persons. Victims of violence may approach our Social Service Agencies, such as Family Violence Specialist Centres and Family Service Centres, for assistance. These services are provided to anyone in need, without discrimination. No victim of violence should have to suffer in silence. MSF has run public education initiatives to raise awareness. Our Break The Silence campaign, in particular, focuses on the role of bystanders in preventing and reporting acts of violence – regardless of marital status or sexual orientation of the victim. Everyone has a part to play to prevent, detect and report all forms of violence. "
trends of persons of minority sexual orientations or gender identities seeking mental healthcare,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Health (a) what are the figures and trends of persons of minority sexual orientations or gender identities who are seeking mental healthcare; and (b) whether there are plans to provide resources to targeted counselling and social services, as well as LGBTQ-sensitivity training to service providers, to address their specific mental health and psychological well-being needs.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: MOH does not keep track of the number of people with minority sexual orientations or gender identities seeking mental health care.  Public mental health services are available to all Singaporeans irrespective of gender identity. Over the years, MOH has worked with partner agencies, healthcare institutions and community service providers to develop and expand mental health services for persons who require care and support. In addition, the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) has set up the Gender Care Clinic in 2017, offering counselling and mental health support for persons experiencing emotional difficulties pertaining to gender identity. As the service is relatively new, it is premature to infer trends at this point in time.  Healthcare providers caring for persons with mental health conditions are trained to support these persons with empathy, sensitivity and due consideration of their specific care needs. "
export of singapore’s recyclable waste,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources how much of Singapore's recyclable waste is exported to overseas processors and which countries are the largest receivers of our recyclable waste.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Singapore recycles, on average, around 60% of our total waste generated. In 2018, about 30% of recyclable material, such as paper, plastics, glass and metal, was exported to countries including Australia, China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, South Korea, and Thailand for processing and recycling.  While the bulk of recyclables are already processed locally, my Ministry recognises the need for Singapore to continue building up our local recycling capabilities. This will allow us to better extract resources from waste and close the waste loop through adopting a circular economy approach. NEA is currently studying e-waste and plastics recycling solutions and technologies available in the market, and assessing their suitability for adoption in Singapore in terms of both environmental and economic sustainability. "
recourse for victims when pmd riders speed off after incident,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Transport (a) in accidents involving PMDs, what recourse do victims have if the rider speeds off before the victim is able to obtain a picture for submission to the MyTransport.SG app; and (b) whether physical barriers can be added to deter PMDs from high-traffic places where they are disallowed.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: I thank the Member for the question, which has been addressed by the Ministerial Statement on Personal Mobility Devices delivered on 5 August 2019."
findings from project to measure singapore’s carbon footprint,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether the five-year project launched in 2014 to measure Singapore's carbon footprint has been completed; (b) if completed, what are the findings of the project; (c) how much reduction in emissions will the carbon tax of $5 per ton of greenhouse gas emissions be expected to be achieved given that industry is projected to contribute 60.3% of our greenhouse gas emissions by 2020; and (d) what is the expected increased carbon footprint with the impending construction of Terminal 5.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: I believe that Nominated Member of Parliament Ms Anthea Ong is referring to the study undertaken by the National Parks Board to measure greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and removals from Singapore's Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry sector (LULUCF).As a party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Singapore reports our total GHG inventory across various sectors in our National Communications (NC) and Biennial Update Reports (BUR). In this regard, the National Parks Board undertook a study from 2013 to 2018 to set up a system to measure GHG emissions and removals from Singapore's LULUCF sector. Latest estimates for the reporting year 2014 indicate that the LULUCF sector accounts for about 0.1% of Singapore's net GHG emissions. Details were reported in Singapore’s third BUR last year. The study also found that our nature reserves, mangroves, and trees in urban areas served as key carbon sinks that offer significant GHG removals. The BUR is subject to stringent review by international experts under the UNFCCC’s International Consultation and Analysis process. Singapore has been commended for its robust, scientifically sound and comprehensive reporting standards of its LULUCF sector. Singapore has comprehensive measures to reduce our carbon emissions. The carbon tax of $5 per tonne of GHG emissions, which came into effect in January this year, is intended to send an economy-wide price signal to incentivise companies to reduce their emissions where it makes the most business sense. This tax will cover about 80% of our total GHG emissions and complements Singapore’s suite of mitigation measures to incentivise emissions reduction and transition to a low carbon economy. Given that this is the first year of implementation, we are monitoring the progress of the carbon tax. We are prepared to spend more than the estimated $1 billion that will be collected in carbon taxes over the next five years to help our industry and companies improve their carbon efficiency and reduce their emissions. We are also mindful of the need to reduce our carbon emissions from new developments. Changi Terminal 5 is still in the design stage and the carbon footprint has not yet been determined. Changi Airport Group and its consultants are exploring solutions to improve the terminal's energy efficiency."
reason for low take-up rate of business and institution of public character partnership scheme that recognise employee volunteering hours,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) what is the reason for the low take-up rate of the Business and Institution of a Public Character Partnership Scheme whereby employees of businesses can undertake volunteering hours; (b) what will be done to address the issues; and (c) whether the Ministry will review the scheme to include assets, such as the space used by charities and for charitable purposes, and other forms of corporate-giving to further encourage tripartite partnerships.","Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: We share Ms Ong's desire to see more companies take up the Business and Institution of a Public Character Partnership Scheme – or BIPS – which was introduced by the Government to encourage more employee volunteerism. BIPS offer businesses a 250% tax deduction on basic wages and related expenses incurred when their employees volunteer or provide services to Institutions of Public Character (IPC). To better understand their feedback, we organised a Focus Group Discussion (FGD) together with MOF and the National Volunteer & Philanthropy Centre (NVPC) last year with businesses and IPCs on BIPS. We found two main areas for improvement: firstly, awareness among both businesses and IPCs about BIPS; and secondly, the administrative ease of the scheme.We will do more to raise awareness of BIPS. NVPC will actively promote the scheme to businesses, such as through their corporate giving guide and Company of Good Fellowship programme. We will also share about BIPS with the IPCs through the Commissioner of Charities’ platforms and outreach events. We are working to refine the administrative processes for tax claims, both for businesses and IPCs. Today, businesses claim tax deduction based on the pro-rated wages of individual employees who had volunteered. We will provide an alternative for businesses who prefer to claim based on fixed man-hour rates. We expect this to take effect from the Year of Assessment 2020. Regarding Ms Anthea Ong's suggestion for BIPS to include assets, the scheme currently allows businesses to claim tax deductions for other qualifying expenditures, such as rental of spaces, if they are incurred as part of the volunteering activity. We can do much more to grow employee volunteerism, and will focus on improving the existing scheme and making its administrative processes more seamless and convenient for both businesses and IPCs. We thank Ms Ong for her suggestion for BIPS to include assets, and will also take it into consideration as we review our strategies to encourage corporate giving. "
prosecution for sale of illegal weight loss products,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Health (a) how many persons have been prosecuted in the past three years for the sale of illegal weight loss products; (b) whether there are plans to regulate the import and sale of weight loss products; and (c) what steps are taken by the Ministry to ensure that such products are safe for consumption.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) adopts a risk-based approach in the regulation of health products. Pharmaceutical medicines, which contain inherently potent medicinal ingredients and are used in disease treatments, are stringently evaluated by HSA before they can be approved for registration.  Supplements and traditional medicines do not require registration, but any addition of potent medicinal ingredients in such products are prohibited. HSA also carries out post-market surveillance, adverse reaction monitoring and routine sampling and testing on the safety of marketed health products.  When unsafe products are detected, HSA issues alerts to keep the public informed and takes action against the parties concerned. Dealers who import and supply products containing prohibited ingredients are liable to prosecution and if convicted, may be imprisoned for up to three years and/or fined up to $100,000.  In the past three years, HSA has prosecuted three persons for selling illegal weight loss products that contained undeclared medicinal ingredients. The illegal weight loss products are typically purchased by consumers over the Internet or overseas. HSA has thus been conducting public education on the dangers of buying products from unfamiliar sources, unknown websites or persons posting offers on online platforms. "
number of patients suffering from bedsores or pressure injury in community hospitals,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Health (a) in the past five years, whether the number of cases of patients suffering from bedsores or pressure injury have increased in community hospitals and nursing homes; and (b) whether the Ministry has an action plan to improve preventive care for bedsores.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: The number of severe pressure injuries in community hospitals has remained stable, at approximately three cases a year, in the last five years. MOH currently does not mandate reporting of pressure injuries in nursing homes, as they are assessed to be a lower risk setting. This is based on studies which have shown that the pressure injury risk and impact is higher and more severe in patients requiring higher levels of care. Nonetheless, based on discussions with nursing homes, MOH and the Agency for Integrated Care have not noted an increasing trend in pressure injuries. Our healthcare professionals monitor patients for pressure injuries, and implement preventive measures for at-risk patients, which include those who are malnourished or critically ill. Examples of such preventive measures are the use of air mattresses, and turning patients regularly.MOH and the Agency for Integrated Care have been encouraging cross-institutional sharing of learnings and quality improvement initiatives. MOH has also recently convened a Pressure Injury Workgroup comprising nursing wound experts across the care continuum, to explore and develop further preventive and management measures."
"removal of 3,000-tonne heap of scrap rubber materials left at sarimbun recycling park","Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what is being done to get the responsible parties to remove the 3,000-tonne heap of scrap rubber materials left at the Sarimbun Recycling Park; (b) whether the Ministry will issue an order for them to remove the materials; (c) how has the heap of materials affected park operations and the surrounding vegetation; and (d) whether such materials pose any health or environmental hazard.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The scrap rubber material is located within one of the plots at Sarimbun Recycling Park (SRP). As the public has no access to the plot and SRP is sited on an old landfill, these materials do not pose any health or environmental risks. There has also been no impact on the operations at surrounding plots in SRP, or on the vegetation surrounding SRP. The SRP plot where the scrap rubber material is located was leased to Morelastic Green Resources Pte Ltd. However, the tenancy was terminated in January 2019 as the company incurred substantial rental arrears. Under the tenancy agreement, it is the tenant's responsibility to remove the scrap rubber. Morelastic Green Resources Pte Ltd has started clearing the stockpile since 17 June 2019 and has removed most of the stockpile. NEA will then reinstate the land, including removal of any remaining stockpile, and recover the associated costs from the company. NEA will also investigate and take firm enforcement action against any environmental public health offences committed. "
effectiveness of employment assistance schemes targeted at various age groups,"Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Manpower (a) in the last two years, what has been the average and median length of time for workers in the different age groups to secure employment; and (b) whether the various employment assistance schemes provided to help workers in these different age groups to secure employment have been effective.","Mrs Josephine Teo: The median duration of unemployment among all residents aged 15 years and over was eight weeks in 2017 and 2018.  In general, the median duration of unemployment rises with age, from about five weeks in 2018 for those aged 15 to 24 years, to 13 weeks in 2018 for those aged 50 years and above. The detailed breakdown of these figures is available in MOM's Report on Labour Force in Singapore, published in January each year and available on MOM's website.Through the Adapt and Grow (A&G) initiative, Workforce Singapore (WSG) and NTUC's Employment and Employability Institute (e2i) offer employment facilitation services such as career coaching, employability workshops, job fairs and job matching. They also provide a suite of employment support programmes to help jobseekers take up new jobs and careers. In 2018, about 30,000 jobseekers found jobs through the A&G initiative, an increase of about 20% compared to 2017. Of these, close to 16,000 were aged 40 and above, with nearly 9,000 aged 50 and above.To support mature and older jobseekers in their efforts to secure good employment, the A&G initiative offers enhanced rates of training or wage support to employers that hire jobseekers aged 40 and above. For instance, the Professional Conversion Programmes (PCPs) help workers to reskill for new career opportunities as economic transformation continues apace. PCPs provide training and salary support to help jobseekers reskill and move into new occupations or sectors, with higher support for those aged 40 and above. Another A&G programme is the Career Support Programme (CSP), which provides salary support to encourage employers to hire mature retrenched PMETs. The Member asked if our employment assistance schemes have been effective. Overall, the Adapt and Grow initiative has produced encouraging results. In 2018, close to 5,000 individuals (including mature and older jobseekers) were placed through PCPs. Most PCP participants did well, with about nine in 10 remaining employed 18 months after being placed, and about two-thirds receiving higher wages than before due to the skills they had acquired. As for CSP, over 1,200 individuals were placed in 2018. About seven in 10 CSP participants remained in employment 18 months after being placed. While we are heartened by the good progress of A&G, we are also working to do better in three areas. First, we will strengthen A&G's outreach so as to raise awareness of the support available to jobseekers. Second, we will continue to monitor the outcomes of existing programmes, and review or enhance them as necessary to improve their effectiveness. Third, we are moving upstream to help at-risk workers to stay relevant and re-skill for new roles. MOM and WSG will continue to monitor labour market outcomes for workers in each age group, and will work closely with our tripartite partners to help Singaporeans secure good jobs through the A&G initiative.

"checks in integrity of work permit, and employment and s pass systems",Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for Manpower with regard to the Report of the Auditor-General for FY2018/19 whether any forensic review has been done to ascertain the integrity of the Work Permit and Employment/S Pass systems for the period of 2 June 2011 to 31 December 2017 since there were no reviews conducted by the Ministry of activities performed by the IT vendor staff using the privileged operating system user account during that period as flagged by AGO.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: Following AGO's finding, MOM reviewed the operating system administrators’ activity logs from January 2018 (earliest available). We found no unauthorised activity. Given the heightened cybersecurity risks, we acknowledge the value of more regular reviews and now conduct them on a monthly basis.Although the same type of review was not conducted between June 2011 and December 2017, MOM has in place various measures to mitigate the risk of unauthorised activity undermining system integrity.Since the commissioning of the Work Permit System and the Employment Pass System in 2004 and 2008 respectively, all personnel, including IT vendor staff, have been segregated into applications and system administrator roles, with separate access rights for different part of the systems. This reduces the risk of a malicious breach of system security or data integrity as no individual has sufficient access to the system to manipulate it without being discovered. There are also regular reports and automated checks to ensure that applications are functioning as intended.Since 2011, the Ministry has also recorded the sessions of all administrators. The primary purpose of the session recordings is to support investigations if a system anomaly is detected, or malicious activity is suspected. Given the volume of data amassed from the recordings, MOM takes a risk-based approach and reviewed sessions of higher risk activities. No unauthorised activity has been detected thus far. A forensic review is an in-depth investigation triggered by a suspected malicious activity or security incident, in order to uncover details about the specific incident. As no unauthorised activity was detected, there was no basis to order a forensic review.  "
extension of co-funding for assisted reproductive technologies treatments,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the Ministry is aware of the number of couples seeking assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) treatment overseas and their reasons for doing so; (b) whether co-funding for ARTs treatment can be extended beyond public hospitals to private hospitals and clinics; (c) what are the reasons for the decreasing ART co-funding with each attempt; and (d) what is the process for women of age 45 and above appealing for in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) and the average time taken for an approval.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: There are three public healthcare assisted reproduction (AR) centres – National University Hospital, Singapore General Hospital and KK Women's and Children's Hospital. Today, Singaporean couples who undergo assistive reproductive technologies (ART) treatments at these centres can receive co-funding of up to $7,700 per fresh cycle and $2,200 per frozen cycle, for three fresh cycles and three frozen cycles. A frozen cycle costs less than a fresh cycle because a fresh cycle requires the whole ART process like egg stimulation, egg retrieval and fertilisation. While the co-funding for each fresh cycle and frozen cycle differs, the amount of co-funding does not decrease with each successive ART attempt.We have sufficient capacity at the public healthcare AR centres for co-funded ART treatments. Couples can commence their ART treatments when they have completed their necessary applications, counselling and tests and assessed to be medically ready. Patients who prefer to seek treatment at private hospitals can use MediSave to help offset the costs, up to the prevailing withdrawal limits. The Ministry does not have information on the number of couples seeking ART treatment overseas.The current age limit for ART treatment in Singapore, including in-vitro fertilisation (IVF), is set at 45. Women aged 45 years and above who wish to undergo ART treatment may appeal to the Ministry of Health, through their ART practitioner. In assessing the appeal, MOH may seek advice from its panel of experts where necessary. The average time for processing an appeal is currently about a week.As advancements in ART have improved the safety of ART procedures, the Ministry is reviewing the maximum age limit for women to undergo ART treatment in Singapore.           "
action against perpetrators who spread fake news on social media that cause racial disharmony,Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether any action will be taken against perpetrators of fake news on social media which is intended to cause racial disharmony.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The Government has always taken very firm action against individuals or groups who create racial disharmony.Under the Penal Code, it is an offence to commit acts that deliberately wound the racial feelings of any person, promote enmity between different racial groups, or conduct acts that are prejudicial to the maintenance of racial harmony. For example, in January this year, we charged a Chinese man under the Penal Code for deliberate intent to wound the racial feelings of the Malay population. The man had scrawled racist messages about Malays on walls in void decks and sheltered walkways in Geylang and Aljunied. This is not the only example. I will circulate to Members a list of cases involving racial and religious insult that occurred in the past five years.Where a person communicates a falsehood that is likely to incite feelings of enmity, hatred or ill-will between different groups of persons, he may be prosecuted.I will give an example. A few weeks ago a number of persons made postings falsely alleging racial discrimination in security checks of public transport commuters. They are being investigated. Likewise, investigations are ongoing against persons relating to the rap video which attacks Chinese. "
numbers in merdeka generation who require permanent help with at least three activities of daily living,Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked the Minister for Health (a) how many Merdeka Generation Singaporeans require permanent help with at least three of six Activities of Daily Living; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider a disability assistance scheme for the Merdeka Generation that is similar to that for Pioneer Generation Singaporeans.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: We estimate that there are currently about 9,000 Merdeka Generation seniors who require permanent help with at least three out of six Activities of Daily Living.  MOH is rolling out CareShield Life, which is a long-term care insurance that provides peace of mind and protection against uncertainty of disability care in old age. CareShield Life will provide life time payouts in the event of severe disability.The majority of Merdeka Generation seniors are still healthy and able-bodied today, and will be able to join CareShield Life from 2021. To encourage them to join CareShield Life, the Government will provide a $4,000 sign-on incentive under the Merdeka Generation Package. Lower to middle income policy holders will also be eligible for subsidies that help keep premiums affordable. Those who still face difficulty paying their premiums can apply for additional premium support.  For those who already require permanent help with at least three out of six Activities of Daily Living, and are hence ineligible to join CareShield Life, they can apply for financial help through the new government-funded ElderFund which will be introduced by MOH in 2020.In addition to CareShield Life and ElderFund, MOH will also roll out a new Home Caregiving Grant later this year and MediSave withdrawals for long-term care next year. Together with subsidies of up to 80% for long-term care services, all these initiatives will make long-term care more affordable for Merdeka Generation seniors.                              "
effectiveness of save-a-life initiative,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Home Affairs how effective has the Save-A-Life (SAL) initiative been in saving lives.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) launched the Save-A-Life (SAL) initiative in August 2015. The initiative aims to increase the survival rate of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) victims by building a network of community first responders who are trained in performing CPR and in the operation of AEDs, to respond to cardiac arrest cases in their immediate vicinity. Since the launch of SAL, more than 4,800 AEDs have been installed at the lift lobbies of HDB blocks. More than 200,000 people have been trained to perform CPR and to operate AEDs. The SAL initiative has seen encouraging results. The bystander CPR rate, which is defined as the percentage of OHCA incidents where a bystander had performed CPR, increased from 50.7% in 2014 to 56.4% in 2016. The bystander AED usage rate has also increased, from 3.6% to 4.6% over the same period. These have contributed to the improvement in the OHCA survival rate from 4.1% in 2014 to 6.5% in 2016. (We are working with MOH to get more recent data.) In addition, the number of community first responders who responded to cardiac arrest cases via SCDF's myResponder mobile app increased from 214 in 2015 to 820 in 2017.  The SCDF will continue to work with the Ministry of Health and the Singapore Heart Foundation to encourage more public and private establishments to install AEDs. Members of the public who are trained in CPR and AED skills are also encouraged to download the SCDF myResponder mobile app and register themselves as community first responders.              "
inflation adjustments for payouts under silver support scheme,"Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for Manpower whether the quantum of support provided under the Silver Support Scheme will be reviewed to cater for (i) inflation since its launch in 2014 and (ii) the findings of a recent NUS study which concluded that Singapore seniors each need at least $1,379 monthly to meet basic needs.","Mrs Josephine Teo: The Silver Support Scheme was introduced as a complement to Workfare, to mitigate the effects of income inequality. It supplements the retirement income of elderly who had low incomes through life, and now have little or no family support. Eligible elderly receive cash supplements of up to $3,000 a year. More than 180,000 elderly have received a total of about $1.3 billion in Silver Support payouts since it was implemented in 2016.The Ministry of Manpower is reviewing the Silver Support Scheme and will take into account factors such as inflation.As we have explained previously in this House, Singaporeans meet their retirement needs through a combination of income sources, including their CPF savings, private savings, as well as support from family. The Government also provides a range of support, including through the Pioneer and Merdeka Generation Packages, and GST Vouchers and U-Save rebates. For each of the schemes including Silver Support, the quantum of support is designed to be meaningful for their purpose and fiscally sustainable. We consider findings from a variety of sources where relevant.                     "
number of recipients of scholarships under community care manpower development award,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Health how many students, mid-career switchers, community care sector staff and general practitioners respectively have received scholarships under the Community Care Manpower Development Award since its launch and whether the numbers have been hitting the targets.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Community Care Manpower Development Award (CCMDA) was launched in April 2017. It supports the community care sector in attracting new entrants, and developing in-service staff. A budget of about $12 million was set aside to support the programme up to 2020.To date, we have committed close to $8 million under the CCMDA to support around 250 individuals to pursue training and skills upgrading opportunities in fields such as nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and gerontology. Over 200 awardees are in-service staff, of whom about 10% are mid-career candidates. The other awardees comprise students and general practitioners.            "
installation of aeds in public parks,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for National Development whether NParks has plans to install automated external defibrillators (AEDs) in public parks.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: NParks has worked with SCDF to increase the number of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) in our parks and park connectors over the years. To date, 170 AEDs have been installed in our most frequented parks, including all nature reserves and regional parks, as well as park connectors with high visitorship. The AEDs are located at key locations in our parks, such as visitor centres, play areas, fitness corners and F&B outlets. This allows for a quicker response should a cardiac arrest emergency occur. Park visitors may find the AED nearest to their location via SCDF's myResponder mobile application.NParks is in the process of installing more AEDs across our parks, in consultation with SCDF.

action against perpetrators who spread fake news on social media that cause racial disharmony,Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether any action will be taken against perpetrators of fake news on social media which is intended to cause racial disharmony.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The Government has always taken very firm action against individuals or groups who create racial disharmony.Under the Penal Code, it is an offence to commit acts that deliberately wound the racial feelings of any person, promote enmity between different racial groups, or conduct acts that are prejudicial to the maintenance of racial harmony. For example, in January this year, we charged a Chinese man under the Penal Code for deliberate intent to wound the racial feelings of the Malay population. The man had scrawled racist messages about Malays on walls in void decks and sheltered walkways in Geylang and Aljunied. This is not the only example. I will circulate to Members a list of cases involving racial and religious insult that occurred in the past five years.Where a person communicates a falsehood that is likely to incite feelings of enmity, hatred or ill-will between different groups of persons, he may be prosecuted.I will give an example. A few weeks ago a number of persons made postings falsely alleging racial discrimination in security checks of public transport commuters. They are being investigated. Likewise, investigations are ongoing against persons relating to the rap video which attacks Chinese. "
further action against residents who refuse to take part in mediation to resolve neighbourly disputes,Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for National Development what further action does HDB take when complaints against neighbours persist especially against one particular resident and neighbours do not wish to participate in mediation or pursue the matter in the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunal.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Most disputes between neighbours can be resolved amicably with some help from grassroots leaders and community partners. The disputing parties can also seek formal mediation at the Community Mediation Centre to reach an amicable resolution. As a last resort in intractable cases where parties are unable to resolve their disputes by voluntary mediation or other informal means, the aggrieved party can file a case with the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunal (CDRT).  HDB will do its best to assist if the disputes involve any breach of common property rules, or if the disputes involve residents who are posing a danger to others. In such cases, HDB will raise the matter with the relevant government agencies, or with the Town Council to enforce the rules. In cases which involve hoarding behaviour, MND has also put in place an inter-agency taskforce, which includes HDB, to work with the community to minimise disamenities to neighbours.                               "
plans to reduce negative impact of climate change on older hdb flats,"Mr Chong Kee Hiong asked the Minister for National Development in light of the research collaborations which HDB has signed with material science company Evonik and technology company V-Key (a) whether any of the new applications will be adapted to benefit older flats; and (b) if it is not viable technically to do so for older flats, what plans does HDB have to reduce the negative impact of climate change on older flats or to expedite their replacements.","Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB's research collaborations with Evonik and V-key are still at an early stage. If the trials show that the technologies are viable, HDB will study how they can be incorporated into the design of new HDB blocks, and potentially retrofitted in existing HDB blocks as well. Technical feasibility and cost effectiveness will be key considerations.  In the meantime, HDB has implemented various measures to ensure a comfortable living environment in our towns and estates. Some examples include designing our HDB blocks to optimise natural ventilation, orienting HDB blocks to reduce heat gain, and providing more greenery in HDB estates. We will continue to study how to mitigate the negative impact of climate change on our flats."
training and accreditation for home defect inspectors,Mr Chong Kee Hiong asked the Minister for National Development (a) what are the measures to ensure that home defect inspectors are adequately trained and accredited; and (b) whether BCA will introduce a licensing framework for this profession.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: BCA encourages the construction industry to improve on workmanship quality through the Construction Quality Assessment System (CONQUAS) and Quality Mark (QM) schemes. CONQUAS assesses the structural works, architectural works, and mechanical and electrical works of a new building project. QM assesses the workmanship quality of the internal architectural finishes of every dwelling unit to ensure consistent workmanship quality.  Home buyers can use the CONQUAS and QM scores as a guide and benchmark for quality when they purchase a home. Beyond that, some home buyers also engage private sector firms to undertake home defect inspections. These home defect inspectors are not regulated or licensed by BCA. Our focus is to put in place tighter quality controls at the start of the building process. That is what the CONQUAS and QM schemes aim to achieve.                                  "
action against companies whose heavy vehicle drivers accumulate more than three speeding summons per year,Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether the Ministry will consider taking legal action against companies whose heavy vehicle drivers accumulate more than three speeding summons per year.,"Mr K Shanmugam: Under law, drivers are personally liable for violating traffic rules. This is understandably so. Third parties, including employers, could be liable in specific situations: for example, if the employer got the employee to drive while under suspension. In addition, there are obligations on companies that own heavy vehicles. Heavy vehicle owners are required to ensure that the vehicles are fitted with speed limiters that prevent them from exceeding the speed limit of 60km per hour. If the speed limiter is absent, not in good working order, or tampered with, the owners could be charged under the Road Traffic Act. First-time offenders are liable for an imprisonment term of up to three months or a fine of up to $1,000. "
proposal to review penalties imposed on convicted wildlife traffickers,"Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for National Development in light of the recent record seizures of illegal wildlife trade totalling S$66 million, whether there is a need to review the legislation and penalties imposed on convicted wildlife traffickers such that they are commensurate with the value of the illegal shipment.","Mr Lawrence Wong: In Singapore, the Endangered Species (Import and Export) Act, or ESA, governs trade in wildlife, to meet our obligations under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Under the ESA, wildlife traffickers could be fined up to $50,000 per specimen for the illegal import, export, or re-export of CITES-regulated species (up to a maximum fine of $500,000), and/or face imprisonment of up to two years.NParks will review these penalties as part of its continual efforts to ensure that our measures remain robust and effective."
take-up rate for sme transformation programmes,"Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry asked the Minister for Trade and Industry what has been the take-up rate for the SME transformation programmes including SMEs Go Digital, Productivity Solutions Grant, and Market Readiness Grant.","Mr Chan Chun Sing: The Government has implemented many programmes over the years to help SMEs upgrade their capabilities and grow their businesses. The SMEs Go Digital programme was launched in April 2017 to make it simpler for SMEs to adopt digital solutions. This includes providing step-by-step guidance on going digital through the Industry Digital Plans, pre-approving digital solutions with grant support, as well as offering consultancy and project management services. SMEs which are newly incorporated can take up foundational solutions with the Start Digital Pack. To-date, about 10,000 SMEs have benefitted from the programme. The Market Readiness Assistance (MRA) programme helps SMEs in taking their first steps to tap global markets. The MRA supports companies in activities such as preparing for market entry and participation in trade fairs. Since its introduction in 2013, about 5,000 companies have tapped on this programme to bring their business overseas. The Productivity Solutions Grant (PSG), introduced in April 2018, assists companies to adopt ready-made solutions like IT tools and equipment to become more efficient. The programme has been well received by businesses: around 6,400 projects have been supported so far, benefitting about 5,370 companies. There are many other grant schemes available to support SMEs, but I would like to emphasise that companies should not be grant-focused and scheme-centric. The grants and assistance schemes are meant to enable companies to build up their capabilities and become more competitive. This outcome can only be achieved when companies start by having a clear plan on how they want to transform and grow to meet the needs of their customers. As companies transform, they need to also invest in training their workers to help them pick up new skills and move up the value chain. The Government firmly believes that enterprise transformation must go hand-in-hand with worker training and skills upgrading. When we enhanced the PSG from 1 July 2019, we included a SkillsFuture Training Subsidy of up to $10,000 per company to encourage companies to embark on training when they undergo enterprise transformation.  "
number of qualified therapists for special needs children,"Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what is the respective number of qualified therapists in Singapore for occupational therapy, speech therapy and physiotherapy for special needs children; (b) what proportion of these therapists are working in Government-funded organisations versus private practice; and (c) what is the current student intake at the institutes of higher learning IHLs for such specialised courses.","Mr Desmond Lee: There are approximately 3,600 occupational therapists, physiotherapists and speech therapists registered with the Allied Health Professions Council (AHPC) as at December 2018. Slightly more than half of these therapists practice in the public healthcare sector, and about 20% work in private practice. In either of these contexts, the therapists may work with children with special needs.  Another 15% of AHPC-registered therapists are employed in MSF- and NCSS-funded Social Service Agencies (SSAs). These 230 occupational therapists, 150 physiotherapists, and 140 speech therapists serve a number of social service programmes, including Early Intervention programmes for children with special needs, and Special Education schools.With the ramp-up in programmes serving children with special needs, MSF has funded three Therapy Hubs since 2015. These Therapy Hubs are run by SSAs. They train and deploy therapists to MSF- and NCSS-funded social service programmes, including those run by other SSAs which may not have sufficient scale to hire and retain their own therapists. The three Therapy Hubs have expanded their capacity significantly in the past four years, growing from approximately 170 therapists in 2015 to 260 therapists in 2018. More than half of these Hub therapists, or over 150 therapists, support paediatric intervention in multiple settings, including Early Intervention centres, Development Support provided in preschools, and Special Education schools. We will continue to support the Therapy Hubs and other SSAs so that they, in turn, can do their best to support children with special needs.On the current student intake, the occupational therapy and physiotherapy Bachelors' courses are run by the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT), while the speech therapy graduate-entry Masters’ course is run by the National University of Singapore (NUS). The average total annual intake of these courses from 2016 to 2018 was around 220. MSF and MOH will continue to work with the Institutes of Higher Learning to ensure that cohort sizes are commensurate with the demand for therapists from both the health and social service sectors, and that the content of the courses meets the needs of both sectors."
"singapore's average daily intake amounts of oil, sugar and salt","Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked the Minister for Health (a) over the last five years, what have been the average daily oil, sugar and salt intakes per capita; and (b) whether the Ministry has set targets for Singaporeans' oil, sugar and salt consumption over a particular timeline.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Health Promotion Board (HPB)'s National Nutrition Survey tracks fat rather than oil consumption. In the 2018 survey, total fat consumption per person was 98 grams compared to 91 grams in the 2010 survey. Saturated fat, which is unhealthy, has decreased from 38% to 36% of total fat consumed while daily trans-fat intake halved from 2.1 grams to 1.0 grams over the same period. The World Health Organization's (WHO) recommendation is that no more than one-third of dietary fat should come from saturated fat, and to eliminate all artificial sources of trans-fat from the food supply.  Average daily sugar intake per person increased slightly from 59 grams in 2010 to 60 grams in 2018. This is in excess of the WHO recommended upper limit of 50 grams (or 10 teaspoons) per day. Pre-packaged drinks remain the largest single contributor of sugar in our diet. The average salt intake amongst Singaporeans was nine grams in 2018, compared to 8.3 grams in 20101. While the methodologies to estimate salt intake in 2018 and 2010 were different, both figures clearly show that Singaporean's average salt intake exceed the WHO recommended intake of five grams per day. The majority of our salt intake comes from sauces, seasoning, and salt added during food preparation.  Much remains to be done to reach WHO's recommended targets. MOH and HPB will continue to promote healthier diet and increase the availability and accessibility of healthier choices. Citizens too can play their part through healthier food and lifestyle choices.                      "
impact of tension in straits of hormuz on singapore's oil trade and electricity tariffs,Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked the Minister for Trade and Industry in view of the tension building up in the Straits of Hormuz (a) how will any escalation of the situation impact on Singapore's oil trade; and (b) what are the plans to stave off any sudden spike in electricity tariffs caused to households by the resultant rise in oil prices.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: The Straits of Hormuz is a vital oil transit passageway. More than 20% of global petroleum consumed passes through the straits. While the International Energy Agency (IEA) has announced that emergency oil stocks are sufficient to cover supply disruptions for an extended period, tensions in the straits can put upward pressure on oil prices.Oil trading volume has remained steady so far. However, as Singapore imports almost all our energy needs, our electricity prices cannot be insulated from movements in the global energy market. Within Singapore, we promote competition in our energy market so that Singaporeans can enjoy competitive electricity prices. The Open Electricity Market (OEM) is one such initiative. Since May this year, all households and small businesses have the option to buy electricity from a retailer of their choice under the OEM. Consumer feedback has been positive so far, with thirteen electricity retailers offering a good range of competitively priced plans and households reporting savings of about 20-30%.We do not subsidise electricity prices upfront, as this may encourage over-consumption and disproportionately benefit wealthier households who tend to consume more. To help lower- and middle-income HDB households cope with their utilities expenses, we provide the GST Voucher – U-Save, which gives quarterly rebates on utilities bills."
smoking-related complaints,"Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what is the total number of smoking related complaints received in each of the past two years; (b) of these, how many were caught smoking in prohibited areas; and (c) how effective have thermal cameras been in enforcing smoking restrictions in prohibited areas.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M:  The National Environment Agency (NEA) received about 19,000 and 25,000 instances of feedback related to smoking in 2017 and 2018 respectively. In 2018, more than 30,000 tickets were issued by NEA for smoking in prohibited places, up from more than 22,000 tickets in 2017.NEA has made about 90 thermal camera deployments in residential areas with persistent feedback on smoking issues since January 2019. The thermal cameras complement NEA's surveillance in smoking-prohibited places to detect unlawful smoking at common corridors, lift lobbies or staircase landings. These thermal cameras are able to detect objects emitting high heat and capture images of the smoking offence. NEA uses the images captured by the thermal cameras along with other forms of evidence such as public feedback, for investigations. Thus far, about 70% of the deployments have captured smoking incidences, and NEA is investigating these cases. NEA will take enforcement action against smoking offenders whose identities have been established.  I urge smokers to be mindful of the health of others, and not light up in smoking-prohibited places. Families and friends of smokers, as well as the general public, can help reinforce the right social norms through reminders. Ultimately, we want to help smokers kick the habit for the benefit of their own health, their loved ones, and the community.                 "
number of children and foster parents in foster care scheme,Mr Chong Kee Hiong asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what is the number of children in foster care and the number of registered foster parents in the last three years; (b) whether the Ministry is on track to achieve its target of 500 foster families for 2019; and (c) what measures are planned to boost the number of successful fostering cases.,"Mr Desmond Lee: As at June 2019, we had 510 foster families, exceeding our target of 500 foster families. This is an increase of almost a third since June 2016, when there were around 390 foster families.  There were 542 children in foster care as of June 2019, compared to around 390 foster children in June 2016. This is an increase of around 40% over the past three years.About 47% of children in care are looked after by foster families today. Our goal is to place two-thirds of such children in family-based care. To do this, we are taking a multi-pronged approach.Firstly, MSF is working with Fostering Agencies, community organisations, religious groups and private organisations to raise awareness about fostering. We are also grateful that some of our foster parents readily step forward to share their experiences with interested families. Secondly, MSF will continue to provide close support to foster parents throughout their journey. For example, we provide preparatory training to prepare foster parents before children are placed with them. Case workers and other professionals also provide assistance and support to the foster parents during the period of care. We invite people who are keen to make a difference to the lives of vulnerable children through fostering to contact MSF to register their interest and find out more about foster care.            "
guidelines for wearing of headgear worn in celebration of racial harmony day in schools,"Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for Education with regard to the Ministry's recent guidelines on the wearing of headgear as part of ethnic clothes worn in celebration of Racial Harmony Day (a) whether the Ministry is aware of any public schools that do not allow the use of such headgear; (b) if yes, what types of headgear are not allowed to be worn; and (c) what are the reasons given by these schools for not following the Ministry's guidelines.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: Schools commemorate Racial Harmony Day annually, during which schools may have their students wear ethnic outfits. The practice in schools is that under those circumstances, students may wear the headgear if it complements their ethnic outfits. However, Racial Harmony Day commemoration is not a full-day school programme. Students need to be appropriately attired for other lessons, including Physical Education, laboratory or workshop classes where ethnic gear can have safety implications.  This year, there were some misunderstandings when those requirements were conveyed. The schools subsequently contacted the parents concerned, and clarified the matter.             "
review of criteria for building lifts at overhead bridges given ageing population,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry will consider reviewing its criteria for building lifts at selected overhead bridges especially with an ageing population that faces mobility challenges.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: LTA has installed lifts at 47 pedestrian overhead bridges over the last five years. This programme will be expanded to benefit the public through 50 more pedestrian overhead bridges by 2022.  Given the high project cost, as high as $4 million per pair of lifts, we must be prudent and have to prioritise our efforts. LTA will focus on locations which most benefit seniors and commuters with mobility challenges, such as public transport nodes and healthcare institutions.                                          "
measures to protect privacy of drivers with new satellite erp system,"Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry asked the Minister for Transport (a) what will be the measures to protect privacy of drivers when the new satellite ERP system is implemented; and (b) how will the Government store, process and analyse the data collected.",Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The design of the next-generation ERP system will incorporate appropriate security technologies and necessary controls to safeguard the privacy of drivers. This was a key requisite in the tender. The system anonymises and aggregates ERP data for traffic management and analysis. Collected data will not include driver identity. There will also be strict access controls to ensure that only authorised personnel are allowed to access the data.
objectives and significance of framework for co-operation across indo-pacific region endorsed at asean summit,Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether he can explain the objectives and significance of the framework for co-operation across the Indo-Pacific region that was endorsed on 23 June 2019 at the ASEAN Summit in Bangkok.,"Dr Vivian Balakrishnan: Southeast Asia is no stranger to big power dynamics and proxy wars. We experienced them during the Cold War. However, today the strategic environment is more complex. The international system is much more interdependent. ASEAN Member States have deep connections to all the major powers. We will need clear-eyed realism and acute situational awareness to navigate in the rapidly changing geopolitical landscape. As a group, ASEAN must maintain its strategic autonomy, and not allow Southeast Asia again to become an arena of great power rivalry. If ASEAN takes sides, or is forced to take sides, we will lose our independence of action, and end up making invidious choices which will be inimical to our interests in the long-run. It is thus important for ASEAN to maintain our relevance and to uphold ASEAN Centrality in the regional architecture. Not just geographically, but also effectively in the role that ASEAN plays maintaining a stable region and engaging the major powers, so that they can participate in and contribute to the region’s security and prosperity. The current inclusive regional architecture seeks to achieve this. We have continuously refreshed and enhanced the alphabet soup of overlapping ASEAN-centric forums, such as the ASEAN Plus Three, East Asia Summit, ASEAN Defence Ministers’ Meeting-Plus, and ASEAN Regional Forum. We should continue to look for ways to strengthen the current ASEAN-led regional architecture. ASEAN’s external partners have put forth various formulations to articulate their respective visions of what they now call the Indo-Pacific region. ASEAN should not merely adopt one or other of these proposals in order to win favour with its author. The ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific was born out of the desire to formulate a coherent and cohesive response to these formulations. The ASEAN Foreign Ministers had a candid discussion on the draft of the Outlook at our Working Dinner on 21 June 2019 in the lead up to the ASEAN Summit. The Outlook was adopted by the Leaders at the recent Summit. It will be a ""living document"", continually refined and updated to advance the existing, inclusive ASEAN-centric regional architecture as the strategic context evolves. It is underpinned by three principles: ASEAN Centrality and unity, economic development in the region, including through increasing connectivity, and upholding a rules-based order anchored on international law. All three principles are vital for Singapore’s own survival and prosperity as a small city-state.The Outlook will not stop strategic forces from pulling individual ASEAN Member States in different directions. ASEAN unity – the pre-requisite for ASEAN Centrality – will be tested. Our inherent diversity will make internal coherence difficult, but ultimately more necessary too. "
use of solar panels and solar power by households,Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) how many domestic households have currently installed solar panels for electricity production; (b) how much electricity is contributed to the national power grid by these domestic households; and (c) how much carbon emission has been reduced as a result.,"37 Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) whether the Minister can provide an update on the blockchain-enabled digital platform that allows households with registered solar photovoltaic panels to sell renewable energy to businesses; and (b) whether there are plans to extend this to the open energy market. Mr Chan Chun Sing: There are about 950 private residential solar photovoltaic (PV) installations, and more than 1,400 installations on HDB rooftops islandwide, that are connected to the power grid. Together, they make up more than 80% of the total number of solar installations in Singapore. These installations contribute about 0.16% of Singapore's electricity generation and reduce our carbon emissions by about 35 kilotonnes per year. This is equivalent to the emissions produced by the annual electricity consumption of almost 20,000 HDB 4-room households.  SP Group launched a blockchain-based platform called the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Marketplace in 2018. This REC Marketplace aims to enable the transaction of Renewable Energy Certificates, or ""green credits"", which are sold separately from the actual clean electricity generated. So far, various companies such as DBS and City Developments Limited have signed up to participate in the platform. We understand that the REC Marketplace is currently open to businesses only, but SP intends to extend the platform to residential consumers with solar PV panels at a later stage. The Government has also implemented various initiatives to encourage the deployment of solar installations by households. We have simplified the process to enable households to sell their surplus electricity to the grid through SP Group as an intermediary. Households may also enter into commercial arrangements to sell their excess solar electricity to retailers, who can then on-sell the solar electricity to other consumers in the Open Electricity Market. In addition, HDB has awarded three tenders totalling 166 Megawatt Peak (MWp) of solar generation capacity, and will be awarding a fourth tender of 70 MWp shortly. These panels will be installed on over 4,500 HDB blocks, as well as on the roofs of other government buildings. By 2020, HDB aims to have 5,500 HDB blocks fitted with, or identified for solar installation.  Solar power is our most viable clean energy option, given our land constraints, urban density, and geographic and climatic conditions, which pose challenges in tapping on other alternative energy sources such as hydro, wind and geothermal energy. Hence, the Government will actively continue to work with all stakeholders, including households, to maximise solar energy adoption in Singapore.   "
total hours of children programmes broadcast on free-to-air television channels,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Communications and Information for each of the last three years (a) how many total hours of programming aimed at young children are broadcast on free-to-air television channels in the typical week, broken down by the four official languages; (b) within this, what is the breakdown between educational and commercial entertainment programming; (c) what are some examples of educational programming; and (d) how is the provision and financing of such content aimed at children regulated or monitored.","Mr S Iswaran: Over the last three years, free-to-air channels broadcasted about 90 hours of children's programmes per week. Of these, six hours were in Chinese, 78 hours in English, three hours in Malay and four hours in Tamil. Over the same time period, an average of more than 70% of children’s programmes per week were educational in nature. Some examples of locally-produced educational programmes include:Junction Tree: Singapore's first bilingual series for preschoolers, which uses vocabulary-based learning strategies and original songs to make mother tongue learning fun for young children. The programme was produced in consultation with educators and language experts;Shahrukh & Warsan: An International Emmy-nominated history-themed Malay drama series about two children travelling back to the days of Singapore's founding fathers; andTrain Your Brain: A Mandarin, info-educational series that adopts an interactive approach and experiments to explore the way the brain works.Mediacorp has made children's free-to-air content accessible on Toggle. To better engage young viewers on this digital platform, Mediacorp has consolidated children's programmes across the four languages onto the Toggle Kids' page. Toggle offers a safe digital environment that parents can trust. Mediacorp has also improved the site such that children can navigate Toggle easily. Content on free-to-air TV channels are self-regulated by the broadcaster based on Codes issued by the Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA). The Content Code for Nationwide Managed Transmission Linear Television Services Code requires children's programmes on free-to-air channels to be wholesome and promote good social and moral values, and respect for law and order. For example, coarse language must not be used in children's programmes, and scenes depicting the consumption of liquor or tobacco products are also disallowed unless an educational point is being made.For children's programmes, sponsors are not permitted to incorporate their names into programme titles or segments, nor superimpose logos or signs into programmes."
sufficiency of number of nurses at public hospitals,"Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Health whether there is currently a shortage of nurses in the public hospitals and, if so, what are the hospitals doing to address the shortage and ensure that the well-being of our patients is not compromised.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Nurses form the largest professional group in our healthcare workforce. Our overall registered nurse to population ratio of around 7.5 nurses per 1,000 population in 2018, is comparable to that in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea. Seven out of 10 of our practising nurses work in the public healthcare sector. In tandem with our expansion in public healthcare capacity, the number of nurses working in the public healthcare sector has increased from around 21,700 in 2013 to 25,600 in 2018. To meet future demand for healthcare services in an aging population, we have expanded efforts to attract more Singaporeans to join nursing as well as to develop and retain serving nurses.  Some examples include (i) Raising the profile of nursing, such as through the Care to Go Beyond Campaign; (ii) Creating multiple pathways for mid-career professionals entering the profession, including professional conversion programmes; (iii) Raising the capacity and range of nursing training courses; (iv) Reviewing nurses’ remuneration to remain competitive; (v) And improving career recognition and progression.  To ensure that the nursing workforce is sustainable, we have also embarked on efforts to raise productivity. These include initiatives on automation, streamlining of nursing work, and shifting of care from hospitals into the community where appropriate. The Ministry of Health will continue to regularly review our nursing manpower needs, taking into consideration demographic and disease trends. We will also continue to work with educational and training institutions and healthcare providers to ensure that we have a nursing workforce that can serve the needs of Singaporeans."
review of eligible voting age for singaporeans,Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Prime Minister (a) if he will review the eligible voting age for Singaporeans under the Parliamentary Elections Act; (b) what is the consideration for retaining the current voting age; and (c) how many more voters will be eligible if the current voting age is changed to 18 years old.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing (for the Prime Minister): We have adopted a graduated approach in setting the various legal ages at which a person can undertake different responsibilities in Singapore. A person’s rights and responsibilities gradually increase as one matures, until the common law age of majority of 21, when a person comes of age to make decisions as an adult and engages in activities that involve significant personal responsibility.As has been explained in this House before, voting in elections involves making serious choices, which requires experience and maturity. Voters elect the President who exercises the custodial and veto powers under the Constitution. Voters also choose their Member of Parliament, and in so doing, decide on the group of individuals who will eventually form the Government. If we were to lower the voting age to 18 years old today, some 130,000 youths would become eligible to vote. The Government currently does not plan to lower the voting age. Nevertheless, we recognise that many youths want a voice in national matters and wish to make a difference. We will continue to keep such channels and platforms open for youths to express their views, and contribute to nation building. For instance, MCCY has launched the SG Youth Action Plan to give youths a platform to articulate their vision for the country, and propose policy ideas and partnership projects to achieve this vision.             "
strategic plan for mental health education for schools,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Education (a) what is the Ministry's strategic plan for mental health education and its de-stigmatisation; (b) whether the Ministry has considered re-framing physical health education to total health education that includes mental and emotional health; (c) whether feedback on the mental and emotional health of students are regularly collated and parents informed accordingly; (d) whether co-curricular programmes are recommended to schools to normalise mental health and improve help-seeking behaviours and, if so, what are these programmes; and (e) whether the Ministry will consider partnering external organisations to provide training and support to students' families.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: MOE adopts a holistic approach to supporting student well-being, covering physical health, social and emotional development and psychological support when necessary. We strengthen students' mental health through lessons on Character and Citizenship, Form Teacher Guidance Period and Physical Education. We build character in students through experiential learning platforms such as Co-Curricular Activities, Values-in-Action programme and outdoor education. Our schools teach students social and emotional competencies such as relationship management, stress management and help-seeking skills, which are then put into practice when students engage in various school activities. The curriculum was enhanced recently to raise greater awareness of common mental illnesses, normalise help-seeking behaviour, reduce stigmatisation, and promote peer support.Teachers monitor the well-being of students and work closely with parents and school counsellors to render additional support to those who need it. Schools also work with partners such as the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), mental health professionals and Family Service Centres to support students and their families within the community.

"parity in pensions and singapore allowance for employees in corporatised government agencies, government agencies and government departments","Mr Murali Pillai asked the Prime Minister in relation to persons who are receiving pensions from corporatised bodies of Government departments or statutory boards, whether the Government intends to procure these corporatised bodies' agreement to correspondingly increase the persons' pensions so that there will be parity between them and Government pensioners who will be receiving the Singapore Allowance and increases in the monthly pensions as announced in Budget 2019.","Mr Chan Chun Sing (for the Prime Minister): The pensions of Government pensioners who retired from the Civil Service are fixed based on their length of service and pensionable salary at the eve of their retirement. Government pensioners include pensionable officers who were transferred from the Civil Service to statutory boards and subsequently retired from the statutory boards.The Government has given an ex-gratia Singapore Allowance since 1974 to help Government pensioners whose monthly pensions are below a gross monthly pension ceiling. The current Singapore Allowance quantum is $320 and the gross monthly pension ceiling is $1,250.  Corporatised entities are private firms. Retirees who continue to receive retirement benefits from private firms will follow the terms set out by these firms, which do not need to be the same as those provided to Government pensioners.Retirees who receive retirement benefits from private firms may also be eligible for benefits, such as the Pioneer and Merdeka Generation Packages, that are given to all eligible Singaporeans. These benefits can help the elderly retirees cope with their expenses and would be paid out on top of any benefit their firms provide.     "
regulations for safe charging of powerful batteries at residences and workplaces,"Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Home Affairs given the prevalence of the use of more powerful batteries for phones, PMDs and other devices and the risk of accidental fires being caused by the overcharging of these batteries, whether the SCDF will consider issuing regulations for the safe charging of such batteries at residences and work places.","Mr K Shanmugam: Since 2016, there have been 230 fires involving electronic devices. 91% of these involved personal mobility devices (PMDs), power assisted bicycles (PABs) and personal mobility aids (PMAs). The remaining involved smaller devices, like power banks, mobile phones, laptops and tablets. Sixty-seven percent of the fires related to mobility devices occurred at HDB residential units. Six percent occurred at private residential units, and the remaining took place at non-residential premises, such as industrial and commercial buildings. Imposing regulations on how to charge batteries safely will be difficult given the widespread use of electronic devices, and the wide range of devices, which would make any such regulations difficult to craft and enforce. Consumers should be aware, however, that the charging of electronic devices carries some inherent risks. We strongly encourage consumers to exercise vigilance when purchasing and charging electronic devices. They should buy from reputable sources and adhere to the safety advice on the charging of the devices.  In particular, given the larger batteries in PMDs, PABs and PMAs, users should be especially careful when using and charging these devices. They should regularly inspect the batteries for signs of damage and corrosion, and avoid leaving the devices being charged unattended for an extended period of time. I urge all users to refer to SCDF's website for best practices. Also, PMD users should switch to UL2272 compliant devices as soon as possible, as they meet higher safety standards. For example, they prevent overcharging by cutting off the power supply to the batteries once they are fully charged. SCDF will further step up its efforts to educate users to adopt good fire safety habits, in partnership with LTA. "
impact of us-china trade tensions on singapore-owned companies operating in china or us,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what has been the impact of the current US-China trade tensions on Singapore-owned companies operating in either China or the US; and (b) what is likely to be the impact of these trade tensions on these companies' domestic operations.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: Our economic agencies have been engaging our companies closely. Generally, Singapore companies operating in the US or China have told us that they have not been significantly affected by the US-China tensions, either in their operations overseas or in Singapore. Their responses to the ongoing trade tensions have also been mixed – some companies are putting their investments on hold until there is greater clarity, while others are actively looking to diversify their businesses across different regions. In short, our companies are adopting a range of measures.The US-China trade tensions are not the only cause of the present slowdown. We are also experiencing the downswing in the global electronics cycle, which has affected externally-oriented sectors like wholesale trade and precision engineering. As I had shared with the House last month, the Government is closely monitoring the situation, and will provide support to the companies where needed.  Even as we weather our immediate challenges, we must maintain a steady course for the long-term. We must continue to transform our economy, by implementing the Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs), and investing in new capabilities such as digital and technology. We must also raise the productivity of our workers through SkillsFuture and continuous learning. By working together and investing for the future, we will emerge stronger from the present storm.                           "
new measures to reduce impact of loud traffic noises on residential housing situated near expressways,Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the agencies are looking at new measures to reduce the impact of loud traffic noises on residential housing situated very near the expressways; and (b) whether Ministry is looking at new technologies to reduce such traffic noises and improve the quality of living in such areas.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The Land Transport Authority (LTA) has completed trials on the effectiveness of noise barriers and low noise pavement mix. The trials showed that these measures could potentially reduce noise for residents living near expressways. LTA intends to roll out some of these measures progressively.When rolling out these measures, LTA has to consider multiple factors such as site-specific conditions and overall cost effectiveness. For example, noise barriers would not be suitable in locations where they may obstruct motorists' view.  In addition, LTA will continue to explore with other agencies new measures which can effectively mitigate the impact of traffic noise and improve the quality of living of our residents living near expressways.                  "
impact of protracted us-china trade war on job prospects for recent graduates,"Ms Tin Pei Ling asked the Minister for Manpower given the expected protracted US-China trade war, how will the job prospects for recent Singaporean graduates and youths be affected and what advice will the Government offer to Singaporean youths entering the workforce.","Mrs Josephine Teo: In May 2019, MTI narrowed its GDP growth forecast downwards for 2019 to 1.5% to 2.5%, taking into account a global growth outlook that remained clouded by uncertainties and downside risks, including ongoing trade conflicts between the US and China. Although the economy slowed, most indicators showed that the labour market held up in the first quarter of 2019. Specifically, for youths aged 20-29, their employment rate remained high at about 70%. While unemployment inched upwards to 5.6%, this falls within the range seen in the last five years. Nonetheless, we take concerns about jobs and the economy seriously. MOM and Workforce Singapore (WSG) are monitoring the labour market closely, and stand ready to step up our employment facilitation services and programmes under the Adapt & Grow (A&G) initiative, should the need arise. Young Singaporeans may also make use of available education and career guidance resources, including the MySkillsFuture portal, which provides tools and information on industries and occupations to support their career development. They may also tap on the MyCareersFuture portal to find jobs best suited to their skills. The recently-launched Career Starter Programme builds on the education and career guidance support and work experience that students graduating from the ITE and Polytechnics have had, by providing further employment support through workshops and personalised career guidance and coaching.  Young Singaporeans who require assistance finding jobs may approach WSG's Careers Connect or NTUC's Employment and Employability Institute (e2i)'s career centres, which offer career coaching, employability workshops, job fairs and job matching. As hiring may become more subdued, we encourage Singaporean youths entering the workforce to be open to opportunities in different sectors and occupations. They may also wish to consider work-study pathways such as the SkillsFuture Earn and Learn Programme to acquire industry-relevant skills and work experience related to their area of study. It is also useful to deepen existing skills or acquire new skills so as to be ready for opportunities when economic conditions improve.In short, be open, agile, relevant. There will be employers out there who will welcome you."
reviewing building maintenance and strata management act for part of monthly maintenance fee to be set aside for sinking fund in private estates,"Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for National Development (a) why does the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act not stipulate a minimum percentage, based on the monthly maintenance fee paid by subsidiary proprietors, to be set aside towards the sinking fund to meet cyclical maintenance needs of a private estate; and (b) whether the Ministry can consider amending the Act to help MCST management committees build sufficient sinking funds without having to go through the process of getting majority support through voting at annual general meetings.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Private condominiums, many of which are strata-titled, have different features and facilities, and their cyclical maintenance needs and costs may vary greatly. It is hence impractical to stipulate a minimum percentage of the monthly maintenance fees to be set aside for the sinking fund, which would be relevant to all strata-titled developments.  Instead, under the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act, or BMSMA in short, MCSTs have the flexibility to determine the amounts to be raised by contributions towards the sinking fund based on their development's specific needs. The BMSMA requires MCSTs to pass an ordinary resolution at a general meeting. This process allows the management council of the MCST to present the details of the proposed contribution rates, and gives subsidiary proprietors the opportunity to seek clarifications before making a collective decision."
extending 3-room hdb flats to applicants below age 55 with bigger families and less financial resources,"Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry asked the Minister for National Development whether HDB will consider allowing applicants who have not reached the age of 55 but have bigger families and in financially tight situations to purchase not just 2-room Flexi flats, but also new 3-room HDB flats.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Seniors aged 55 and above are allowed to buy new 2-room Flexi flats on shorter leases, to provide them with an additional option for right-sizing into a home to live out their retirement years. Buyers of these short-lease flats must choose a lease length that can cover them and their spouse up to the age of at least 95, so that they can enjoy a home for life. This is also the reason why shorter leases are not available to younger buyers, as such buyers are more likely to outlive the lease.  Buyers who prefer a larger 3-room flat on a shorter lease can buy one on the open market, where there is a wide range of resale flats with varying leases that can meet different budgets and needs. In addition, they can enjoy a Proximity Housing Grant of up to $30,000 if they purchase a flat to live with or near their parents or married children. "
follow-up by malaysia to protect information leaked on malaysian vehicle entry permit website,"Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Transport with regard to the security inadequacy discovered in the Malaysian Vehicle Entry Permit registration website in April 2019 where details of thousands of foreign motorists, including Singaporeans, have been exposed, what have been the follow-up measures taken up with our Malaysian counterparts to protect the sensitive information of Singaporean motorists.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Malaysia’s Vehicle Entry Permit (VEP) is intended for the installation of radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags to identify foreign vehicles entering Malaysia. This is different from Singapore's VEP, which aims to equalise the cost of owning and using a Malaysia-registered vehicle in Singapore with that of a Singapore-registered vehicle. Motorists can register for Malaysia's VEP through the Malaysian Road Transport Department's VEP website. On 26 April, it was reported that information of other motorists could be viewed by altering the site URL. This affected all registered motorists – Malaysians, Singaporeans and motorists of other nationalities were all affected. The website was taken down the same day and the issue rectified by the next day. The Malaysian Transport Ministry has stated that it treats data security with great urgency as it is of the utmost importance.            "
impact of huawei ban on singapore’s 5g deployment,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Communications and Information what impact will the US Huawei ban have on Singapore's 5G deployment.,"Mr S Iswaran: I have previously stated that our plan is to begin the roll out of 5G infrastructure next year. As of now, we expect to continue as planned with the deployment of 5G in Singapore.  Meanwhile, we are closely monitoring developments, consulting stakeholders, evaluating the technical aspects, and piloting use cases for 5G. IMDA has been seeking the industry’s views through a public consultation which concludes tomorrow. These initiatives and their findings will inform our decision and help us to work with the telcos and other stakeholders to commence the roll out of a resilient and secure 5G infrastructure in a timely manner.  "
statistics supporting how income criteria and benefits are determined for public assistance schemes,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) whether the Ministry will publish the research, evidence or statistics supporting how the income criteria and benefits are determined for the major public assistance schemes; and (b) whether the Ministry intends to undertake new studies that incorporate measurement of basic needs as benchmarks for such income criteria and benefits, in light of the recent Minimum Income Standards study published by the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy.","Mr Desmond Lee: Our public assistance schemes offer targeted assistance to meet different needs. ComCare, a key component of our social safety net, provides assistance to the low-income and vulnerable, to cover their basic living needs such as food, clothing, transportation, and communications. Low-income families are also supported by other schemes, such as the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme which supports the schooling expenses of children from lower-income families, the Public Rental Scheme which provides highly-subsidised rental housing, MediFund which provides assistance with medical expenses, and the Silver Support Scheme which supplements the retirement income of elderly who had low lifetime incomes and now have little family support. As each assistance scheme has different objectives and target groups and meet different needs, the eligibility criteria and benefits are based on different information sources and benchmarks. These are regularly reviewed by the Government.For instance, MSF regularly reviews the ComCare eligibility criteria and cash assistance rates. In our review, we look at expenditure data for daily living expenses of low-income families, as well as national statistical data collected by the Department of Statistics (DOS). Some of this data is published. We also consider input from community stakeholders, such as social workers and frontline officers who work with low-income families, as well as beneficiaries. Our ComCare cash assistance rates were recently raised with effect from 1 Jul 2019. The Long-Term Assistance cash assistance rates for a single-person household was increased from $500 to $600, and larger households will receive higher amounts. The Short-to-Medium-Term cash assistance rates have also been enhanced correspondingly. Importantly, in the design of schemes such as ComCare, agencies are given discretion to adjust the assistance given based on individual circumstances that low-income and vulnerable individuals and families are in.The Minimum Income Standards study published by the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy (LKYSPP), like other studies and reports, offers an additional data point for Government to consider on what an elderly person may regard as essential for his well-being. When considering such studies, however, we need to understand their strengths and limitations, whether design, methodology or conclusions, so that we draw the right learning points. For instance:The study was based on input from about 100 elderly persons, and is unlike typical quantitative approaches which aim for representativeness. The report also acknowledges that figures derived from the study may underestimate healthcare costs which are covered by various government subsidies such as the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS). In computing the minimum income that a senior needs for retirement, the study included a budget for housing in an HDB 2-room Flexi flat. However, since most seniors would have used sales proceeds from their larger flats to purchase the HDB 2-room Flexi flats, it would not be appropriate to include a housing budget in the estimates for most individuals. The estimates also include the cost of discretionary expenditure items such as overseas holidays and jewellery. Elderly individuals' desired quality of life may differ according to their circumstances, health status and lifestyle preferences. These textures may not be meaningfully expressed in a qualitative study. Every study has inherent limitations as assumptions must be made which do not always pan out in reality. However, studies like the recent one by LKYSPP are useful in raising awareness of the need of each individual to deliberately plan for the future, and to seed discussions on how we can help those who are in need. We hope that in raising awareness of these issues, we can work together as a society to support individual resilience, the strengthening of families, and support in the community, even as the Government continues to strengthen social support and the delivery of social services to help those in need.

"participation rate in flexi-work arrangements and impact on staff morale, productivity and turnover","Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the average participation rate in Flexi-Work Arrangements (FWAs) by employees at companies that have rolled out such arrangements; (b) how does the rate of Singaporeans participating in FWAs compare to those of other countries including OECD countries; and (c) whether there is a difference in productivity, staff morale and turnover for companies offering FWAs and those that do not.","Mrs Josephine Teo: Flexible Work Arrangements (FWAs) have become more common in Singapore. Based on a 2018 MOM survey1, about seven in 10 employees in Singapore now work in companies that offer at least one formal FWA, such as part-time work and flexi-time or staggered hours. In addition, about nine in 10 workers work in companies that allow their employees to take unplanned time-off to attend to personal matters, ad-hoc teleworking or both. Taken together, more than 9 in 10 employees work in companies that provide some form of work flexibility.This compares favourably to the experience of other OECD countries. From a 2016 OECD report2 covering 35 European countries, three in four employees have access to some work schedule flexibility, including taking one or two hours off for personal reasons. In another 2017 OECD report3, about 55% of female and 53% of male employees in the US had access to FWAs. FWAs benefit both employees and employers. For employees, FWAs allow them to better manage their obligations at work and their personal needs such as care-giving. For employers, studies4 have found that FWAs result in better employee engagement, reduced employee turnover and increased productivity. A 2018 MOM study5 also found that among workplace practices, availability of FWAs had the greatest impact on staff retention. Among employees who required FWAs in 2016, seven in 10 were provided with the arrangement that they needed6. While this is encouraging, there is room for workplace cultures to become even more progressive. This is why MOM launched the Tripartite Standard on FWAs, to recognise employers who actively facilitate FWAs. To date7, around 1,600 employers, with total staff strength of about 410,000, have adopted the Standard.The Government encourages and provides support to companies to implement FWAs. Employers may access the enhanced Work-Life Grant which has been raised to $100 million recently and make use of the new job-sharing implementation guide to offer FWAs to employees. "
discussion on rohingya issue at asean summit,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs (a) whether he can provide an update on the ASEAN Leaders' discussion on the Rohingya issue at the ASEAN Summit held from 19-22 June 2019, especially on their repatriation and guaranteed safety on their return; and (b) what have the ASEAN Leaders agreed to do in the meantime with regard to the education and well-being of the children in Bangladesh who, being stateless, are missing out on formal education given the continued delay of a resolution.","Dr Vivian Balakrishnan: During the recent Summit last month, the ASEAN Leaders and Foreign Ministers received an update on the findings of the Preliminary Needs Assessment that was conducted in Rakhine State from 4 to 13 March 2019. The assessment focussed on the readiness of the reception and transit centres, as well as potential relocation sites identified by the Myanmar government. ASEAN's potential assistance to the Myanmar government’s repatriation efforts include enhancing the capacity of the reception and transit centres, increasing awareness of the repatriation process, and supporting the provision of basic services in Rakhine State. ASEAN remains committed to assisting Myanmar in addressing this challenge. The safety and security of returnees, and indeed of all communities in Rakhine State, is of paramount importance. Repatriation should take place in a safe, voluntary, sustained and dignified manner. ASEAN will continue to support efforts by all stakeholders to create conducive ground conditions for repatriation to begin.The security situation in Rakhine State remains a concern. It has further deteriorated following the clashes since December 2018 between the Myanmar military (Tatmadaw) and the Arakan Army (AA). ASEAN has urged all Parties to avoid further outbreak of violence so that humanitarian assistance could reach those who are in need. The issue the member raised on education and wellbeing of the affected children in Cox's Bazar is an important one. Various stakeholders – the Bangladeshi government, the UN and other international donors, and some ASEAN Member States – have extended assistance to the displaced persons in Cox's Bazar. However, these are only temporary measures. So long as a permanent political solution remains elusive, the future of these children remain bleak.  That is why ASEAN has consistently stressed the need to find a comprehensive and durable solution to address the root causes of the conflict, and to create a conducive environment so that the affected communities can rebuild their lives. It is ultimately the responsibility of Myanmar to work towards a viable political solution that addresses the underlying causes of this longstanding and complex problem. This is the only way to resolve this problem once and for all.                   "
attempted suicide cases due to undesirable online influence,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) in the past five years, how many attempted cases of suicide have been due to undesirable online influence; (b) what measures has the Ministry taken to ensure that websites which share information on teaching how one can take one's own life or make explosives, guns or other life threatening devices are prevented from spreading in Singapore or made accessible to the public; and (c) whether existing legislation is adequate to tackle the proliferation of such undesirable online materials and their influence.","Mr K Shanmugam: We do not track suicide attempts by their cause, for example due to online influence. The causes are often complex and multi-faceted. The member also asked about the regulation of certain websites as a suicide prevention measure. Under the Broadcasting Act, the Info-Communications Media Development Authority (IMDA) has powers to direct Internet Content Providers to take down prohibited material, such as those which are objectionable on the grounds of public interest, public security, or national harmony. IMDA can also direct Internet Service Providers to block access to websites that contain such prohibited material. These standards are defined in the Internet Code of Practice. That said, because of the nature of the Internet, it is neither possible nor practicable to block or remove every website with objectionable or harmful content. Public education on the responsible and safe use of the Internet is the better approach. For example, our schools conduct cyber wellness lessons for students from Primary to Junior College levels. Students learn to be respectful and responsible users of social media and the Internet, and to identify and avoid inappropriate online content. Community organisations such as Fei Yue Community Services and Touch Community Services also promote cyber wellness for youths. The Media Literacy Council educates online users on how to deal with the undesirable effects of social media. Government agencies and stakeholders in the social sector also work together to prevent suicides upstream, including encouraging those at risk to seek help and supporting them.          "
response time of emergency ambulances during rush hour,Ms Irene Quay Siew Ching asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is the average response time and time taken by emergency ambulances to reach the nearest hospital during rush hours; (b) what is the percentage of emergency ambulances hitting targets for response time and time taken to reach the nearest hospital during rush hours; and (c) whether paramedics have raised concerns about vehicles not giving way to ambulances especially during rush hours.,"Mr K Shanmugam: During rush hours, the median response time for an emergency ambulance to arrive at the incident location is about seven minutes. The median time taken to travel from the incident location to the nearest hospital is about nine minutes. We use the median rather than the average response time as an indicator of performance, as the average response time will be skewed by outliers. SCDF's target is to be able to respond to 80% of all emergency medical calls within 11 minutes, regardless of the time of day. This is the time taken by the emergency ambulance to arrive at the incident location. In 2018, SCDF responded to 91% of emergency medical calls within 11 minutes. Like operators of emergency ambulance services in other countries, SCDF does not set a target for the time taken for the ambulance to reach the hospital. The ambulance crew, led by a paramedic, will provide the necessary care to the patients on the way to the hospital.Nonetheless, SCDF strives to reach the nearest hospital in the shortest time possible. Since 1 December 2017, SCDF ambulances are legally allowed to run red lights and make U-turns at non-designated junctions when responding to life-threatening emergencies, provided it is safe to do so. This was further extended to other SCDF emergency vehicles on 1 June 2019. In addition, SCDF is collaborating with the Land Transport Authority (LTA) to implement a traffic priority system in the vicinity of hospitals. The traffic priority system will provide right of way for ambulances conveying critical cases, enabling them to arrive faster at the hospitals. Road users also play a crucial role to reduce response times by giving way to ambulances and other emergency vehicles. On-going public education efforts have helped to raise awareness, and motorists are generally cooperative.                "
initiatives for next general election,"Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Prime Minister whether he can provide an update on the new initiatives planned for the next general election, in particular (i) the e-registration of voters (ii) the new prototype booth design and (iii) any other changes made to the conduct of the voting process on Polling Day.","Mr Chan Chun Sing (for the Prime Minister): Mr Png asked for an update on the new initiatives for the next general election. As announced previously, ELD intends to implement e-registration of voters to make the process more efficient. This will be ready for the next general election. For the polling booths, ELD worked with students from the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT), and a prototype booth using low-cost environmental-friendly recyclable material appears promising. ELD is in the process of finalising the design with SIT and will pilot these booths at the next election, if ready. ELD has also designed a portable booth so that voters on wheelchairs can mark their ballot papers by placing such booths on their lap.ELD will also introduce the use of self-inking pens, which imprint an 'X', to allow voters to mark their choice clearly and easily without ambiguity. Such self-inking pens require minimum pressure to mark the ballot papers, making it easy for everyone, including the elderly to use. During vote counting, the use of this self-inking pen will reduce the need for Assistant Returning Officers (AROs) to adjudicate ballot papers, since the voters' choice are clearly marked. ELD will arrange to show these new initiatives to representatives of political parties and allow them to try and provide feedback on the new equipment later this year. ELD will subsequently conduct roadshows to familiarise voters with the new equipment."
swapping of car registration number plates with another car's plate,Mr Yee Chia Hsing asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the swapping of car registration number plates with another car's plate is an offence if the swap is done outside of Singapore for purposes of avoiding traffic summons in a foreign country; and (b) how many drivers have been fined for displaying an incorrect car registration number over the past three years.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: If the swapping of number plates is done outside Singapore, whether it is an offence will depend on the facts of the case. For instance, it is an offence if the driver is also found to be in possession of the false plate with the intention to deceive in Singapore, where the driver may be punished with a fine of up to $5,000 and/or a jail sentence of up to 12 months. We would be happy to share information, to the extent permitted by our laws, with our foreign counterparts to assist with investigations into any other possible offences under foreign laws. It is an offence to display false number plates in Singapore. Anyone found doing so may be punished with a fine of up to $5,000 and/or a jail sentence of up to 12 months. Between 2017 and 2018, there were six persons convicted of displaying false number plates. Three of them received jail sentences of four to nine weeks, while the other three had fines imposed.  "
adoption of fair tenancy framework by landlords in retail sector,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Trade and Industry how widespread is the adoption of the Fair Tenancy Framework by landlords in the retail sector and whether the Ministry has taken steps to promote its adoption.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: The Fair Tenancy Framework was developed by the Singapore Business Federation (SBF) in 2015. The Framework encourages tenants and landlords to conduct open, transparent and fair tenancy negotiations by establishing a set of clear leasing guidelines and negotiation principles for businesses looking to rent premises for commercial activities. Since the launch of the Framework, SBF has been actively promoting its adoption through its SME Conventions and quarterly seminars. SBF does not collect statistics on the adoption rates of the Framework. The Government welcomes this ground-up initiative by the business community. Government landlords which offer retail space to the private sector, such as HDB, are broadly aligned with the Framework. The Government has also released more data on retail rents to help retail SMEs make more informed leasing decisions.                        "
take-up rate of 3gen flats,"Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for National Development in respect of the take-up rate of 3Gen HDB flats at recent BTOs, what are the reasons for the current response and what does HDB intend to do for those 3Gen flats that remain unsold after repeated Sale of Balance Flats exercises.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Three-Generation (3Gen) flats are specifically designed for multi-generation families who wish to live under one roof. The response to 3Gen flats has been encouraging, with about seven in ten units booked since such flats were introduced in 2013. In general, the take-up rate of flats in each Build-To-Order (BTO) project depends on many factors, including distance from the city centre, proximity to transport nodes, and amenities in the neighbourhood.Like all other balance flats, unsold 3Gen flats are subsequently offered for sale under the Sale of Balance Flats and Re-Offer of Balance Flats exercises. Unselected units from these two exercises will then be made available for open booking throughout the year.HDB will continue to monitor the demand for 3Gen flats and calibrate the supply accordingly."
singapore's efforts in asean to lead green economy and counter climate change,Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether he can provide an update on Singapore's efforts and strategy in ASEAN to lead and boost the green economy and counter climate change; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider working with other agencies to build a bigger climate financing ecosystem here via incentives and lowering bank capital requirements for climate-friendly investments.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Located in a region with long coastlines and heavily-populated low-lying areas, ASEAN Member States (AMS) are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. ASEAN's efforts to tackle climate change have been directed toward sustainable development and the building of smart and efficient cities, which also support the growth of a green economy.ASEAN cooperation on climate change is under the purview of the ASEAN Working Group on Climate Change (AWGCC). As Chair for the period 2017 to 2019, Singapore works closely with AMS and international development partners to drive the implementation of the AWGCC Action Plan (2016-2025), which covers climate adaptation and mitigation, capability building, climate finance, and cross-sectoral coordination. AMS are currently working on 18 projects and activities endorsed by the AWGCC. Singapore also launched the Climate Action Package at the Special ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Climate Action last July, to provide training and capacity building for participating countries to take climate mitigation and adaptation measures, which in turn also help to make their economies more resilient.Singapore has also been driving action at the city level. One of our key initiatives as ASEAN Chair last year was the establishment of the ASEAN Smart Cities Network (ASCN), a collaborative platform for AMS to work towards smart and sustainable development. Singapore will continue to support Thailand as the current Chair of ASEAN to advance this work under its ""Advancing Partnership for Sustainability"" agenda. However, Governments cannot tackle climate change alone. We need to mobilise private capital to support sustainable development and facilitate the region's transition to a low-carbon and climate resilient economy. My Ministry works closely with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to promote sustainable financing in Singapore and the region. Let me outline our efforts in three key areas.First, non-bank financing solutions like green bonds can play a bigger role in the financing of green investments. MAS introduced the Green Bond Grant Scheme in 2017 to spur the use of capital markets instruments for green financing and to promote the adoption of standards for green investment products. The grant helps to offset the cost of obtaining an external review to ensure that the green bonds are aligned with internationally accepted standards. In February this year, the grant scheme was expanded to include social and sustainability bonds, and renamed the Sustainable Bond Grant Scheme (SBGS). To date, over SGD 6 billion of green bonds have been issued in Singapore. MAS has also lowered the minimum issuance size requirement for the SBGS, which will allow more qualifying issuers to access the grant. Second, MAS is working closely with banks to strengthen their management of environmental risks and support sustainable financing. Over the past years, the banks have been enhancing their relevant policies and processes. In April this year, our local banks announced their decisions to cease financing of new coal-fired power plants, and are working with their customers to make the transition to cleaner forms of energy production. As a member of the Network for Greening the Financial System, MAS works closely with our international counterparts to develop best practices for banks to manage environmental risks and seize opportunities. These international forums are studying the use of capital and other regulatory requirements to promote sustainable financing. As capital requirements are intended to ensure that banks have sufficient capacity to withstand losses, any reduction in capital should be justified by lower risks posed by exposure to sustainable financing.Third, MAS is working with local and international partners to strengthen the capability and capacity of the financial sector to support sustainable financing activities. For example, MAS has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the International Finance Corporation, which aims to raise the awareness and knowledge of green bonds through capacity building workshops. The continued growth of sustainable financing requires a coordinated and collective effort involving the financial sector, businesses, the Government and civil society. My Ministry will continue to work closely with the MAS and other government agencies to support our sustainable financing efforts and drive climate action in Singapore.                      "
review of smart nation initiatives to improve reach and access to persons with disabilities,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Communications and Information whether there will be regular reviews of Smart Nation initiatives on improving reach and access to persons with disabilities.,"Mr S Iswaran: A key priority of Singapore's Smart Nation strategy is to ensure all Singaporeans can participate in and benefit from our digital transformation journey. This is reflected in the Digital Readiness Blueprint that MCI launched last year. Over the years, the Government has ensured that vulnerable segments of our society are included in our digital transformation journey. Initiatives such as IMDA's NEU PC Plus and Enable IT programmes, and the Assistive Technology Fund administered by SG Enable, provide support for persons with disabilities in their use of technology. For persons with disabilities living in a low-income household, the NEU PC Plus Programme enables them to buy a PC at a subsidised rate, while the Assistive Technology Fund subsidises the cost of assistive technology for purposes, such as early intervention, education and training. In addition, the Enable IT programme encourages the adoption of Infocomm and Assistive Technologies (IT/AT) to enable independent living. We regularly refine and update our initiatives, and are ready to tap on opportunities to deliver better outcomes. The development of assistive technology is such an opportunity that has the potential to make big improvements to the way persons with disabilities complete tasks and activities. As a new initiative to enhance the Enable IT programme, IMDA recently supported SPD, a charity which supports people with disabilities of all ages, to set up 4 IT/AT satellite loan libraries to better provide Polytechnic students with access to IT/AT.The Government has also adopted the Digital Service Standards to ensure that digital Government services are inclusive by design, and accessible to groups such as the visually impaired. These standards were recently enhanced and published in October 2018, and we regularly review them to ensure that all Singaporeans can benefit.We are committed to continually ensure that our Smart Nation journey is inclusive to all Singaporeans, including persons with disabilities, and we will do so by working with the people, public and private sectors. One such platform is the cross-sectoral workgroup that MSF launched this year to promote independent living through technology and design, in the home setting as well as within the community. The workgroup is co-chaired by the Minister of State for Social and Family Development, Mr Sam Tan, and President of SPD, Ms Chia Yong Yong.              "
number of users who have changed singpass id to non-nric login,"Mr Mohamed Irshad asked the Prime Minister (a) since 2015, how many individuals have changed their SingPass ID to a non-NRIC detail; (b) whether the Ministry has studied the use of other unique user IDs for SingPass login; and (c) what efforts have been undertaken to inform users of the option to change their SingPass user ID to a non-NRIC detail.","Mr Lee Hsien Loong: To date, 26,000 users have changed their SingPass user ID to a non-NRIC ID. The NRIC number is used as the default user ID as it is unique and easy to remember. Users have the option to change this, and this information is publicised on the SingPass website.  Knowing one's NRIC number or the user ID alone is not enough to access his or her SingPass account. In addition to the user ID, third parties would also need to know the second authentication factor, in the form of one-time passwords received via SMS or the OneKey token, before they can access any SingPass account.  Last October, we launched the SingPass Mobile app to offer a more secure and convenient way for users to login to their SingPass accounts. The app uses a cryptographic-based software token for authentication, and is further protected using the phone's biometrics login or a user-specified PIN code. We recently updated the app to provide shortcuts to popular Government e-services, and to view your SingPass transaction history. Over 300,000 users have downloaded the app, and the feedback has been very positive. We will continue to improve the app regularly.  We strongly encourage users to download the SingPass Mobile. We also wish to remind the public to practice good cyber hygiene, and not share their username, password and 2FA details with anyone.       "
work injury insurance for food delivery riders,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Manpower how is the Ministry working with the food delivery companies to ensure that their food delivery riders using PMDs are provided with work injury insurance.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) works with food delivery companies on measures to prevent accidents and injuries in the first place. MOM and the Workplace Safety and Health Council (WSHC) have partnered with the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and Traffic Police on initiatives to inculcate safe riding practices among delivery riders. These initiatives include running the annual Singapore Ride Safe campaign and publishing a guide on safe riding.  Food delivery companies are required to purchase work injury compensation insurance for their employed delivery riders. These riders are eligible for compensation under the Work Injury Compensation Act if they are injured at work. Companies have control over their employees' work arrangements and are therefore responsible for compensation if their employees are injured in the course of work.  For self-employed delivery riders, they may choose their own work arrangements such as driving their own vehicles and managing their own working hours. In addition, they can work for multiple delivery companies. In this regard, companies do not have full control over the SEP work arrangements and are thus not required to purchase work injury compensation insurance for them.Nonetheless, WSHC has engaged food delivery companies to encourage them to provide personal accident insurance for all their delivery riders, including those who are self-employed. Several major operators like Deliveroo and GrabFood already do.WSHC will publish an updated guide on safe riding later this year that will include insurance coverage for riders as a good industry practice. It will highlight that a self-employed rider hurt in an accident caused by another vehicle can also claim against the vehicle owner's motor insurance."
gas leak cases in hdb flats,"Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) in the past three years, how many incidences of gas leaks have occurred in HDB flats; (b) what are the reasons for these leaks; (c) how often are gas pipes checked and serviced; and (d) what other routine preventive measures are taken to ensure these incidences are kept to the minimum.","Mr Chan Chun Sing: There were 3,698 cases of gas leaks involving HDB flats in the past three years. This is equivalent to an annual average of 0.15% of all HDB flats with town gas pipes.  Most of these cases are minor leaks with the common causes including loose connections to the gas appliances, corroded/damaged pipes, or damaged gas appliances. As a safety measure, homeowners must engage a gas service worker licensed by Energy Market Authority (EMA) to install the town gas pipes and gas appliances, as well as test for gas leakages, before their gas supply can be turned on. Subsequently, PowerGas, which maintains the town gas network, is responsible for inspecting the gas pipes within HDB flats once every 15 years to check for any gas leaks or defects in gas installations.  As an added safety precaution, City Gas is required to odorise town gas to make it easier to detect a gas leak. Homeowners who suspect a leak can contact the emergency services hotlines, as well as PowerGas' 24-hour hotline. PowerGas will dispatch a response team within an hour. Additionally, EMA and PowerGas regularly use various platforms to raise public awareness about gas safety, such as how to respond to a suspected gas leak.  "
breakdown of local versus foreign visitors at singapore places of attractions,"Mr Seah Kian Peng asked the Minister for Trade and Industry in each of the past five years, what is the breakdown of Singaporean versus foreign visitors to (i) Singapore Zoological Gardens (ii) Gardens by the Bay and (iii) Sentosa Island.","Mr Chan Chun Sing: From 2014 to 2018, local visitors to the Singapore Zoological Gardens have remained at about 1.8 million a year. The number of tourist visitors increased from 2.0 million in 2014 to 2.7 million in 2018, in tandem with the growth in visitors to Singapore.The Singapore Zoo, Night Safari, and River Safari will be rejuvenated to complement the two upcoming parks, an indoor attraction, and an eco-resort that is being developed in Mandai.For Gardens by the Bay, which has both gated and ungated attractions, the number of local visitors grew from 4.3 million in 2014 to 6.4 million in 2018. The number of tourist visitors grew from 2.5 million to 6.0 million over the same period.For Sentosa, the number of local visitors fell from 7.5 million in 2014 to 4.2 million in 2018, while the number of tourist visitors grew from 11.8 million to 15.5 million. Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC) is reviewing its plans and piloting new ideas to attract more locals by increasing the range and affordability of Sentosa's offerings. For example, the free-for-entry Sentosa FunFest, held during this year's March school holidays, featured more than 800 Sanrio inflatables along Palawan Beach, along with a Kid's Maze and a foam pool. The event attracted over 140,000 visitors over nine days. SDC is also working with private sector partners to implement the new initiatives, including night events and unique attractions that will appeal to both locals and tourists.              "
accidents involving cyclists and pmd users at bus stops,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Transport (a) how many accidents have there been over the last one year involving cyclists and PMD users at bus stops; (b) how can the Ministry better protect commuters at bus stops; and (c) what are the efforts to improve safer usage of bicycles and PMDs at bus stops.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: In the past year, there were 18 reported accidents involving cyclists and personal mobility device (PMD) users at or near bus stops. LTA has been progressively undertaking infrastructural improvements at bus stops to improve safety, by building cycling paths and widening footpaths behind bus stops with high commuter traffic. The aim is to allow cyclists and PMD users to go behind the bus stop rather than through it. The widened paths include additional safety features, such as speed regulating strips, ""Look"" and ""Slow"" markings and ""Give Way to Pedestrians"" signs. LTA will continue with these infrastructural improvements where possible.In addition, LTA regularly highlights safe riding practices in its nationwide public education campaigns. These include reminders to: ""always give way to pedestrians"", ""slow down when approaching bus stops"" and ""walk your device in crowded areas"". To date, more than 46,000 individuals have attended the Safe Riding Programme, which teaches riders to slow down, walk their devices, or dismount and push their devices at bus stops, amongst other safe riding habits.                       "
approval to operate commercial shared pmd services,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether any company has been approved to operate commercial shared PMD services on public footpaths and public parks; (b) if so, when did this take place and which companies have been awarded; (c) if not, when are approvals expected; and (d) whether an update can be provided on the latest conditions and restrictions which have been imposed or which the LTA intends to impose in respect of the operation of commercial shared PMD services by proposed operators.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The award of PMD-sharing licences has been deferred to later this year as the Land Transport Authority (LTA) requires more time to review the imposition of additional requirements on licensees to ensure the safety of users and the general public. The requirements being considered include requiring shared PMDs to be certified to the UL2272 standard to ensure fire safety, and to be insured against third-party claims on bodily injury or death. LTA will also start conservatively, restricting sandbox licensees to small fleet sizes over a 1-year sandbox period."
managing fumes and odour from converted eateries in residential areas,"Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for National Development in respect of the conversion of shops to eateries at shopping malls, whether URA will consider introducing an approval system to address potential problems dealing with fumes and odour that may emanate from the converted eateries to nearby residential areas and to impose quantifiable odour and fume standards for all eateries to observe.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Shopping malls are sited on land zoned by URA for commercial use. Restaurants, including eating houses, cafés, and food courts, are an allowable commercial use in shopping malls.  There are currently no established standards or limits for food-related odours. Nevertheless, to minimise dis-amenities caused by the discharge of fumes and odours, developers and managing agents of premises with eateries and individual eateries are required by NEA and SFA to install exhaust systems with air cleaning functions. They are also required to direct their exhaust outlets away from neighbouring premises as much as possible, and ensure that their exhaust systems are kept clean and properly maintained.                                    "
terms of operations for virtual banks,Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked the Prime Minister (a) what are the operating terms for virtual banks as compared with traditional banks; (b) whether MAS will ensure that there is a level playing field for all; and (c) what is the impact of lower operational costs for virtual banks on consumers and the industry.,"Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): MAS has announced that it will be issuing up to five new digital bank licences, which will comprise up to two digital full bank licences that can access retail deposits, and up to three digital wholesale bank licences that will cater to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and other non-retail segments. This is in addition to any digital banks that Singapore banking groups may establish under MAS' existing internet banking framework introduced in 2000. The move will provide space in our banking system for innovative non-bank players, and help spur further innovation in banking. In the same vein, MAS had announced in September last year that non-bank payment institutions will be granted direct access to the real time payments network between banks, also known as Fast and Secure Transfer (FAST). MAS' operating terms for the new digital banks will be calibrated to maintain the trust and stability that are the hallmarks of Singapore's banking system. Let me elaborate.First, MAS will carefully evaluate the sustainability of applicants' business models. They must not engage in value-destructive competition to gain market share. MAS will monitor market dynamics and, where necessary, impose additional supervisory requirements or restrictions to deter such behaviour. The aim here is to avoid unsustainable banking practices, and to preserve a level playing field among banks. Second, we will also preserve a level playing field in prudential requirements. The digital banks will have to meet the same capital and liquidity requirements as existing banks. They will be subject to the same consumer lending rules, such as limits on unsecured credit extended and loan-to-value ratios for mortgages. Digital full banks will also be required to participate in the deposit insurance scheme, which will cover an individual’s deposits of up to S$75,000.Third, to minimise risks to retail depositors, MAS will phase in the permissible activities of digital full banks via a two-stage process. A digital full bank will commence as a restricted digital bank to build up its business model and internal processes, and gradually progress to become a full-fledged full bank. At the entry stage, a restricted bank will be subject to an aggregate deposit cap of S$50 million and an individual depositor cap of S$75,000. While digital wholesale banks are not subject to the two-stage process, MAS will impose appropriate activity restrictions in its initial years of operations to mitigate the risks of untested business models.  MAS' regulatory and supervisory frameworks support the stability of the system as a whole, and help preserve sound practices among individual banks. But MAS, like all financial regulators, cannot guarantee that individual banks will not fail, whether they are digital banks or otherwise. It hence remains important for consumers to be aware of the risks, and of the extent of protection that they will be accorded under the deposit insurance scheme if a bank fails. Mr Saktiandi asked about the impact of digital banks' operational costs on consumers. Digital banks are likely to operate with new technology stacks and may have more nimble solutions that enable lower operational costs than traditional banks. This can potentially benefit customers and the broader economy. New digital banks could potentially offer deposit accounts without imposing any minimum deposit amount or fall-below fees, as seen in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong.Digital banks with access to more wide-ranging data sources could adopt different credit risk assessment approaches to lend to under-served segments of the economy like young and micro enterprises.Further, the increased competition from digital banks is likely to spur existing banks to improve further on their own digital offerings.We are confident that the calibrated opening of banking to new digital players will benefit consumers and businesses, while preserving stability. It should ensure that Singapore's banking sector continues to be resilient, competitive and vibrant."
assistance to elderly homeowners who may have difficulty checking areas in their homes for mosquitoes to prevent spread of dengue,"Mr Chong Kee Hiong asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources in view of the recent dengue situation, what assistance measures can be offered to home owners, especially the elderly, who are unable to check on areas beyond their reach such as gutters.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: As of 29 June, there were over 6,100 reported dengue cases in 2019, which is about four times the number of cases in the same period in 2018. We are entering the traditional peak dengue season and a national collective effort is critical to stem the transmission of dengue. Inspections conducted by the National Environment Agency (NEA) showed that 60% of all Aedes aegypti breeding habitats detected were in homes. This proportion was even higher in dengue clusters, with 74% of breeding habitats detected in homes. Therefore, home-owners play a crucial role in keeping dengue at bay. I urge all residents to take immediate action to eradicate potential mosquito breeding habitats by practicing the 5-step Mozzie Wipeout regularly, and stepping up housekeeping measures. All residents living in cluster areas should also cooperate with NEA officers to facilitate checks and carry out indoor misting in homes. Community support is an integral part of the national effort to raise awareness and drive action on the ground. NEA, together with Dengue Prevention Volunteers, works closely with Grassroots Advisers, Neighbourhood Committees (NCs) and Residents’ Committees (RCs) to reach out to residents. NCs and RCs can assist households with elderly members to check their homes and remove stagnant water to prevent mosquito breeding. Households can take preventive measures such as avoiding the use of flowerpot plates for ornamental plants. Home owners with roof gutters that are difficult to access can engage pest control operators to check for stagnant water and apply Bti insecticide, if they are unable to do so themselves. A typical Bti briquette can remain effective for about 30 days. NEA is stepping up efforts to stem dengue transmission. Over 440 dengue prevention events have been organised since the launch of this year's National Dengue Prevention Campaign in April. However, the government alone cannot prevent dengue transmission in Singapore. I encourage everyone, including our silver generation, to be an advocate of dengue prevention and to remind our family members and neighbours to join in this national effort.           "
cause of substation fire at carlton hotel,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what is the cause of the SP Power Grid (SPPG) Substation fire at the Carlton Hotel in February 2019; (b) what is the result of the investigation into the SPPG Substation fire at Bright Hill in January 2019; (c) whether any equipment at fault in these incidents is scheduled for replacement or maintenance; and (d) what measures have been taken to address the risk of recurrence.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: Based on EMA's investigations, the power failure at the Carlton Hotel on 14 February 2019 was due to a short circuit in the substation switchgear, which started a fire. The insulation between two components in the switchgear had failed due to heat stress from foreign contaminants, which could have been introduced during maintenance. EMA determined that had SP Power Grid (SPPG) complied with its standard operating procedure (SOP) for monitoring work, the incident could have been prevented. As a result, EMA imposed a financial penalty of $1,000,000 on SPPG.As for the power failure at Bright Hill that occurred on 26 January 2019, EMA's investigations showed that a faulty voltage transformer (VT) had started a fire in the substation. EMA found that SPPG was using the faulty VT beyond its Original Equipment Manufacturer's (OEM) recommended lifespan. Thus, EMA imposed a financial penalty of $750,000 on SPPG. SPPG is replacing all the VTs that have exceeded their lifespan, starting with those of a similar make and model as the faulty VT in Bright Hill. EMA has also worked with SPPG to place such equipment within a protection zone where, in the event of failure, the impact will be isolated to minimise the risk of a cascading effect affecting other substations.The Government takes a serious view of ensuring that our power system remains reliable and secure. EMA has also stepped up its regulatory oversight on how SPPG monitors and maintains the health of our power system.  Separately, SPPG has engaged an independent consultant to review and recommend enhancements to its equipment replacement and maintenance regime, as well as its monitoring work practices. As a result, SPPG is putting more resources into monitoring and maintaining substations and renewing key assets. They will also extend the use of technologies such as online condition monitoring and deepen the core skills of their workforce. EMA will continue to work closely with SPPG to ensure a high standard of reliability for our power system.  "
managing operators and protecting the public in potential shake-up in banking system,"Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling asked the Prime Minister in light of Facebook's plans to introduce the Libra cryptocurrency, whether he will consider introducing regulatory changes to manage a potential shake-up in the banking system and to protect the public from the perspectives of market competitiveness and data privacy.","Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): Libra is, according to Facebook, a new digital currency aimed at lowering the cost of payments, and bringing the unbanked into the financial system. Facebook plans to launch Libra with an association of technology companies, including partners such as PayPal, Uber and Visa.At this point, however, we do not have details as to how the Libra Association plans to implement its solution. It is in the early stages of development, with a number of issues to be worked out around its features, use cases, and governance arrangements. Like other regulators around the world, MAS will make an informed assessment of the potential benefits and risks of Libra once these details become clear. Singapore now has a relatively developed ecosystem of e-wallets and bank apps that allow for secure, convenient, and efficient domestic payments and transfers. Even so, we are open to further innovations, particularly if they can bring about additional benefits without undermining the stability and integrity of the financial system.Miss Chan asked whether regulatory changes will be considered in response to Libra. The Payment Services Act (PS Act) was introduced to provide new and innovative payment products and services with regulatory certainty. The Act covers cryptocurrencies, or digital payment tokens (DPT) as we would call it, as well as e-money, and domestic and cross-border fund transfers. Depending on its nature, Libra may be regulated under the PS Act, and be subject to requirements on anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism imposed under the MAS Act. As for personal data privacy, all entities operating in Singapore that collect personal data are subject to the requirements of the Personal Data Protection Act.MAS will continue to engage Facebook on its plans for Libra, and consider appropriate regulatory responses once they are clear.  "
sufficient workers involved in preventive maintenance of mrt lines,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether there are sufficient workers currently at the two rail operators to carry out preventive maintenance of the MRT lines effectively; and (b) what are the plans by the Ministry to ensure that there are adequate skilled technical workers for rail maintenance in view of the introduction and opening of new MRT lines.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Effective and timely maintenance is necessary to ensure a reliable MRT service. Besides hardware investments, we also require a skilled maintenance workforce. Today, our rail operators deploy more than 50% of their headcount, or more than 4,000 staff, to maintenance and engineering. Thanks to their tireless efforts, our MRT service has stabilised, with a reliability level comparable to that of Taipei Metro and Hong Kong MTR. We need to maintain this staffing level for existing MRT lines. But as our MRT network is still expanding, we work closely with the rail operators and the National Transport Workers' Union (NTWU), to continuously upskill and reskill existing workers, and to attract a healthy pipeline of new workers.In 2016, LTA launched the $12.5 million Public Transport Manpower Development Fund, or PTMDF in short, to attract, develop, and retain skilled workers in the public transport industry. Under the PTMDF, we introduced Rail Industry Training Grants to co-fund courses for rail technicians and engineers. The PTMDF also co-funds the Public Transport Study Awards offered to prospective ITE, polytechnic, and university students keen to embark on a technical career with the rail operators. In addition, we also collaborate with Workforce Singapore and SkillsFuture Singapore on wider initiatives to enhance the capabilities of public transport workers. This includes the Skills Framework for Public Transport to define a career development roadmap and support competency-based training for public transport workers. Together with Workforce Singapore, we also offer Professional Conversion Programmes to help mid-career workers make the switch into the public transport industry.  We will continue to engage the stakeholders to see how we can further deepen and widen efforts in this area.         "
further attempts for bus-on-demand trial,Prof Lim Sun Sun asked the Minister for Transport in view of the discontinuation of the bus-on-demand trial due to high software development costs and poor commuter take-up (a) whether options to lower such costs have been explored through opening up software development to more players; and (b) whether a more concerted effort to educate commuters could be made before concluding the trial.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The six-month on-demand public bus or ODPB trial was concluded last month. It has achieved its objective of providing insights on resource requirements and commuter acceptance. We found the ODPB to be less cost effective than regular bus services. One factor was the high software development costs. This is so even though the open tender attracted competitive bids from ten local and overseas players. As with all new technologies, public acceptance takes time and effort. LTA worked with both the ODPB operators and software developers to raise awareness among commuters in the trial areas. Posters were put up at major public transport nodes, and ground ambassadors were deployed to offer assistance to commuters. LTA also engaged stakeholders directly served by the ODPB services. While some commuters were initially uncomfortable with booking a bus ride using mobile phones, many gave it a try with more than 29,000 rides booked and taken. LTA is open to conducting further trials of the on-demand concept in future. As the technology matures, we can expect the large-scale deployment of ODPB to be more cost effective. We will also build on these initial engagement efforts to educate commuters on the concept.  "
checks in water meters to ensure absence of leakage,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether PUB conducts regular checks on water meters of residents' homes to ensure that there is no leakage; and (b) what is the follow-up process when residents suspect that their water meters may be faulty.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Water fixtures and fittings, such as pipes and water taps, undergo natural wear and tear and require periodic repair and maintenance. It is the responsibility of home owners to maintain these fixtures and fittings, to ensure that there is no water leakage within their homes. Water meter readings are taken by SP Services, PUB's billing agent, once every two months. If SP Services detects exceptionally high or low usage, SP Services and PUB will carry out checks and investigations. If the meter is faulty, PUB will replace the meter. If the leak is suspected to involve home water fixtures and fittings, PUB will alert the home owner to look into it. Residents who suspect leaks in their homes can turn off all the taps in the house and check their water meters. If the water meter counter dial is still running, there may be a leak in the home. The resident should then engage a licensed plumber to trace and repair the leak. Residents can also contact SP Services to request for the meter to be checked By 2023, PUB will install 300,000 smart water meters in new and existing premises through the first phase of its Smart Water Meter Programme. Once rolled out, residents with smart meters will have ready access to their daily water usage data through a mobile application or an online portal, and be promptly alerted to suspected leaks."
number of visitors at changi airport's jewel and reported injuries there,"Mr Ang Wei Neng asked the Minister for Transport (a) how many visitors, locals and foreigners, have visited Jewel since its opening; (b) how many injury cases have been reported at the Jewel; and (c) what are the steps that the Ministry has taken to improve its safety measures.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: More than 24 million visitors have visited Jewel Changi Airport since it opened to the public on 11 April 2019.There have been nine reported incidents with injuries at Jewel. Five were escalator-related which the Building and Construction Authority has investigated. They found no technical safety issues and the incidents were due to unsafe user behaviour, such as brushing footwear against the side of an escalator. Four incidents took place at the Jewel Canopy Park. Investigations by Jewel Changi Airport confirmed that the incidents were not caused by technical problems.Meanwhile, Jewel Changi Airport is taking steps to improve safety. It is installing additional signages to remind visitors to exercise care. Jewel Hosts stationed at the attractions will also be extra vigilant in looking out for unsafe behaviours.        "
proposal for house unions in ministries and statutory boards to be regarded as part of organisational structure,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Prime Minister whether house unions in the various Ministries and statutory boards can be regarded as part of the organisational structure and hence be allowed to occupy office space within the building premises without being charged market rental.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing (for the Prime Minister): House unions are valued partners of public sector agencies, but are not part of the organisational structure. They are separate entities regulated by the Trade Unions Act and other legislation administered by the Registry of Trade Unions. In general, public sector agencies allow their union branch leaders to use their non-exclusive office facilities, such as meeting rooms, without any charges. They are accorded the same treatment as any other employees who need to use the office facilities. However, in instances where the unions have requested for dedicated office space for their exclusive use, they would be charged market rental rates. This is in line with the Ministry of Finance's policy that all government premises should be rented at market rates.   "
raising awareness about children and young adults with autism,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what are the current efforts to raise the awareness of Singaporeans regarding children and young adults with autism; (b) what has been done to ensure that these autistic individuals continue to have access to resources and provisions; (c) how can the Government and society partner each other to further raise awareness and enhance access to resources and provisions; and (d) whether there will be more efforts to help autistic individuals integrate into society and lead meaningful lives.,"Mr Desmond Lee: The Government closely partners the people, private and public sector to raise awareness of autism and provide support to persons with autism. Several Social Service Agencies, such as the Autism Resource Centre, the Autism Association Singapore, St. Andrew's Autism Centre, AWWA, and Rainbow Centre are committed to serving persons with autism and their families. We work with these agencies, and other partners, to raise awareness of autism, provide for detection and early intervention, educational support in the schooling years, job support, social inclusion and care services. Persons with autism or their caregivers can also approach SG Enable for information and referral to various support services.A key factor to greater inclusion is improving awareness and understanding of autism. The National Council for Social Service (NCSS) has been running the ""See the True Me"" campaign since 2016, in partnership with the Tote Board. The campaign encourages the public to see persons with disability for who they are, instead of the disability that they have. It has also helped to raise awareness of autism by showcasing the abilities of persons with autism, and by profiling employers with inclusive hiring practices.We tap on the network of polyclinics and GPs to detect autism in children early. Polyclinics and GPs may refer children to the Child Development Programme at KKH and NUH for diagnosis of developmental concerns, including autism.Children diagnosed to be at risk of autism are referred to subsidised Early Intervention services for developmental and therapy intervention. For children with moderate to severe developmental needs, they are supported through the Early Intervention Programme for Infants and Children, provided at 21 Early Intervention centres across Singapore. Children with mild developmental needs receive short-term targeted intervention through the Developmental Support and Learning Support programmes in some 550 preschools.Earlier this year, I announced enhancements to make early intervention services more affordable and more customised. The subsidy enhancements have lowered the out-of-pocket expenses for early intervention services for most families by 30% to 70%. We are progressively rolling out more customised early intervention services, such as the Development Support Plus programme, to support children with mild to moderate developmental needs within preschools. This will give parents greater assurance that intervention is tailored to their child’s specific needs, and build a stronger foundation for the child to develop to his or her fullest potential.During the schooling years, students with mild autism who can access the national curriculum are supported in mainstream schools by specialised manpower, such as teachers trained in special needs and Allied Educators for Learning and Behavioural Support. These Allied Educators are able to provide group intervention for students with autism to learn social and communication skills. Specialised school-based intervention programmes are also available to support students with mild developmental needs, including autism. For example, students with both dyslexia and mild autism would be supported by the school-based dyslexia remediation programme to build up literacy skills. Those with moderate to severe autism who require more intensive and specialised assistance in their education are supported in special education (SPED) schools, such as Pathlight, AWWA School and St. Andrew's Autism School.We also work with partners to help young persons with autism prepare for working life. For example, the School-to-Work Transition Programme offers customised training pathways and work options for students with disability, including those with autism. This is a multi-agency collaboration between MOE, MSF, SG Enable, and the SPED schools, to support students in their transition from school to employment.SG Enable offers Disability Awareness and Disability Management courses to enhance the capabilities of employers looking to hire and retain persons with disabilities. SG Enable also partners the Autism Resource Centre, or ARC, to provide job seekers with autism with job placement and support. ARC runs an Employability and Employment Centre, located within the Enabling Village, to provide training and customised employment to persons with autism. Opening more opportunities for employment also requires changing the mindsets of employers and customers who interact with employees with autism. Under the ""See the True Me"" campaign, KFC Singapore, which hires over 90 employees with disabilities, came up with specially designed tray-mats. These tray-mats contain tips for patrons on interacting with persons with disabilities, for example, encouraging them to be patient. Minister for State Mr Zaqy Mohamad will share more on Government’s efforts to integrate persons with disabilities, including those with autism, into the workforce.There are also ongoing efforts to support opportunities for persons with autism to contribute to the wider community. For example, NCSS has worked with a group of community partners1 to engage persons with disabilities, including those with autism, to deliver customised dinner meal sets to vulnerable seniors. These volunteer and social interaction opportunities help persons with autism form social networks within the community.We also set up the Special Needs Trust Company to support parents and caregivers with subsidised trust and care planning services.Recently, we launched several workgroups with cross-sectoral representation, including members of the disability community, to look at making preschools more inclusive, improving employment opportunities, and increasing the ease of independent living for persons with disabilities. Going forward, we will continue to take a whole-of-society approach to supporting persons with autism throughout their lives, to enable persons with autism to realise their true potential as integral members of society."
steps to ensure law firms strengthen it processes and cyber security,"Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Law in light of scammers targeting law firms and impersonating lawyers (a) what steps will be taken to ensure law firms strengthen their IT processes and cyber security; (b) whether any assessment of the state of cyber security awareness amongst law firms has been done; (c) if not, whether the Ministry will consider conducting such an assessment; and (d) how can victims of such scams be assisted to recover their lost monies.","Mr K Shanmugam: The recent reports in the media of scammers impersonating conveyancing lawyers, involved hackers targeting the clients' email accounts, rather than the systems or email accounts of the law practices or lawyers in question. The scammers then sent emails with payment instructions which differed from what the lawyers had earlier told their clients. Unfortunately, these victims then proceeded to carry out these payments – one of them doing so even though their lawyer clarified that no such instruction had been given by the law firm.Following these incidents, the Law Society of Singapore has taken steps to highlight the need for careful scrutiny of payment instructions or requests. The Law Society maintains a section on their website with information on email scams targeting lawyers.1 It has also released two advisories to lawyers and conducted a media conference in relation to the recent scams, highlighting steps which lawyers can take to keep themselves, their law practices and their clients safe.Law practices, as with any other business, are ultimately responsible for their own IT processes, data protection and cybersecurity. All private sector organisations, including law practices, are also subject to requirements under the Personal Data Protection Act, which imposes on them obligations to protect personal data.In addition, they are supported by a regulatory framework under the Legal Profession Act, to protect clients and guide law practices in best practices within this framework. Lawyers also have a responsibility to maintain the confidentiality of client information, and the management of each law practice has a statutory obligation to ensure that their law practice has adequate systems to comply with client confidentiality requirements in written law and any applicable practice directions, guidance notes and rulings issued by the Law Society or its Council or the Professional Conduct Council.2  To help law practices, the Law Society publishes various Practice Management Guides,3 Guidance Notes4 and Advisories5 on its website, on matters such as security risks to a law practice's IT system, cloud computing, and email security. Separately, the International Bar Association has also published a set of ""Cyber Security Guidelines"" on its website.6 The Personal Data Protection Commission and Cyber Security Agency of Singapore have also issued guides to assist organisations to secure personal data and manage data breaches. Lawyers should take guidance from these publications, and apply them as appropriate to their own practices.At the same time, clients must also exercise personal vigilance and due care to ensure that they do not fall prey to such scams. Members of the public should scrutinise email addresses, links, and attachments carefully in their correspondence, and where appropriate, take additional steps to cross check instructions, especially payment instructions, with their lawyers. Victims of such scams should file a report with the police."
efforts at encouraging companies to be more inclusive to individuals with autism,"Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what are the current efforts to help companies be more inclusive to individuals with autism; (b) how can the Government and society partner each other to help autistic individuals gain employment and better integrate into the workforce; and (c) whether, and how, the tripartite partners are further stepping up their efforts to help autistic individuals train, re-skill and gain meaningful employment amidst economic uncertainty and transformation.","Mrs Josephine Teo: As the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Social and Family Development said in his earlier reply to Miss Cheng, the Government works closely with the people and private sector to raise awareness of autism and provide support to persons with autism. To help autistic individuals gain employment, the Government provides up to 16% wage subsidy, through the Special Employment Credit, to employers who hire persons with disabilities (PwDs), including persons with autism. There is an additional 6% subsidy for PwDs above age 67.  PwDs seeking employment may also tap on programmes under MOM's Adapt and Grow initiative, such as the Open Door Programme (ODP) and Career Trial. ODP, which is administered by SG Enable with funding support from Workforce Singapore (WSG), provides job placement and job support services for PwDs and their employers. PwDs can tap on the job matching, training and other support services provided by partner organisations, including the Autism Resource Centre. At the same time, employers may receive grant support for job redesign and training. From January 2016 to March 2019, more than 2,000 PwDs were placed with close to 750 employers through ODP.Some employers and PwDs may have reservations about job fit and suitability of the work environment. To address these concerns, Career Trial provides opportunities for employers and PwDs to try out each other and assess job fit. During the trial, which can be up to three months, jobseekers receive a training allowance from the Government. There are also ongoing efforts to help PwDs, including persons with autism, integrate into the workforce. Last month, MOM and SG Enable launched the Job Redesign Guide for Inclusive Employers. The Guide provides step-by-step information for companies on how they can redesign jobs to do so – for instance, through changes to the workplace or working arrangements. SG Enable also runs disability management workshops and a biennial Inclusive Business Forum to equip employers with knowledge and skills on how to recruit PwDs and integrate them into the workforce.The Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) has set up a Workgroup, comprising members from the people, private and public sectors, to explore ways to better support PwDs in gaining employment. The Workgroup is co-chaired by Minister of State for Social and Family Development, Mr Sam Tan, and President of the Autism Resource Centre, Ms Denise Phua. MOM and WSG are part of this Workgroup, and will continue to work closely with MSF, SG Enable and community partners to improve employment opportunities for PwDs.  "
efforts to educate and raise awareness for protection from online falsehoods and manipulation act,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Communications and Information with regard to the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (a) what is the Ministry's training plan and guidelines for Ministers and their civil service teams on the use of the Act, especially in the assessment of fact and falsehood; and (b) what public education programmes are being planned on the intent and implications of the Act for ordinary citizens and civil society.","Mr S Iswaran: The Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) is the result of a lengthy and thorough process of consultation and public discussion. MCI and the POFMA Office have been working closely with colleagues from other Ministries to put in place processes and workflows to execute the law when it comes into effect later this year. Ministers, supported by their officers, have the requisite expertise in their diverse domains to assess firstly whether a statement is false, and secondly whether it is in the public interest to act against it. The determination of ""falsehood"" is well-established in law, and Ministries can seek views from AGC on such points of jurisprudence if in doubt. Ministries will also be supported by the POFMA Office, which will provide technical advice to ensure consistency in the implementation of the Act. POFMA will not affect regular conversations and interaction, nor honest participation in public discourse by citizens and civil society. If someone unknowingly shares a falsehood, they may be asked to carry a correction if public interest is involved. Criminal prosecution will be reserved for malicious actors who intentionally create or spread falsehoods, knowing that it can harm society.The Government will work with and support partners in their information and media literacy programmes, to ensure that people have the instincts and skills to look out for falsehoods, and be circumspect when they share information online. A discerning and well-informed public is the best defence against online falsehoods."
individuals disqualified from integrated shield plans due to implementation of medishield plans,Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the Ministry tracks the number of residents who are disqualified from buying the Integrated Shield Plans (IP) offered by private insurers due to the implementation of MediShield Life which covers pre-existing conditions; and (b) how does the Government intend to work with these IP private insurers to benefit policyholders.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: MediShield Life provides universal basic health insurance coverage for life for all Singapore Residents, including those with pre-existing conditions. MediShield Life, together with Government subsidies, MediSave and MediFund, will keep the costs of basic healthcare affordable to subsidised patients. This is the Government’s commitment to all Singaporeans.Integrated Shield Plans (IPs) are optional plans offered by private insurers that provide additional coverage, catering to different preferences beyond MediShield Life, including private healthcare services.  IP insurers have their own underwriting processes and make independent decisions on the provision of coverage to applicants, based on the insurers’ risk assessments and other considerations. IP insurers may choose to reject applications from those with certain pre-existing conditions, or provide cover for individuals with pre-existing conditions with exclusions or risk-loading on premiums. The premiums across insurers also differ. MOH does not intervene in the underwriting process for IPs.Where MOH works closely with IP insurers would be in areas such as public education and financial counselling for the public, as well as the management of healthcare costs in the private sector. The requirement for co-payment among IP riders imposed from April 2019, to bring about more affordable and sustainable healthcare and healthcare insurance, is one such example.             "
recycling items in national day parade funpacks,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Defence for the National Day Parade 2019 funpack (a) whether a reusable water bottle can be provided instead of a single-use plastic bottle; (b) whether alternatives to the plastic bag provided have been considered; and (c) whether the unused poncho collection points can be used to collect other unused funpack items or unwanted funpack bags.,"Dr Ng Eng Hen:  In planning for each NDP, the Executive Committee (Exco) strikes a balance between sustainability goals and the comfort and well-being of Singaporeans who participate and watch the event. The Exco works with the National Environment Agency (NEA) to promote more sustainable practices for each National Day Parade. Drinking water in reusable bottles was considered but not implemented as there were a lack of suppliers which can do so at an affordable cost. Instead, to reduce the use of single-use plastics, the Funpack will have a larger 750ml water bottle instead of the two bottles provided in previous NDPs. To support the Keep Singapore Clean Movement, a plastic bag is included in each Funpack to facilitate the bagging and hygienic disposal of waste. Volunteers will also be at collection points to encourage spectators to leave behind unused ponchos, LED wristbands or the Funpack itself, as well as for them to deposit recyclables such as the 750ml water bottle."
take-up rate by employers for mindef's direct reimbursement claims system,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Defence in respect of the Direct Reimbursement to Employers of Claims for NS Training (DIRECT) scheme, (a) what is the percentage of serving NSmen whose employers are currently enrolled in the scheme; (b) what are the challenges which discourage more employers from using the scheme; and (c) whether the Ministry will enhance the scheme to increase the take-up rate from employers.","Dr Ng Eng Hen: MINDEF initiated and promoted the Direct Reimbursement Scheme to employers, so that their NS employees can continue to draw salaries while performing NS call-ups. MINDEF would subsequently reimburse these employers. Today, 45 percent of employers are on the DIRECT scheme – an increase of 7 percentage points over the past three years. MINDEF will continue to improve this and other schemes to make it easier and faster for NSmen to receive their Make-Up Pay claims. In March this year, the Make-up Pay e-Service was integrated with the Singapore Corporate Access, or CorpPass, which is a corporate digital identity for employers to transact securely with government agencies online. Employers with CorpPass no longer need to have a third officer when submitting claims on the DIRECT scheme. We encourage employers to register with the DIRECT scheme using NS Portal, which helps streamline their Make-up Pay processes for national servicemen employees.      "
cases of parents harassing or abusing teachers,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Education (a) how many cases of parents harassing or abusing teachers have occurred yearly from 2015 to 2018; (b) what measures are in place to ensure that teachers have a safe working environment; and (c) what measures are in place to ensure that teachers who are harassed or abused have access to channels to seek counselling and redress.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: Parents in Singapore are supportive of our schools and work well with our teachers. We have very few cases of harassment or abuse by parents.Teachers and School Leaders are expected to accord appropriate respect and courtesy to parents when engaging them, and MOE expects the same from parents in their interactions with our educators. At the start of 2019, MOE developed and shared the Guidelines for School-Home Partnership with parents on fostering positive school-home partnerships. This is in recognition of the need for parents and teachers to work closely together to support the children's holistic development. The guidelines also provide greater consistency of practice within and across schools. Parents have been supportive of these guidelines. On rare occasions when parents use abusive words or threaten teachers, they can inform their School Leaders or MOE, who will follow up with the parents. Where a teacher's safety is threatened, MOE and the school will support the teacher in making a police report. Counselling support from MOE will also be extended to the affected teachers where required.  "
supply of doctors in singapore and percentage of local versus foreign doctors,Mr Seah Kian Peng asked the Minister for Health (a) whether there is an oversupply of doctors in Singapore; and (b) what percentage of doctors in Singapore are currently non-Singaporeans and whether there is a specific target that the Ministry is working towards.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: To meet our healthcare needs, the Ministry of Health (MOH) regularly reviews our medical manpower supply and demand, taking into account population demographics and disease trends. In 2018, there were around 14,000 registered doctors in Singapore. This translates to a ratio of 2.4 doctors per 1,000 population, which is comparable to developed countries such as Japan, USA and UK. With the increase in capacity of our local medical schools in the past few years, as well as more Singaporean doctors returning from overseas education, the proportion of local doctors in our healthcare system increased from 82% in 2012 to 90% in 2018. We expect the proportion of local doctors to increase further with a steady inflow from local and overseas medical schools. As we transform our healthcare model, our manpower needs will change and we will need to regularly review and adjust our manpower plans.           "
"singapore's efforts to address climate change, prioritise sustainable living and reduce food waste",Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources what steps is Singapore taking to (i) address climate change (ii) prioritise green and sustainable living and (iii) reduce food waste in Singapore.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: A clean, green and liveable environment is necessary for Singaporeans to lead healthy lives. We pursue sustainable development by taking a long-term and integrated approach to planning and implementation. The Sustainable Singapore Blueprint (SSB) charts out the measures and targets to support sustainable development. These include planning for parks and green spaces in housing estates, enhancing public transport, and introducing eco-friendly features in HDB flats, such as rooftop greenery, solar panels, dual chutes for recycling and smart metering. These features are being implemented progressively, and will also be incorporated in new sustainable districts such as Punggol Digital District, Jurong Lake District and Tengah Estate. The Sustainable Singapore Blueprint goes beyond hardware to also cover ""heartware"". My Ministry works closely with other Government agencies and community partners on ground-up initiatives that help make Singapore an endearing and liveable home. Residents can participate in environmental programmes such as litter picking, recycling, and energy and water conservation activities.However, our sustainable development journey is not without challenges. Climate change is a key existential threat for Singapore and we are taking concerted action to tackle it. To meet our Paris Agreement goals, we have a suite of measures to reduce greenhouse gases across all sectors of the economy. This includes incentivising the adoption of energy efficient technologies and cleaner forms of energy. We also implemented a carbon tax this year to further our transition towards a low-carbon economy.To provide a sound scientific basis for planning and climate adaptation, we established the Centre for Climate Research Singapore in 2013. We are also taking steps to protect Singapore against climate change impacts. For example, we have invested in technologies such as NEWater and desalination, as well as in new drainage infrastructure to strengthen our water supply and flood resilience.But we cannot combat climate change through the efforts of the Government alone. That is why Singapore designated 2018 the Year of Climate Action to encourage collective climate action in the community. To date, more than 340,000 individuals, organisations and institutions have pledged to reduce their carbon footprint.The production and consumption of goods account for the bulk of global greenhouse gas emissions. It is therefore critical that we produce and consume sustainably, and strive towards a zero-waste nation.We designated 2019 the Year Towards Zero Waste to galvanise the public and stakeholders to practise the 3Rs, and adopt circular economy approaches that keep resources in use for as long as possible. We will launch the inaugural Zero Waste Masterplan this year, which outlines our strategies to tackle the priority waste streams of e-waste, food waste and packaging waste, supported by R&D and industry development.  A combination of measures is used to tackle packaging waste and e-waste, including public campaigns, voluntary agreements and regulatory requirements on producers. We recently launched the ""Say YES to Waste Less"" campaign with 59 partners across more than 1,600 outlets, to encourage consumers to use reusables such as reusable bags and reduce the use of disposables. To reduce food waste, our approach includes raising awareness of food waste reduction, and promoting excess food redistribution. Since 2015, the National Environment Agency (NEA) has been running a food waste reduction campaign to encourage everyone to ""Buy, Order or Cook Just Enough"". Educational materials such as the Food Waste Reduction Handy Guide are shared online and at road shows. We also work with interest groups and NGOs such as Food Bank Singapore and Food from the Heart to increase awareness and drive action in the community. We have developed food waste minimisation guidebooks for food retail establishments, supermarkets and food manufacturing establishments, which guide owners and operators of food and beverage businesses to implement measures to reduce food waste across the supply chain. Guidelines on the proper handling and redistribution of unsold or excess food are incorporated to facilitate food redistribution.I urge everyone to play our part in making green and sustainable lifestyle choices, so as to reduce our carbon footprint and strive towards a zero waste nation."
"definition of ""disability"" for social policies","Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what is the official definition of ""disability"" used in our social policies; (b) how does this definition compare to the definition under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments); (c) when was our definition stipulated, and whether it is time for a review; and (d) what is the reason for mental disorders to be excluded from this definition of disability for social support and employment schemes.","Mr Desmond Lee: The Enabling Masterplans define ""persons with disability"" as those with substantially reduced prospects of securing, retaining places and advancing in education and training institutions, employment and recreation, due to physical, intellectual, and sensory impairments, as well as developmental needs including Autism Spectrum Disorder. This definition was endorsed in 2004 by the first Enabling Masterplan Steering Committee, comprising representatives1 of the disability sector, the private sector and the public sector. Our disability schemes and services are guided by this definition.In determining if an individual's conditions fall within the disability criteria, medical assessments and examinations of the socio-functional limitations faced by persons with disability are done by medical professionals or suitable non-medical professionals such as therapists. The Steering Committee in 2004 assessed that the medical diagnosis ensured rigour in determining what constituted a disability, while the socio-functional examination ensured that economic, environmental and cultural barriers were also taken into account. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities does not explicitly define which conditions constitute a disability, but notes that persons with disability include those who have long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others.  In line with the Convention, disability schemes and services in Singapore are designed to facilitate the participation of individuals with hearing impairment and visual impairment conditions, physical disabilities, intellectual disabilities, Autism Spectrum Disorder – a type of mental disorder, as well as children with developmental needs, in areas such as education, transport, employment, training, recreation and care, such that they are recognised, empowered and given every opportunity to be integral and contributing members of society.  Disability schemes and services do not comprehensively target individuals with mental health conditions as the Government's support for this group is focused on their recovery and reintegration into society. The Government has adopted a comprehensive and multi-pronged approach in this regard. Through the National Mental Health Blueprint and the Community Mental Health Masterplan, the Ministry of Health has enhanced mental health promotion and upstream prevention; improved early detection, intervention, and disease management; and adopted a collective front to better integrate health, social and community support. Jobseekers with mental health conditions who require employment assistance can approach the Job Club under the Institute of Mental Health, as well as the Singapore Anglican Community Services’ Employment Support Services. They can also tap on the employment support programmes under Workforce Singapore's Adapt and Grow initiative. The Institute of Mental Health and NCSS have also developed a Peer Support Specialist programme where persons in recovery can be trained and employed as Peer Support Specialists to provide support to other persons with mental health conditions. In addition, the Health Promotion Board provides management training workshops that equip managers and HR personnel with the skills to foster a supportive workplace environment, recognise common mental health issues, and encourage help-seeking behaviour. While our current policies and definitions have served us well thus far, the Government will continue to review the reach and efficacy of our policies and services as we work with the disability sector to strengthen support for persons with disability under the Enabling Masterplan. "
inflation in premiums for private hospitalisation insurance plans,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Health (a) for the past five years, what has been the trend in premium inflation for private hospitalisation insurance plans; and (b) what measures have been taken to regulate over-charging and over-consumption in the private medical sector.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Over the last five years, premiums of the private insurance component of private hospital Integrated Shield Plans (IP) have increased by an average of 7% per year. The increases have been more pronounced in recent years, especially for IP riders which typically have zero co-payment. Between 2016 and 2019, premiums of riders and the private insurance component of IP rose by an average of 24% and 10% respectively each year. These trends are largely reflective of increases in private hospital insurance claims.Such increases in claims and premiums are not sustainable in the long term. MOH has thus introduced a range of initiatives to address concerns over over-charging and over-consumption of private healthcare services, while ensuring that patients continue to have access to good quality and appropriate healthcare. The initiatives are aimed at encouraging doctors and providers to prescribe and charge appropriately, helping patients to make more informed and appropriate decisions and guiding insurers to have more suitable healthcare insurance design.Doctors and healthcare professionals should make recommendations and decisions on care options that are both clinically-effective and cost-effective. To help them, MOH's Agency of Care Effectiveness has been issuing appropriate care and drug guidances since 2017.In November 2018, MOH started publishing fee benchmarks for private sector professional fees. These will guide appropriate charging among healthcare providers, and enable patients and payers to make better informed decisions.  Co-payment is an important healthcare financing design feature to ensure that all stakeholders have a stake in their healthcare decisions. In March 2018, MOH announced the requirement for minimum co-payment for new IP riders. From April 2019, new IP riders must incorporate a co-payment. Insurers are also improving their claims management measures with the use of panels and pre-authorisation processes, and stepping up their claims scrutiny over questionable charges. Ensuring affordable and sustainable healthcare and healthcare insurance will require each stakeholder – doctors and healthcare providers, patients, insurers and government – to play a part."
preventing singapore residential properties from being leased on websites like airbnb,Mr Chong Kee Hiong asked the Minister for National Development regarding listings of Singapore residential properties for lease periods shorter than the legally permitted durations on websites such as Airbnb (a) what measures are in place to prevent such listings; (b) how rigorous are the enforcement measures; (c) whether penalties should be increased; and (d) whether the Ministry will consider penalties for websites which host such illegal listings including temporary bans.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The listings on websites like Airbnb typically do not contain specific information on the property and its owner, or the terms of the rental arrangement. So, the key to effective enforcement against illegal short-term accommodation (STA) is not so much by targeting the listings, but by conducting investigations against all suspected cases and taking action against the STA hosts. Over the past year, URA has been stepping up its investigations of residential units suspected of STA use. Where there is evidence of illegal STA operations, URA will take enforcement action and impose penalties on the perpetrators. For those renting out their homes on a casual basis, and caught for the first time, URA will impose a composition fine, of up to $5,000. Since May 2019, URA has issued seven such fines. For repeat offenders and those who undertake STA operations on a commercial scale, URA will prosecute them in court, and seek higher penalties. So far, URA has secured four convictions in Court. With the increase in investigation and enforcement actions, we can expect more cases to be fined and prosecuted in Court over the coming months. There have been a few cases of estate agents who were complicit in illegal STA activities. Besides the financial penalties imposed by URA or the Courts, the CEA will separately bring these errant agents to task by revoking their registration and debarring them for a period of time.  "
additional measures to tackle pigeon nuisance,"Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether the pigeon nuisance at the housing estates has worsened; (b) whether the additional measures taken by NParks and NEA to step up surveillance, education and enforcement have been effective in reducing pigeon feeding; and (c) whether there is a need for a concerted multi-agency effort to significantly reduce pigeon feeding.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Pigeons, like other birds, are attracted to places where food is easily available. NParks has been working closely with Government agencies and Town Councils on measures to reduce pigeon feeding, which can attract pigeons and cause them to breed quickly. For instance, NParks monitors pigeon feeding hotspots and works with the Town Councils to carry out targeted enforcement operations. NParks also raises public awareness against pigeon feeding via advisories, posters and outreach events. NEA works with food centres and coffee shops in HDB estates to ensure proper food waste management and to enforce against littering.To address pigeon feeding issues comprehensively, we need concerted efforts not just by government agencies and Town Councils, but also grassroots leaders and residents. One good example is the High-Rise Littering Pigeon Feeding pilot programme in Yio Chu Kang last year. This involved not only multiple government agencies, but also grassroots leaders who played an integral role in persuading potential pigeon feeders to change their behaviour, and encouraging residents to help educate the local community. The pilot demonstrated how an active and engaged community can help to deliver positive outcomes.Agencies are studying how the insights gained from the pilot can be scaled up, starting with the development of more targeted public education messages and materials to change the behaviour of pigeon feeders. "
improvement of service standard of singpost,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) whether he can provide an update on the current standard of service by SingPost; and (b) whether there have been visible signs of improvement over the past six months.,"Mr S Iswaran: My Ministry and the Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA) have been working closely with SingPost to improve its operations and service delivery. In February 2019, SingPost announced immediate measures to improve service quality, such as extending delivery hours to Saturdays, hiring more postmen, and reducing delivery of non-core services such as advertisement mail.SingPost recently announced further plans to improve its service delivery. These include increasing the number of postmen to better manage their load, having dedicated teams to conduct doorstep deliveries to improve efficiency, and extending doorstep delivery to evening hours to increase their success rate. SingPost will invest in technology and automation to increase the efficiency of postal processes and support its postmen better. There are early signs of improvement. SingPost has seen a 30% drop in the number of letter and parcel delivery complaints in May 2019 compared to April 2019. Across post offices, SingPost has also observed an improvement in customers' satisfaction with its customer experience score improving from 8.2 in December 2018 to 8.8 (on a 10-point scale) in May 2019. While SingPost's efforts to address its service delivery issues are in the right direction, these would need to be sustained. My Ministry and IMDA will continue to hold SingPost accountable for delivery, even as we work with them on longer term improvements, such as enhancing our postal infrastructure.  "
accidents involving cyclists and pmd users at bus stops,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Transport (a) how many accidents have there been over the last one year involving cyclists and PMD users at bus stops; (b) how can the Ministry better protect commuters at bus stops; and (c) what are the efforts to improve safer usage of bicycles and PMDs at bus stops.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: In the past year, there were 18 reported accidents involving cyclists and personal mobility device (PMD) users at or near bus stops. LTA has been progressively undertaking infrastructural improvements at bus stops to improve safety, by building cycling paths and widening footpaths behind bus stops with high commuter traffic. The aim is to allow cyclists and PMD users to go behind the bus stop rather than through it. The widened paths include additional safety features, such as speed regulating strips, ""Look"" and ""Slow"" markings and ""Give Way to Pedestrians"" signs. LTA will continue with these infrastructural improvements where possible.In addition, LTA regularly highlights safe riding practices in its nationwide public education campaigns. These include reminders to: ""always give way to pedestrians"", ""slow down when approaching bus stops"" and ""walk your device in crowded areas"". To date, more than 46,000 individuals have attended the Safe Riding Programme, which teaches riders to slow down, walk their devices, or dismount and push their devices at bus stops, amongst other safe riding habits.                       "
approval to operate commercial shared pmd services,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether any company has been approved to operate commercial shared PMD services on public footpaths and public parks; (b) if so, when did this take place and which companies have been awarded; (c) if not, when are approvals expected; and (d) whether an update can be provided on the latest conditions and restrictions which have been imposed or which the LTA intends to impose in respect of the operation of commercial shared PMD services by proposed operators.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The award of PMD-sharing licences has been deferred to later this year as the Land Transport Authority (LTA) requires more time to review the imposition of additional requirements on licensees to ensure the safety of users and the general public. The requirements being considered include requiring shared PMDs to be certified to the UL2272 standard to ensure fire safety, and to be insured against third-party claims on bodily injury or death. LTA will also start conservatively, restricting sandbox licensees to small fleet sizes over a 1-year sandbox period."
managing fumes and odour from converted eateries in residential areas,"Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for National Development in respect of the conversion of shops to eateries at shopping malls, whether URA will consider introducing an approval system to address potential problems dealing with fumes and odour that may emanate from the converted eateries to nearby residential areas and to impose quantifiable odour and fume standards for all eateries to observe.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Shopping malls are sited on land zoned by URA for commercial use. Restaurants, including eating houses, cafés, and food courts, are an allowable commercial use in shopping malls.  There are currently no established standards or limits for food-related odours. Nevertheless, to minimise dis-amenities caused by the discharge of fumes and odours, developers and managing agents of premises with eateries and individual eateries are required by NEA and SFA to install exhaust systems with air cleaning functions. They are also required to direct their exhaust outlets away from neighbouring premises as much as possible, and ensure that their exhaust systems are kept clean and properly maintained.                                    "
terms of operations for virtual banks,Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked the Prime Minister (a) what are the operating terms for virtual banks as compared with traditional banks; (b) whether MAS will ensure that there is a level playing field for all; and (c) what is the impact of lower operational costs for virtual banks on consumers and the industry.,"Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): MAS has announced that it will be issuing up to five new digital bank licences, which will comprise up to two digital full bank licences that can access retail deposits, and up to three digital wholesale bank licences that will cater to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and other non-retail segments. This is in addition to any digital banks that Singapore banking groups may establish under MAS' existing internet banking framework introduced in 2000. The move will provide space in our banking system for innovative non-bank players, and help spur further innovation in banking. In the same vein, MAS had announced in September last year that non-bank payment institutions will be granted direct access to the real time payments network between banks, also known as Fast and Secure Transfer (FAST). MAS' operating terms for the new digital banks will be calibrated to maintain the trust and stability that are the hallmarks of Singapore's banking system. Let me elaborate.First, MAS will carefully evaluate the sustainability of applicants' business models. They must not engage in value-destructive competition to gain market share. MAS will monitor market dynamics and, where necessary, impose additional supervisory requirements or restrictions to deter such behaviour. The aim here is to avoid unsustainable banking practices, and to preserve a level playing field among banks. Second, we will also preserve a level playing field in prudential requirements. The digital banks will have to meet the same capital and liquidity requirements as existing banks. They will be subject to the same consumer lending rules, such as limits on unsecured credit extended and loan-to-value ratios for mortgages. Digital full banks will also be required to participate in the deposit insurance scheme, which will cover an individual’s deposits of up to S$75,000.Third, to minimise risks to retail depositors, MAS will phase in the permissible activities of digital full banks via a two-stage process. A digital full bank will commence as a restricted digital bank to build up its business model and internal processes, and gradually progress to become a full-fledged full bank. At the entry stage, a restricted bank will be subject to an aggregate deposit cap of S$50 million and an individual depositor cap of S$75,000. While digital wholesale banks are not subject to the two-stage process, MAS will impose appropriate activity restrictions in its initial years of operations to mitigate the risks of untested business models.  MAS' regulatory and supervisory frameworks support the stability of the system as a whole, and help preserve sound practices among individual banks. But MAS, like all financial regulators, cannot guarantee that individual banks will not fail, whether they are digital banks or otherwise. It hence remains important for consumers to be aware of the risks, and of the extent of protection that they will be accorded under the deposit insurance scheme if a bank fails. Mr Saktiandi asked about the impact of digital banks' operational costs on consumers. Digital banks are likely to operate with new technology stacks and may have more nimble solutions that enable lower operational costs than traditional banks. This can potentially benefit customers and the broader economy. New digital banks could potentially offer deposit accounts without imposing any minimum deposit amount or fall-below fees, as seen in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong.Digital banks with access to more wide-ranging data sources could adopt different credit risk assessment approaches to lend to under-served segments of the economy like young and micro enterprises.Further, the increased competition from digital banks is likely to spur existing banks to improve further on their own digital offerings.We are confident that the calibrated opening of banking to new digital players will benefit consumers and businesses, while preserving stability. It should ensure that Singapore's banking sector continues to be resilient, competitive and vibrant."
assistance to elderly homeowners who may have difficulty checking areas in their homes for mosquitoes to prevent spread of dengue,"Mr Chong Kee Hiong asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources in view of the recent dengue situation, what assistance measures can be offered to home owners, especially the elderly, who are unable to check on areas beyond their reach such as gutters.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: As of 29 June, there were over 6,100 reported dengue cases in 2019, which is about four times the number of cases in the same period in 2018. We are entering the traditional peak dengue season and a national collective effort is critical to stem the transmission of dengue. Inspections conducted by the National Environment Agency (NEA) showed that 60% of all Aedes aegypti breeding habitats detected were in homes. This proportion was even higher in dengue clusters, with 74% of breeding habitats detected in homes. Therefore, home-owners play a crucial role in keeping dengue at bay. I urge all residents to take immediate action to eradicate potential mosquito breeding habitats by practicing the 5-step Mozzie Wipeout regularly, and stepping up housekeeping measures. All residents living in cluster areas should also cooperate with NEA officers to facilitate checks and carry out indoor misting in homes. Community support is an integral part of the national effort to raise awareness and drive action on the ground. NEA, together with Dengue Prevention Volunteers, works closely with Grassroots Advisers, Neighbourhood Committees (NCs) and Residents’ Committees (RCs) to reach out to residents. NCs and RCs can assist households with elderly members to check their homes and remove stagnant water to prevent mosquito breeding. Households can take preventive measures such as avoiding the use of flowerpot plates for ornamental plants. Home owners with roof gutters that are difficult to access can engage pest control operators to check for stagnant water and apply Bti insecticide, if they are unable to do so themselves. A typical Bti briquette can remain effective for about 30 days. NEA is stepping up efforts to stem dengue transmission. Over 440 dengue prevention events have been organised since the launch of this year's National Dengue Prevention Campaign in April. However, the government alone cannot prevent dengue transmission in Singapore. I encourage everyone, including our silver generation, to be an advocate of dengue prevention and to remind our family members and neighbours to join in this national effort.           "
cause of substation fire at carlton hotel,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what is the cause of the SP Power Grid (SPPG) Substation fire at the Carlton Hotel in February 2019; (b) what is the result of the investigation into the SPPG Substation fire at Bright Hill in January 2019; (c) whether any equipment at fault in these incidents is scheduled for replacement or maintenance; and (d) what measures have been taken to address the risk of recurrence.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: Based on EMA's investigations, the power failure at the Carlton Hotel on 14 February 2019 was due to a short circuit in the substation switchgear, which started a fire. The insulation between two components in the switchgear had failed due to heat stress from foreign contaminants, which could have been introduced during maintenance. EMA determined that had SP Power Grid (SPPG) complied with its standard operating procedure (SOP) for monitoring work, the incident could have been prevented. As a result, EMA imposed a financial penalty of $1,000,000 on SPPG.As for the power failure at Bright Hill that occurred on 26 January 2019, EMA's investigations showed that a faulty voltage transformer (VT) had started a fire in the substation. EMA found that SPPG was using the faulty VT beyond its Original Equipment Manufacturer's (OEM) recommended lifespan. Thus, EMA imposed a financial penalty of $750,000 on SPPG. SPPG is replacing all the VTs that have exceeded their lifespan, starting with those of a similar make and model as the faulty VT in Bright Hill. EMA has also worked with SPPG to place such equipment within a protection zone where, in the event of failure, the impact will be isolated to minimise the risk of a cascading effect affecting other substations.The Government takes a serious view of ensuring that our power system remains reliable and secure. EMA has also stepped up its regulatory oversight on how SPPG monitors and maintains the health of our power system.  Separately, SPPG has engaged an independent consultant to review and recommend enhancements to its equipment replacement and maintenance regime, as well as its monitoring work practices. As a result, SPPG is putting more resources into monitoring and maintaining substations and renewing key assets. They will also extend the use of technologies such as online condition monitoring and deepen the core skills of their workforce. EMA will continue to work closely with SPPG to ensure a high standard of reliability for our power system.  "
sufficient workers involved in preventive maintenance of mrt lines,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether there are sufficient workers currently at the two rail operators to carry out preventive maintenance of the MRT lines effectively; and (b) what are the plans by the Ministry to ensure that there are adequate skilled technical workers for rail maintenance in view of the introduction and opening of new MRT lines.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Effective and timely maintenance is necessary to ensure a reliable MRT service. Besides hardware investments, we also require a skilled maintenance workforce. Today, our rail operators deploy more than 50% of their headcount, or more than 4,000 staff, to maintenance and engineering. Thanks to their tireless efforts, our MRT service has stabilised, with a reliability level comparable to that of Taipei Metro and Hong Kong MTR. We need to maintain this staffing level for existing MRT lines. But as our MRT network is still expanding, we work closely with the rail operators and the National Transport Workers' Union (NTWU), to continuously upskill and reskill existing workers, and to attract a healthy pipeline of new workers.In 2016, LTA launched the $12.5 million Public Transport Manpower Development Fund, or PTMDF in short, to attract, develop, and retain skilled workers in the public transport industry. Under the PTMDF, we introduced Rail Industry Training Grants to co-fund courses for rail technicians and engineers. The PTMDF also co-funds the Public Transport Study Awards offered to prospective ITE, polytechnic, and university students keen to embark on a technical career with the rail operators. In addition, we also collaborate with Workforce Singapore and SkillsFuture Singapore on wider initiatives to enhance the capabilities of public transport workers. This includes the Skills Framework for Public Transport to define a career development roadmap and support competency-based training for public transport workers. Together with Workforce Singapore, we also offer Professional Conversion Programmes to help mid-career workers make the switch into the public transport industry.  We will continue to engage the stakeholders to see how we can further deepen and widen efforts in this area.         "
complaints of foreign tenants in hdb estates,"Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for National Development (a) over the last five years, what is the number of complaints received by HDB pertaining to foreign tenants in HDB estates; (b) what is the nature of these complaints; (c) how does HDB follow up on the complaints; and (d) whether measures are in place to help first-time foreign tenants of HDB flats familiarise with the norms and practices in HDB estates as well as living in Singapore.","Mr Lawrence Wong: From 2014 to 2018, HDB received about 3,300 cases of feedback on suspected unauthorised flat rentals, dis-amenities or overcrowding of HDB flats by foreign and non-foreign tenants. HDB investigates every case of public feedback received, on top of the proactive inspections that it carries out. Depending on the severity and circumstances of the infringement, HDB may issue a written warning, impose a financial penalty, or acquire the flats compulsorily from the owners.HDB actively promotes gracious and harmonious living in public housing through various initiatives. For example, HDB has a network of volunteers to help spread tips on neighbourliness at community events and door-to-door visits. HDB also gives out the Good Neighbour Awards to recognise individuals who have gone the extra mile with their acts of neighbourliness.Besides HDB's efforts, there are also initiatives undertaken by other Government agencies. For example, the People's Association's nationwide network of more than 1,400 Integration and Naturalisation Champions reach out to new immigrants and help them settle into the community. The National Integration Council works with community groups, immigrant associations, schools, and other partners to help foreigners and immigrants understand our local laws, norms and culture."
further attempts for bus-on-demand trial,Prof Lim Sun Sun asked the Minister for Transport in view of the discontinuation of the bus-on-demand trial due to high software development costs and poor commuter take-up (a) whether options to lower such costs have been explored through opening up software development to more players; and (b) whether a more concerted effort to educate commuters could be made before concluding the trial.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The six-month on-demand public bus or ODPB trial was concluded last month. It has achieved its objective of providing insights on resource requirements and commuter acceptance. We found the ODPB to be less cost effective than regular bus services. One factor was the high software development costs. This is so even though the open tender attracted competitive bids from ten local and overseas players. As with all new technologies, public acceptance takes time and effort. LTA worked with both the ODPB operators and software developers to raise awareness among commuters in the trial areas. Posters were put up at major public transport nodes, and ground ambassadors were deployed to offer assistance to commuters. LTA also engaged stakeholders directly served by the ODPB services. While some commuters were initially uncomfortable with booking a bus ride using mobile phones, many gave it a try with more than 29,000 rides booked and taken. LTA is open to conducting further trials of the on-demand concept in future. As the technology matures, we can expect the large-scale deployment of ODPB to be more cost effective. We will also build on these initial engagement efforts to educate commuters on the concept.  "
checks in water meters to ensure absence of leakage,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether PUB conducts regular checks on water meters of residents' homes to ensure that there is no leakage; and (b) what is the follow-up process when residents suspect that their water meters may be faulty.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Water fixtures and fittings, such as pipes and water taps, undergo natural wear and tear and require periodic repair and maintenance. It is the responsibility of home owners to maintain these fixtures and fittings, to ensure that there is no water leakage within their homes. Water meter readings are taken by SP Services, PUB's billing agent, once every two months. If SP Services detects exceptionally high or low usage, SP Services and PUB will carry out checks and investigations. If the meter is faulty, PUB will replace the meter. If the leak is suspected to involve home water fixtures and fittings, PUB will alert the home owner to look into it. Residents who suspect leaks in their homes can turn off all the taps in the house and check their water meters. If the water meter counter dial is still running, there may be a leak in the home. The resident should then engage a licensed plumber to trace and repair the leak. Residents can also contact SP Services to request for the meter to be checked By 2023, PUB will install 300,000 smart water meters in new and existing premises through the first phase of its Smart Water Meter Programme. Once rolled out, residents with smart meters will have ready access to their daily water usage data through a mobile application or an online portal, and be promptly alerted to suspected leaks."
number of visitors at changi airport's jewel and reported injuries there,"Mr Ang Wei Neng asked the Minister for Transport (a) how many visitors, locals and foreigners, have visited Jewel since its opening; (b) how many injury cases have been reported at the Jewel; and (c) what are the steps that the Ministry has taken to improve its safety measures.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: More than 24 million visitors have visited Jewel Changi Airport since it opened to the public on 11 April 2019.There have been nine reported incidents with injuries at Jewel. Five were escalator-related which the Building and Construction Authority has investigated. They found no technical safety issues and the incidents were due to unsafe user behaviour, such as brushing footwear against the side of an escalator. Four incidents took place at the Jewel Canopy Park. Investigations by Jewel Changi Airport confirmed that the incidents were not caused by technical problems.Meanwhile, Jewel Changi Airport is taking steps to improve safety. It is installing additional signages to remind visitors to exercise care. Jewel Hosts stationed at the attractions will also be extra vigilant in looking out for unsafe behaviours.        "
proposal for house unions in ministries and statutory boards to be regarded as part of organisational structure,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Prime Minister whether house unions in the various Ministries and statutory boards can be regarded as part of the organisational structure and hence be allowed to occupy office space within the building premises without being charged market rental.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing (for the Prime Minister): House unions are valued partners of public sector agencies, but are not part of the organisational structure. They are separate entities regulated by the Trade Unions Act and other legislation administered by the Registry of Trade Unions. In general, public sector agencies allow their union branch leaders to use their non-exclusive office facilities, such as meeting rooms, without any charges. They are accorded the same treatment as any other employees who need to use the office facilities. However, in instances where the unions have requested for dedicated office space for their exclusive use, they would be charged market rental rates. This is in line with the Ministry of Finance's policy that all government premises should be rented at market rates.   "
number of displaced persons in shelters,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what is the total number of shelters in Singapore in 2016, 2017 and 2018; (b) how many residents in total are in transit within these shelters in 2016, 2017 and 2018; (c) how many of these are displaced families; (d) how many are foreigners; (e) what are the reasons cited for their displacement; and (f) how many displaced does the Ministry estimate to be on the streets in 2016, 2017 and 2018.","Mr Desmond Lee: MSF works closely with Government and community agencies, such as HDB and social service agencies, to assist homeless families and individuals in need. Some had sold their flats due to debt or divorce before becoming homeless. Others may have homes but are unable to return to them for various reasons, such as conflict with their family members or co-tenants. There are also individuals who are unable to work and have no means of support.Families and individuals who have homes but who are not able to return to them are referred to MSF-funded Transitional Shelters. These shelters provide temporary accommodation, while social workers work with the families and individuals to address underlying social issues and secure long-term housing arrangements. For individuals who are unable to support themselves and have limited or no family support, long-term residential care and support are provided by our Welfare Homes. These homes help to meet residents’ basic needs, as well as help them improve their emotional and physical well-being through rehabilitation programmes.Those who are homeless because they experienced family violence at their homes and need a safe place away from the abuse are referred to MSF-funded Crisis Shelters for temporary safe accommodation. Social workers will work with them to address their safety issues and provide them with counselling and other services.There are currently three Transitional Shelters and 11 Welfare Homes serving vulnerable groups operated by Voluntary Welfare Organisations with MSF funding. Between 2016 and 2018, MSF provided assistance and support to an average of about 290 individuals per year who were homeless, destitute or sleeping in public places. There are currently four Crisis Shelters, which assisted 190 family violence cases on average each year over the same period. There was an average of about 180 families in the transitional shelters and crisis shelters in each of the three years. Each year, these shelters also assisted an average of about 60 cases comprising foreigners who sought help on their own or were part of a transnational household."
oversight of payment services firms that promote a selected e-currency proprietary token,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Prime Minister (a) whether MAS is monitoring payment services firms which promote as e-currency proprietary tokens which are purchased with Singapore dollars but are not linked to Singapore dollars at a fixed rate and are not convertible to funds in a Singapore bank account on demand; (b) whether these firms are compliant with the Payment Services Act and other applicable laws; and (c) what measures MAS will take to address any risks to customers, merchants or the financial system.","Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): In January this year, the Payment Services Act (the ""Act"") was passed in Parliament. It will strengthen MAS’ regulation of payment service providers, while facilitating innovation in this area. Firms that provide any payment service as a business in Singapore, including issuance of e-money and sale of digital payment tokens, will be regulated under the Act when it comes into effect later this year.The Act draws a distinction between e-money and digital payment tokens (DPTs), both of which can be used for payments. E-money is denominated in or pegged by the issuer to a national currency, whereas DPTs are not. A typical example of e-money is the value held in EZ-link cards. A major payment institution that issues such e-money will be required to safeguard customer monies, through measures, such as keeping them in a segregated bank account. So, customers here are not exposed to undue risks.Assoc Prof Theseira is likely referring to DPTs rather than e-money. Firms that sell such DPTs must be licensed under the Act. MAS’ key regulatory intent with respect to DPTs is to address money laundering and terrorism financing risks which arise from the anonymity, speed and cross-border nature of DPT transactions.The Act does not provide customers of DPTs the same level of regulatory protection as for e-money. For example, the monies that they pay in exchange for DPTs are not required to be safeguarded in a segregated bank account. It is, therefore, important for members of the public to understand that by adopting DPTs as a form of payment, they are exposed to the risk of the DPTs losing their value.MAS has adopted this approach because DPT services are at a nascent stage of development and far from gaining mainstream adoption. Prematurely regulating these services for consumer protection may have a legitimising effect which can spur their acceptance and popularity, which we want to avoid.Hence, MAS will require DPT service providers to make appropriate disclosures, including stating clearly to their customers, both individuals and merchants, that the product purchased is a DPT and is not subject to safeguarding protection under the Act.MAS will be consulting the public on the proposed disclosure requirements in the coming months. In the meantime, MAS will continue to work with the media to highlight the risks of purchasing DPTs, including issuing advisories to warn the public of the risks. MAS is monitoring developments in this area closely to ensure that our regulatory framework remains relevant and effective."
different income ceilings for different help schemes,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) in addressing inequality and social mobility which are inter-agency issues, what is the reason for the difference in income ceilings for ComCare Assistance ($1,900/$650 per capita), the Public Rental Scheme ($1,500), the Workfare Income Supplement ($2,300) and the financial assistance scheme for education ($2,750/$690 per capita); (b) how are these different ceilings derived; and (c) what is the minimum cost of living that is used as a guide for our social policies.","Mr Desmond Lee: Our social assistance schemes meet different needs and have different target groups. ComCare supports basic living expenses. The Public Rental Scheme provides highly-subsidised rental housing. The Workfare Income Supplement Scheme tops up the incomes and CPF savings of lower wage workers to incentivise employment and retirement savings. The MOE Financial Assistance Scheme supports the schooling expenses of children from lower income families.Agencies incorporate data and information from multiple sources when formulating these schemes and design the eligibility criteria taking into account not just income but also other factors relevant to the particular scheme. For example, ComCare Long-Term Assistance considers whether a person is unable to work due to old age, illness or disability and has little or no family support. Flexibility is also exercised when applying the criteria. For example, HDB exercises flexibility to allow those with household incomes above $1,500 to live in public rental housing based on their circumstances.The different criteria for different schemes also reflect our policy priorities. For example, education subsidies tend to be set higher – both in their income ceiling and subsidy quantum – because we strongly believe in the importance of education in opening doors to opportunity, addressing inequality and uplifting social mobility.There is another advantage of having eligibility criteria separately tailored to the different schemes. This way, we avoid creating a single critical income threshold, which when crossed causes families to simultaneously fall out of all the assistance schemes. Such a cliff effect would strongly disincentivise families to upgrade themselves and rise out of poverty.Together, the various assistance schemes form a social safety net that provides help to Singaporeans in need and more help to those who need it more. To further strengthen social service delivery, MSF is spearheading a whole-of-Government effort to ensure that support is comprehensive, convenient and coordinated. For example, we have been streamlining assessment protocols. ComCare clients will be automatically assessed for MOE financial assistance and HDB public rental rates. We will expand this arrangement progressively to cover more schemes and agencies. Social assistance schemes and criteria are also continually reviewed to ensure that their objectives are being met."
impact to singapore from development of ship-to-ship transfer hub at johor’s tanjung pelepas port,Mr Ang Wei Neng asked the Minister for Transport whether the development of Malaysia's ship-to-ship transfer hub at Johor's Tanjung Pelepas Port has (i) encroached on the sovereignty of Singapore waters and (ii) made a significant impact on the economics of Singapore port operations.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Singapore has asked for and is awaiting information from Malaysia on its plans to develop a ship-to-ship transfer hub in the Straits of Johor, including on its precise location. The project must not encroach into Singapore’s Territorial Waters.The project appears to be about the storage and trading of petroleum products, including fuel oil; it does not seem to be about container port operations. But we will need to assess the project’s implications on safety of navigation in the area and its potential trans-boundary environmental impact. We can only have a better assessment after Malaysia has provided the relevant information. "
potential job creation in electric cars industry,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Trade and Industry in view of the growing inflow of investments to build electric cars and auxiliary technology in Singapore (a) how many jobs can this new industry provide; and (b) how can Singaporeans better prepare to take on these jobs.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: Attracting investments to build electric cars is part of our larger strategy to develop a smart mobility ecosystem in Singapore. This ecosystem includes hardware such as highly automated vehicle assembly and automotive component manufacturing as well as software such as smart mobility platforms. This in turn will create many more new jobs. For instance, Dyson’s new automotive manufacturing facility in Singapore will require more engineers. Grab’s new R&D centre at one-north can house 3,000 employees. A vibrant smart mobility ecosystem will not only create new jobs but also benefit adjacent industries which we have already established here. Our semiconductor companies, such as STMicroelectronics will see increased demand for high-value automotive electronics including sensors, processors, communication and power electronics. Our ICT companies, such as Singtel will benefit from the demand in secured and reliable communications systems. Our financial institutions can also develop new financial or insurance products for the mobility businesses. Smart mobility is a rapidly evolving industry. While we cannot provide exact numbers now, MTI is confident that the whole ecosystem including the supporting industries will create many diverse and exciting jobs. Government agencies will continue to work with companies, training providers and the unions to prepare Singaporeans to take on these jobs. For instance, for manufacturing-related jobs, we have been supporting workers to learn and adopt Industry 4.0 technologies. To grow a pipeline of software engineers who can develop mobility solutions, we have also been supporting various AI and data analytics training programmes. I encourage Singaporeans to take advantage of these training opportunities to upgrade their skills and prepare themselves for these new opportunities.                "
fires involving conserved heritage buildings,"Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) over the past three years, how many fires have there been involving our conserved or heritage buildings; (b) how does the Ministry ensure that there is adequate protection for such older structures; and (c) what are the measures in place to ensure that renovation or alterations made to such structures are carried out safely and properly supervised.","Mr K Shanmugam:  The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) responded to 104 fires involving conserved buildings from 2016 to 2018.When existing buildings, including conserved buildings undergo upgrading works they must comply with the requirements in the prevailing Fire Code which stipulates fire safety requirements for buildings. SCDF regularly reviews the Fire Code to ensure that it keeps up with changes in the built environment and developments in fire safety. The Fire Code was last updated in 2018.The Fire Code has specific provisions to ensure better fire protection for conserved buildings. For example, conserved shophouses with timber flooring are required to install fire-rated floor boards to prevent the spread of fire between floors as well as fire alarms within the premises.  SCDF recognises that older buildings, including conserved buildings which have not undergone upgrading works over time may face higher safety risks as they are then not obliged to comply with the latest Fire Code. The Ministry will be amending the Fire Safety Act later this year to require owners of such buildings to carry out critical fire safety upgrades if assessed to be necessary.The Member also asked what is done to ensure that upgrading works for conserved buildings are properly carried out. In all upgrading works, the appointed registered architects or professional engineers, also known as Qualified Persons are responsible for ensuring compliance with the Fire Code. An independent Registered Inspector will inspect the building when the works are completed to ensure that the fire safety requirements have been met. In addition, SCDF conducts random audits and inspections. "
impact on singapore of prolonged stoppage of water treatment at johor plant,Mr Seah Kian Peng asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what is the impact to Singapore in the event of a prolonged stoppage of water treatment operations at the Johor River Waterworks; and (b) what are Singapore's obligations to provide treated water to Johor under such a scenario.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: PUB will shut down its Johor River Waterworks when the Johor River is affected by pollution upstream of our waterworks. Johor also has water treatment plants along the Johor River, upstream of the Johor River Waterworks, and will shut down the plants when pollution occurs upstream of them.Since 2017, there have been seven pollution incidents along the Johor River which caused PUB’s Johor River Waterworks to be temporarily shut down. These incidents have been traced to illegal discharges from premises such as palm oil mills and chicken farms within the catchment area. These pollution incidents typically cause disruptions ranging from several hours to several days. So far this year, there have been two pollution incidents, with the most recent one on 4 April 2019, where there were high ammonia levels in the Johor River. Given the importance of the Johor River to the water supply of both Singapore and Johor, we have expressed our concern over the frequent recurrence of pollution incidents to Malaysia, both at the federal and state levels. Most recently at the Singapore–Malaysia Leaders’ Retreat in April, Prime Minister Lee raised concerns over pollution in the Johor River and the severe impact of pollution incidents on both countries.Under the 1962 Water Agreement, Singapore is entitled to draw 250 million gallons per day (mgd) of water from the Johor River, while Johor is entitled to buy treated water up to 2% of the total quantity of water we import to Singapore on any given day, or about 5 mgd when Singapore draws its full entitlement. In practice, we have been selling Johor 16 mgd of treated water, which is in excess of their entitlement, at Johor’s request. We do so on a goodwill basis without prejudice to our rights under the 1962 Water Agreement. When we are unable to import any water from Johor due to pollution, Singapore has no obligation to supply treated water to Malaysia.During these pollution incidents, PUB works closely with the Johor authorities to flush the polluted water column from the Johor River. Such collaboration between PUB and its Johor counterparts has helped us to manage the pollution incidents. PUB conducts stringent water quality tests to ensure that the raw water from the Johor River is suitable for treatment before resuming abstractions and operations. During such temporary disruptions, PUB steps up production at desalination plants and local waterworks to meet Singapore’s demand.Nevertheless, pollution incidents along the Johor River impacts the water supply of both countries, and remain a serious concern. We will continue to engage our Malaysian counterparts on the need for them to take measures to prevent future pollution incidents along the Johor River."
singaporeans or prs involved in easter sunday bombings in sri lanka,"Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether any Singaporeans, Singapore Permanent Residents or families with a Singapore-nexus have been casualties in the bombings in Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday 2019; and (b) what can our security agencies learn from the bombing incidents to help deter similar acts of violence from happening in places of worship in Singapore.","Mr K Shanmugam: The Easter Sunday bombings in Sri Lanka was one of the most horrific terrorist attacks since 11 September, leaving more than 250 dead and 500 wounded. There were no Singaporeans among the casualties, and we do not know of any Singapore Permanent Residents who were injured either. However, a Singapore-based British lawyer, Anita Nicholson and her two children Alexander and Annabel, were killed. We are deeply saddened. MFA has been working with our Honorary Consul-General in Colombo to monitor the situation closely and to help Singaporeans there. There are several lessons.First, international cooperation is crucial to combating terrorism. In the lead-up to the attacks, it was reported that the Sri Lanka authorities had received information from foreign counterparts. Unfortunately, it appears that not enough was done to follow up on the information. In our region, security agencies regularly share intelligence for our common fight against terrorism. Such collaboration has helped to thwart many plots and attacks.  Second, the importance of security forces being able to respond swiftly when attacks occur. In periods of heightened threat, Police will step up deployment at places with high human traffic and at sensitive locations such as places of worship. We are ramping up the number of Police In-Situ Reaction Teams deployed on the ground at areas with high footfall, such as Orchard Road and Marina Bay, to provide quick response. They are highly trained to deal with terror incidents, and complement the existing Emergency Response Teams and Rapid Deployment Troops.  Third, it is important to have strong support from building owners to adopt enhanced security measures. The Police will work closely with them to enhance the security of their premises. These include installing hostile vehicle mitigation measures, CCTVs, deployment of security officers for checks on persons and belongings, and even structural hardening against bomb blasts. As for places of worship, MCCY has distributed a security advisory to them. Later this year, MCCY will also be introducing the SGSecure Community Network Crisis Preparedness Accreditation Scheme for religious organisations. Under the scheme, MCCY will produce and disseminate checklists and resource guides that will help them improve their crisis preparedness. It is also important that the general population be prepared against the terror threat. If they react appropriately, they will stand a better chance of survival, and perhaps even prevent the attacks in the first place. As part of SGSecure, we sensitise Singaporeans to identify and report suspicious items and behavior, to ""Run, Hide, Tell"" when the attacks are in progress, and to help fellow Singaporeans who are injured with ""Press, Tie, Tell"". The Sri Lanka attacks are another clear example of the need to act decisively and firmly against radicalisation, whether online or on the ground. The leader of the attacks, Zahran Hashim, had been preaching messages of hate against non-Muslims for a period of time. The group he led was not large, but he was able to use social media to spread his message to a wider audience. Despite his active propagation of messages of hate, neither Zahran nor his group were picked up. And his messages of hate were not stopped. This allowed him time and space to brainwash many Sri Lankan Muslims into carrying out the attacks, including some prominent and well-off members of the community. Singapore has zero tolerance. We will continue to be strict about hate speech and radical ideology, and will deal with their purveyors. Finally, the criticality of racial and religious harmony in society. Sri Lanka has gone through years of turmoil because of racial and religious tension. Up till 2009, Sri Lanka was embroiled in a decades-long civil war between the majority Sinhalese and the minority Tamils that killed more than 100,000 people. More recently, there had been riots between the Sinhalese Buddhists and the Muslims. Now, the Catholics and Christians have been targeted. This is very sad.  If any attack were to succeed here, we must not allow it to seriously affect the racial and religious harmony which we have painstakingly built up over 50 years, and which has been a cornerstone of our peace and progress. Our racial and religious harmony did not come about by chance, and it should never be taken for granted. It is fragile, and can all too easily be shattered, not just by distrust in the aftermath of a terror attack, but by careless and irresponsible words and expressions during times of peace. Nor should we believe that no one will be offended, and allow offensive speech or hate speech in public discourse.  "
preventive measures at hospitals in light of emergence of drug-resistant superbugs,Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked the Minister for Health in light of the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria and fungus including Candida auris (a) whether the Ministry will be revising its strategy on measures to deal with superbugs; and (b) how will preventive measures be strengthened in our hospitals and clinics.,"22 Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Health in light of the dangers of multidrug-resistant pathogens such as candida auris, what measures are being planned to ensure that public confidence in our hospitals remains high. Mr Gan Kim Yong: The emergence of microorganisms such as viruses, bacteria and fungi which are resistant to standard drugs and treatments, a phenomenon also known as Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR), is a global public health issue. While AMR can occur naturally in some microorganisms, the misuse and overuse of antimicrobials such as antibiotics globally in healthcare, as well as the animal and agricultural sectors, have led to accelerated development of AMR. Due to increased global connectivity, there is a growing risk of AMR being spread internationally. Singapore, being a global travel hub, is exposed to the importation of AMR organisms.Candida auris is one example of an antimicrobial resistant fungus. It was first identified in 2009 in Japan and subsequently reported from other parts of the world, including Singapore. The first case of Candida auris here was reported in 2012. To date, a total of 16 cases have been detected in the public and private hospitals. Investigations showed that the cases are unlinked, and there is no report of local spread. We have put in place a number of measures to address the development and spread of AMR in Singapore. These include regulation on the prescription and retail of antibiotics to minimise the risk of misuse and overuse, and public education campaigns on the proper use of antibiotics, such as HPB’s ""Use Antibiotics Right"" campaign in 2018. Within our public hospitals, there are Antimicrobial Stewardship Programmes to guide doctors in making appropriate antimicrobial drug use, and Infection and Prevention Control measures to reduce the risk of spread of antimicrobial-resistant organisms. Notwithstanding these measures, we can expect infections with antimicrobial-resistant organisms to occur from time to time as microbes can naturally acquire AMR and antimicrobials still need to be used for treating infections. Healthcare institutions must therefore remain vigilant in surveillance and maintain high levels of infection prevention and control to prevent spread of AMR. MOH also works with healthcare institutions to monitor antimicrobial resistance and healthcare-associated infections.As AMR is a cross-border issue, MOH also participates in regional and global collaborations to tackle the AMR challenge.We launched the National Strategic Action Plan on AMR in end 2017 to outline our long term approach towards AMR. This was the result of a joint review by MOH, National Parks Board, Singapore Food Agency, National Environment Agency and PUB, Singapore’s national water agency. The plan is aligned to the global action plan on AMR. Under the plan, we are progressively implementing enhanced measures in the priority areas of Education, Surveillance, Research, Prevention & Control of Infection and Optimization of antimicrobial use. The AMR Coordination Office was also established as the national coordinating body to facilitate the implementation of the National Strategic Action plan on AMR.Beyond actions taken by agencies and professionals, individuals too play a part in the prudent use of antibiotics or antimicrobials. We encourage patients and consumers to consult doctors on the best course of medical treatments, take antimicrobials according to doctor’s advice and only when indicated. Everyone of us must also practise good personal hygiene to protect ourselves from infection.  "
average cpf balance of persons in different income groups and proposal to offer differentiated cpf interest rates,Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the average CPF balance for individual CPF members at varying percentiles from the 5th to the 95th percentile; and (b) whether the CPF Board will consider offering differentiated interest rates so those with lower CPF balances can receive more interest to build up their balances and a lower interest rate for those who have high balances.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: The CPF system is already designed to be progressive through limits on CPF contributions and differentiated interest rates. There are monthly and annual limits on the amount of CPF contributions a member can make. Mandatory CPF contributions from ordinary wages are capped at the salary ceiling of $6,000 per month. The maximum amount of mandatory and voluntary contributions that a person can make in a calendar year is subject to the CPF annual limit, currently at $37,740. CPF members with lower balances earn a higher effective interest rate than those with higher balances. This is because CPF interest rates are differentiated based on a member's CPF balance. Balances in the Ordinary Account earn 2.5% per annum, while those in the Special Account, Retirement Account, and MediSave Account earn 4% per annum. On top of this, since 2008, an Extra Interest of 1% is paid on the first $60,000 of combined CPF balances. Since 2016, CPF members aged 55 and above also receive an Additional Extra Interest of 1% on the first $30,000 of their combined CPF balances. Hence, members aged 55 and above enjoy interest rates of up to 6% for the first $30,000, up to 5% for the next $30,000 and up to 4% for balances above $60,000. Members' balances can vary widely due to their unique circumstances, such as differences in age, employment, income, and withdrawals for retirement payouts and housing payments. In 2018, for active CPF members turning 55, more than six in 10 had at least the Basic Retirement Sum (BRS) of $85,500 in their Ordinary and Special Accounts. Over time, we expect members' CPF balances to increase with rising income and labour force participation."
road accidents involving pedestrians using mobile phones,"Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether the Ministry tracks the number of road accidents involving pedestrians who use their mobile phones; (b) if so, what are the numbers of such accidents over the past three years; and (c) whether there needs to be legislation or measures put in place to deter people from using their mobile phones while walking.","Mr K Shanmugam: The Police do not track the number of accidents involving pedestrians who were using their mobile phones when the accident occurred. The use of mobile phones is but one of many activities that can cause pedestrians to be distracted while crossing roads. Other examples include reading a book, listening to music through headphones and earphones, or talking to another person. It is not practical to try to legislatively prohibit pedestrians from engaging in such activities. A better approach is to foster good road safety habits and personal responsibility. In this regard, Traffic Police (TP) conducts regular outreach to educate the public on the dangers of distracted crossing. An example is the ""Use Your RoadSense"" initiative. As part of this initiative, TP uses traditional and social media to disseminate advisories on safe road-use, such as staying alert to one's surroundings when crossing the road.  Since 2014, LTA has installed ""LOOK"" road markings at zebra crossings, to alert pedestrians to road crossings ahead and to remind them to look out for oncoming vehicles. "
appeals by persons who have obtained bto flats more than twice in five years,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development (a) how many appeals have been received from applicants or joint applicants for BTO flats who have obtained BTO flats more than twice in the last five years; (b) how many of such appeals have been approved; and (c) whether the Ministry will review and revise the existing schemes to accommodate such applicants and allow a conditional third chance to be given to such applicants.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: All eligible Singaporeans can purchase two subsidised BTO flats from HDB, and they have to pay a resale levy for the second purchase.  We have also allowed seniors aged 55 and above to buy a flat from HDB for a third time, but this is limited to a 2-room Flexi flat on a short lease. We are unable to extend housing subsidies for non-elderly households to buy a third new flat, as this would not be fiscally sustainable. However, HDB does receive such appeals and will consider each one on a case-by-case basis. Over the last five years, HDB received about 790 appeals to buy a third subsidised flat. About 150 were approved, based on exceptional circumstances. In particular, if an appellant and his/her spouse are buying a subsidised flat together, and the spouse is a first-timer, HDB may consider making an exception on account of the fact that the spouse has not yet taken up any housing subsidy. "
workplace accidents in schools involving cleaners,"Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Education (a) in the last three years, what has been the trend and number of workplace accidents in schools involving school cleaners engaged by the Ministry; (b) what is the percentage of such school cleaners who have undergone training related to workplace safety and health (WSH); and (c) whether the Ministry can consider mandating all cleaning team leaders and supervisors in schools to attend the WSH Hazard Identification and Risk Management Course to reduce potential workplace injuries sustained by school cleaners.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: Since the current school cleaning contract commenced on 1 October 2017, 35 cases of workplace accidents involving school cleaners were reported to MOM, out of about 3,300 school cleaners engaged. About half of these cases reported involved slips and falls. MOE has been, and will continue to work with our cleaning contractors to pay attention to workplace safety and health issues for school cleaners. To reduce potential workplace injuries, MOE requires all our appointed cleaning contractors to provide a Workplace Safety and Health Officer to carry out risk assessment and monthly cleaning safety checks in schools. In addition, MOE holds regular meetings with our cleaning contractors to look at safety concerns and work together to improve workplace safety for our school cleaners.  Currently, about 50% of the school cleaners have undergone training related to workplace safety and health. We will take the Member's suggestion to require all cleaners to undergo the training, when we review subsequent school cleaning contracts.  "
government’s stand on developers offering two-year deferment schemes to home buyers,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the Ministry's position on developers who offer two-year deferments to prospective buyers; (b) whether the buyer and seller stamp duty will be based on the date of signing the Option-to-Purchase obtained earlier under the two-year deferment plan or on the date of signing the Sale and Purchase Agreement; and (c) whether developers are required to pay stamp duty for unsold units after five years even after an Option-To-Purchase has been obtained but a Sale and Purchase Agreement has not been executed yet.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Since October 2007, the Government has disallowed deferred payment schemes for uncompleted private residential properties. So deferred payment schemes are only applicable for completed private residential developments. As with any property transaction, buyers should exercise due diligence and prudence before committing to a purchase under such a scheme.  For the purpose of stamp duties, a unit is only considered sold when the Sale and Purchase (S&P) Agreement has been executed. The buyer's and seller's stamp duties are based on the date of execution of the S&P Agreement. Likewise to qualify for ABSD remission, developers will have to ensure that all units within the development are sold, with the S&P Agreements executed, within the prescribed period of five years."
processing time for make-up pay for in-camp training,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Defence (a) why does SAF still require 10 working days to process NSmen make up pay for in-camp training; and (b) whether SAF can reduce the current processing time of 10 working days.,"Dr Ng Eng Hen: NSmen who have submitted their claims are paid their Make-Up Pay within 10 working days from the start of their ORNS activity. The primary reason for this timeline is to verify the NSmen's training attendance before payment is made, to ensure accountability in the use of public funds. In practice, NSmen are typically paid within five working days for Low Key In-Camp Trainings (ICTs) and seven working days for High Key ICTs. In some cases, a longer time may be needed to verify claim details with NSmen and their employers. We regularly review our systems and processes to make the process of claiming Make-Up Pay more efficient and convenient for our NSmen and their employers. Employers are encouraged to register with the Direct Reimbursement to Employers of Claims for NS Training, or DIRECT, scheme. Under this scheme, the employer will continue to pay the serviceman his usual pay and claim reimbursement from MINDEF. "
police reports filed against pmd users,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) in the past three years, how many police reports have been filed against users of personal mobility devices (PMD) who are involved in accidents where their victims were injured; (b) on average, how long does the investigation take to conclude a case; and (c) what is the average amount of compensation that has been ordered by the courts to be paid out to the victims.","Mr K Shanmugam: Between 2016 and 2018, there were about 200 reported accidents involving personal mobility devices (PMD) that resulted in injuries to another person.  Each case is different. The amount of time taken to investigate hence varies, and depends on a number of factors, including the availability of evidence. We do not have information on the average amount of compensation ordered by the courts to be paid to victims. "
cases of suspected unauthorised subletting of hdb flats,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for National Development in the three years prior to 2017 where there were about 70 cases in which enforcement action was taken against errant flat owners whose flats were overcrowded (a) how often are checks and investigations conducted on HDB flats suspected of unauthorised subletting or overcrowding based on public feedback; (b) whether the current penalties are sufficient; and (c) how is the Ministry working with the community to enhance surveillance and awareness.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB flats are meant for owner-occupation. Notwithstanding this, HDB flat owners are allowed to rent out their flats with HDB's approval after they have met the minimum occupation period. Flat owners are responsible for ensuring that there are no dis-amenities or overcrowding in the flats during the period of rental. To ensure that the rules are complied with, HDB carries out proactive inspections on an ongoing basis. In addition, HDB investigates every case of public feedback received on suspected unauthorised rental or overcrowding.  HDB takes a serious view of such infringements and will take action against errant flat owners. Depending on the severity and circumstances of the infringement, HDB may issue a written warning, impose a financial penalty of up to $50,000, or acquire the flats compulsorily from the owners. In cases where the tenant is found to have sublet the flat to occupants without the knowledge of the flat owners, HDB will debar these errant tenants from renting a whole flat for five years. These measures are adequate deterrents.As part of HDB's community outreach efforts, HDB organises community programmes such as Heartland Talks, and publicises cases of action taken against flat owners who have breached the rental rules. HDB residents and members of the public can also play an important role by reporting any suspected infringements to HDB."
complaints from owners of dbss flats about recurrent defects or discoloured floorings,Dr Lily Neo asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether there are ongoing complaints from owners of apartments in DBSS projects about fixture defects such as recurrent discoloured flooring; and (b) what help will the Ministry give to such apartment owners in resolving the issues with the DBSS developer after the defects liability period.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The Design, Build and Sell Scheme (DBSS) was introduced in 2005 to give flat buyers more choice by allowing private developers to design, build and sell flats directly to buyers. While HDB sets the eligibility requirements for purchase and provides broad planning parameters, the DBSS developer is responsible for the design, pricing and construction of the flat.  Under the Sale and Purchase (S&P) Agreement signed between home buyers and the DBSS developer, the developer is contractually required to build the unit in accordance with the materials, finishes, and other specifications set out in the Agreement. The Agreement also stipulates that the developer must rectify any defects within the one-year Defects Liability Period (DLP). Flat owners are responsible for the maintenance of their flats after the DLP.From time to time, HDB is made aware of concerns from some DBSS flat owners about the quality of the fixtures in their flats. In such cases, although HDB is not a party to the S&P Agreement between the developer and the buyer, HDB actively seeks to facilitate a fair and satisfactory outcome. For instance, if HDB receives feedback from DBSS flat owners on new or recurrent defects, whether during or after the DLP, HDB will surface the issues raised to the developer and urge the developer to address the issues with the owners. These issues may be complicated due to differences in views on what constitutes a defect. Should disagreements persist, HDB will advise flat owners to seek independent legal advice on their possible options for recourse under the S&P Agreement."
proportion of children in cohort whose parents maximise co-matching amount for cda,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what is the average and median amount in the Child Development Account (CDA) for children born in 2006 when they reached 12 years of age by 31 December 2018; (b) what is the percentage of children in this cohort where the parents are able to fully maximise the co-matching amount for their child's CDA; and (c) whether the Ministry can extend the closure of a CDA to when the child is 16 years old before the balance is transferred to the child's Post-Secondary Education Account which will then allow the child's parents more years to co-match up to the allowable cap.,"Mr Desmond Lee: Children born in 2006 were eligible for up to $6,000 in Government co-matching in the Child Development Account, or CDA, if they are the second child, and up to $12,000 if they are the third or fourth child. In addition, the 2006 birth cohort was a transitional cohort where parents could choose to either close the CDA at the end of the year their child turned six, or extend the CDA till the end of the year their child turned 12. Parents who chose the latter also had the flexibility to close the CDA at any time when the child was between seven and 12 years old. For those whose CDAs were closed at the end of 2018, the year in which the 2006 birth cohort turned 12, the average and median amounts remaining in the CDA were about $3,300 and $500 respectively. Sixty-four percent of these accounts maximised the Government co-matching in the CDA.When the CDA is closed, the balance is transferred to the child's Post-Secondary Education Account, or PSEA. Today, parents can already continue saving in the PSEA to enjoy Government co-matching if they have not saved up to the co-savings caps in the CDA. "
ensuring uber’s employment practices are in line with singapore’s tripartite standards,Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether the Ministry plans to engage the new management team of Uber's new Asia Pacific Regional Hub to ensure that the company's manpower management will be better this time round and complies with tripartite standards so as to avoid a repeat of employees and contract staff who were left in a lurch during the company's sudden exit in 2018; and (b) whether there remains unresolved disputes among ex-staff and contract workers with regard to their sudden termination.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: Following news of Uber's sudden exit last year, MOM intervened to work closely with Uber's management team to ensure that the Grab-Uber merger was managed sensitively and responsibly. We have been in touch with Uber and will continue to engage them on relevant employment issues. They also pro-actively sought MOM’s advice on a subsequent transaction, and appropriately handled the HR issues in that case. All employees who were affected by the merger have been provided their contractual entitlements, including retrenchment benefits in accordance with the Tripartite Advisory on Managing Excess Manpower and Responsible Retrenchment. There are no unresolved disputes to our knowledge. "
number of and time taken to clear vehicles that break down on the roads,Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the current monthly number of vehicle breakdowns on roads; (b) whether that pattern has changed over the years; (c) what is the most frequent type of vehicles that break down on the roads; (d) what is the current recovery time taken to clear vehicle breakdowns and whether it has improved over time; and (e) what more can be done to reduce the time needed to clear the roads due to vehicle breakdowns.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: LTA provides vehicle recovery services on expressways and tunnels. Vehicle breakdowns along other roads are attended to by private vehicle recovery services; they are not tracked by LTA. Between 2013 and 2018, the number of vehicle breakdowns per month on tunnels and expressways ranged between 2000 and 2500. Cars have consistently accounted for the largest proportion of these breakdowns – about 45% last year. LTA's vehicle recovery services are placed on stand-by near expressways and tunnels, to ensure timely responses. Upon activation, LTA will generally arrive within 8 minutes and 15 minutes for tunnels and expressways respectively, and clear the vehicles within 10 minutes after arrival.  Motorists can play their part, by moving their broken down vehicles to the road shoulder where possible. They should also regularly service their vehicles to minimise such occurrences. "
disallowing cyclists on bus lanes during bus lane operating hours,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Transport whether LTA will consider disallowing cyclists on bus lanes during the bus lane operating hours taking into consideration that the bus lane is not wide enough to provide a safety distance between the bus and the cyclist.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Given our land constraints, cyclists have to share our public road lanes with other road users. We have therefore put in place rules to ensure that cyclists interact safely with other road users. This includes requiring them to keep to the left side of the roads where traffic tends to travel at lower speeds and could include bus lanes. To reduce obstruction to bus passage, cyclists are required to cycle in a single file during bus lane operating hours. We have also been equipping public buses with blind-spot mirrors and new buses with collision warning systems, which help bus captains be more aware of the cyclists around them.Ultimately, road safety is a shared responsibility. Everyone has a part to play by being responsible and keeping a look out for each other."
payment for a&e services in public hospitals,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar asked the Minister for Health (a) whether payment for accident and emergency (A&E) services in the public hospitals is needed to be made in full in cash upfront or after medical treatment has been rendered; and (b) whether low-income or needy patients seeking A&E services are eligible for subsidised fees.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: All patients who visit the A&E department in a public hospital are charged at a single flat subsidised rate for basic investigations and services, regardless of income.  The payment process of A&E departments varies across public hospitals depending on their operational considerations. In emergency cases, such as when patients arrive via ambulance, they are always attended to first and payment is collected after treatment. In some non-emergency cases, the flat fee may be collected upfront, whereas in other cases it would be collected after the service is rendered.  No one will be denied essential healthcare services, including A&E, due to the inability to pay. Patients who face difficulties in paying for their A&E fees can approach the medical social workers to seek financial assistance."
lcd displays at mrt platforms to indicate time remaining before train doors close,"Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry will consider installing LCD display boards with a timer countdown feature on our MRT platforms to indicate the time remaining before the train doors close, for the safety and convenience of MRT commuters.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: LTA and the public transport operators had previously studied having countdown timers for MRT platforms. They concluded that such a feature could create unnecessary anxiety amongst commuters and compromise safety, especially if one’s attention is fixated on the timer and not the surroundings.Instead, our MRT platforms are equipped with audio and visual cues to alert commuters of closing doors. Commuters are familiar with the train chimes and flashing lights. These are features consistently applied to all our MRT lines, and most systems in other cities."
number of people using medisave to pay for parents' healthcare bills,"Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for Health in each year of the past five years, what is the number of people using MediSave to pay for their parents' healthcare cost and what is the median withdrawal value.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Over the past five years, the number of Medisave withdrawals for parents' healthcare expenses has varied between 161,000 in 2014 and 193,000 in 2018, or 9.7% and 3.8% respectively of the total number of Medisave withdrawals. The average withdrawal amount ranged between $760 in 2014 to about $440 in 2018.  "
proposal for anti-scalping legislation in singapore to keep in check black market for concert tickets,"Mr Ong Teng Koon asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) whether the Ministry will consider the anti-scalping laws of other jurisdictions, for example the Major Sports Facilities Act (Queensland, Australia), the Digital Economy Act (UK), the Places of Public Entertainment Ordinance Act (Hong Kong), the Securing Paper Distribution of Entertainment Tickets Act (Japan), and similar legislation in more than 10 states in the United States; and (b) whether the Ministry will study the implementation of such legislation in Singapore to protect the interests of consumers from market manipulation by scalpers.","Mr Chan Chun Sing: Generally, there is no prohibition against the resale of goods and services in Singapore, including concerts and sports events tickets, subject to the terms and conditions of the event organiser. The margin which resellers can command is freely determined between willing buyers and sellers.  Event organisers can prohibit resale. Some have put in place measures to curb the unauthorised sales of their tickets. These include printing the names of event goers on tickets and stating clearly that the tickets are not transferrable. Event organisers may also conduct identification checks and void tickets which have been sold by unauthorised sellers.  The Government's approach on consumer protection is based on promoting fair trading by businesses and helping consumers make informed purchasing decisions. We encourage consumers to take steps to protect themselves before making their purchases. Consumers who are purchasing tickets of concerts and sports events can, for example, check the terms and conditions of such tickets carefully before making their purchases, and compare the resale price with the original price of the tickets. If consumers are unsure about the legitimacy of the tickets they are about to buy, they should approach the official event organisers for verification to avoid paying for a ticket which may be subsequently voided by event organisers. If consumers have reason to believe that suppliers have engaged in unfair trading practices in the sale of tickets, for example, false and misleading claims, they can approach the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) with details of these practices for CASE to assist them in seeking redress from the suppliers. The Competition and Consumer Commission is also empowered with investigation and enforcement powers under the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act to take action against errant suppliers who persist in unfair trading practices. The Police can also investigate if there is fraudulent activity involved in the sale of tickets.We assess that our current position strikes an appropriate balance between protecting consumers and allowing market forces to operate. We will continue to monitor international developments and the experience of countries with anti-scalping laws and adjust our position if necessary. "
quality of training at overseas medical schools dropped from approved list,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Health (a) what are the concerns with the quality of training at the 57 overseas medical schools that are to be dropped from the current list of 160 approved schools; (b) how are these concerns measured and determined; and (c) whether Singaporean students currently studying at these schools or doctors who have graduated from these schools should be concerned with the quality of their training.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: With the addition of Duke-NUS Medical School1 in 2005 and the Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine in 2013, the annual intake of medical students across the three medical schools in Singapore grew from about 300 in 2010 to 502 in 2018. With more doctors being trained locally, we can moderate the number of approved overseas medical schools.The Singapore Medical Council's (SMC) Schools Review Committee took into consideration various factors including the academic standing and reputation of the schools, reflected by international and national rankings, as well as the performance of our doctors from these universities and how well they adapt to our system when they return to work in our healthcare institutions.Overall, the SMC chose to retain schools with higher international and national rankings and where SMC's data indicates that doctors who graduated from the schools had performed satisfactorily and had fewer challenges adapting to the local practising environment.Singaporean students currently studying at, or who will be commencing their medical study before 1 January 2020, and doctors who have graduated from the affected schools will not be affected by this change. All doctors who graduate from overseas schools will be orientated to the local working environment, and they will be assigned a supervisor to ensure that they are able to adapt well.MOH and SMC reviews the list regularly based on the evolving needs of Singapore's healthcare system. For example, SMC had reduced the number of approved medical schools in 1993 and had increased the number of approved medical schools between 2003 and 2007, to cater to the changing needs of our healthcare system."
acra’s oversight of auditors whose audit opinions of listed companies found wanting,Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) what oversight does ACRA have over auditors whose audit opinions of listed companies are later found to be wanting; and (b) what action is taken against such audit firms or their partners when they are found to be negligent.,"Mr Heng Swee Keat: Under the Accountants Act, the Public Accountants Oversight Committee or PAOC is empowered to inspect public accountants' audits of companies' financial statements. The PAOC is a Board committee under the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority or ACRA. The inspections assess public accountants' compliance with the Singapore Standards on Auditing, which are consistent with international auditing standards.The PAOC's inspections aim to deter audit deficiencies and raise audit quality. Public accountants with audit deficiencies will be sanctioned. Depending on the severity of the deficiencies, the PAOC can inspect the public accountant again, require the public accountant’s work to be reviewed by another public accountant, restrict the type of services that the public accountant can provide, or suspend or cancel the public accountant’s license. The names of public accountants whose licenses have been suspended or cancelled will also be published on the ACRA website.The current audit inspections cover public accountants. Later this year, we plan to amend the Accountants Act to expand audit inspections to audit firms and to apply sanctions for audit firms' lapses. The proposed amendments will hold audit firms to higher accountability.Our regulatory measures are aimed at providing greater assurance to the public that audits by public accountants meet prevailing standards. However, all parties involved in companies, including directors, audit committees, management, and the accounting profession, have a responsibility and a role to play in ensuring the quality of financial reporting. Investors too need to take appropriate steps to understand the health of the companies and apprise themselves of risks versus returns, when deciding whether to make an investment."
impact of instrument landing system withdrawal at seletar airport,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Transport following Singapore's withdrawal of the use of the Instrument Landing System (ILS) for Seletar Airport (a) what are the technical and commercial consequences to Seletar Airport; and (b) whether the ILS is regarded as necessary for the operation of Firefly flights at Seletar Airport when Singapore first decided to implement the ILS.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Seletar Airport has been operating as a visual airport for decades. This means that pilots flying to and from Seletar Airport need to be able to clearly sight the runway and their operating environment when landing and taking off. This also means that during bad weather, flights may have to be delayed or diverted to other airports. This arrangement has worked well for Seletar Airport as it is a rather small airport.  In 2017, when arrangements were being planned to shift Firefly's flights to Seletar, Firefly asked the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) to install at Seletar Airport an Instrument Landing System (ILS) and its associated flight procedures. Firefly had informed CAAS that an ILS was a requirement by its regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority of Malaysia (CAAM). CAAS agreed to the request as the ILS would also have enabled all other pilots to operate at Seletar in all weather conditions. While ILS is a commonly used instrument approach, it is not the only one. CAAS and CAAM are working on an alternative, using GPS-based instrument approach procedures. Meanwhile, flights to and from Seletar Airport are using visual procedures as in the past. "
complaints to council of estate agencies about property agents,Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for National Development over the past three years (a) how many complaints have been made to the Council of Estate Agencies (CEA) about property agents; (b) what is the nature of the complaints made; and (c) how many property agents have been sanctioned by CEA for misconduct.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Between 2016 and 2018, the Council for Estate Agencies (CEA) received a total of 2,489 complaints against estate agents and salespersons, or an average of about 830 each year. Most of the complaints related to service quality and unprofessionalism, such as no-show at appointments. CEA also received complaints on potentially misleading or inaccurate advertisements, and complaints on alleged misconduct, such as failure to declare conflict of interest.There are three courses of action that CEA can take to punish errant estate agents and salespersons – Court prosecution, action by CEA's Disciplinary Committee, or the issuance of warning letters. Over the past three years,a.  23 salespersons were convicted in court for offences such as the illegal handling of transaction monies, and were fined.b.  CEA's Disciplinary Committee took action against six estate agents and 42 salespersons for misconduct such as failure to conduct their work with due diligence. The Disciplinary Committee meted out financial penalties, and suspended the salespersons’ registration status.c.  Finally, about 700 warning letters were issued to deal with minor infractions.  "
proposal to review international arbitration act to allow for appeal through singapore courts,Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Law whether the Ministry will consider reviewing the International Arbitration Act to provide for an avenue of appeal to our Singapore courts where it is alleged that there are errors of law in the award issued by an arbitral tribunal.,"Mr K Shanmugam: Arbitration is a popular means of resolving commercial disputes. One of the reasons for its popularity is that it allows parties to have the autonomy to choose how their dispute should be resolved. This includes options like where the dispute should be heard and who should hear the dispute. Singapore has over the years become a popular seat of international commercial arbitration. According to the White & Case and Queen Mary University of London's International Arbitration Survey in 2018, Singapore and the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) were ranked as the third most preferred arbitration seat and arbitral institution in the world respectively, and first in Asia. The SIAC announced in its 2018 Annual Report that it has, for the second year running, received over 400 cases from parties in 65 jurisdictions. The total sum in dispute for all new case filings in 2018 was USD 7.06 billion (SGD 9.65 billion), an increase as compared with 2017.1The Ministry keeps track of developments in international best practices, to ensure that our framework stays responsive to users' evolving needs. Significant changes to the International Arbitration Act over the years include broadening the definition of an arbitration agreement and providing recourse against negative jurisdictional rulings by an arbitral tribunal. These changes reflect Singapore's commitment to support international commercial arbitration by enhancing the suite of options available for users, strengthening Singapore's position as the preferred destination for premier legal services. As part of my Ministry's efforts to update the legal framework, my Ministry has noted that in certain other jurisdictions, parties to an arbitration may appeal against an award on a question of law. Currently, under our International Arbitration Act, parties who wish to challenge an arbitral award may apply to the High Court to set aside a final award. However, they may only do so on limited grounds relating to issues of jurisdiction, procedural irregularity, fraud, corruption or public policy. These grounds are as set out in Article 34(2) of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration and section 24 of the International Arbitration Act. There is no avenue for parties who wish to appeal to our Courts on a point of law in the award in international arbitrations. My Ministry is currently reviewing the International Arbitration Act, taking into account the experience of other jurisdictions. One of the amendments we are considering will allow parties to appeal to the courts on a question of law arising out of an arbitration award, provided that they have agreed to contract in or opt in to this mechanism. Such appeals could be heard in the High Court, with safeguards to prevent frivolous or vexatious appeals. Proponents of this option have said that it enhances party autonomy and injects greater flexibility for parties to opt for an appeal process to the courts if they wish to do so, while preserving certainty and finality. My Ministry intends to conduct a public consultation on this, and other enhancements to the International Arbitration Act, and will release further details in due course.        "
public education on dangers of consumption of psychoactive substances,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Home Affairs how is the Government educating the public on the dangers of the consumption of psychoactive substances since there is some misconception that such drugs are less risky compared to hard drugs.,"Mr K Shanmugam: As the Member pointed out, New Psychoactive Substances, also known as NPS, have been wrongly perceived by some people to be less addictive and less dangerous. Nothing could be further from the truth. These drugs are known to have adverse, irreversible physical and psychological effects. The Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) adopts a targeted approach to raise awareness about the harms of drugs. Since 2016, CNB has been driving an online campaign to strengthen the resilience of our youths against drug misinformation. They are provided with facts about the harms of drugs, including NPS, to counter the false information being propagated online that downplays the danger. CNB has enhanced its social media platforms to push out its messages. Many of the anti-drug videos posted online by CNB have been widely viewed. CNB will continue with these social media campaigns to feature bite-sized infographics and youth-centric content. To address the increasingly liberal attitudes among youths, the National Council Against Drug Abuse, or NCADA, launched a ""Feed Ambition. Fight Temptation"" campaign in October 2018. Opinion leaders were roped in to engage youths in a mentorship programme, encouraging them to pursue their passion and stay away from drugs.Youths are also given the opportunity to take greater ownership in the fight against drugs. In December last year, a new illustrated book ""Captain Drug Buster versus Dr Wacko: The Final Showdown"" was published. This was a collaboration with young illustrators. The book educates children on the harms of drug abuse, and serves as a resource for parents and educators to start the conversation on drugs with the young ones. We will make copies of the book widely available.CNB has also been engaging NS commanders and educators on a sustained basis, to raise their awareness and understanding of Singapore’s drug control policies, as well as to rally their support for anti-drug advocacy.A DrugFreeSG Community Roadshow was held in April 2018 to enhance outreach in the heartlands, targeting parents. Two more will be organised in 2019.These are just some examples of CNB's preventive drug education efforts. We have seen encouraging results. We will need to continue countering the increasingly widespread portrayal in the popular media, of drug consumption as being a socially acceptable activity.   "
interest earned under cpf life cannot be bequeathed,Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for Manpower since the inception of CPF LIFE (a) how many CPF members have foregone their earned interest upon their demise; (b) what is the total amount of forgone interest deposited into the Lifelong Income Fund to date; and (c) whether members are made aware that the interest earned under CPF LIFE does not come under their estate and cannot be bequeathed should there be any unused annuity premium to be refunded.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: CPF LIFE has become a key pillar of our retirement system since it was introduced a decade ago in 2009. CPF LIFE protects Singaporeans against longevity risk, by providing them with a monthly retirement payout for life. This ensures that CPF members will not outlive their savings, even as life expectancy increases. Let me explain how it works. Members join CPF LIFE today when they are ready to start their monthly payouts. They do so by committing a sum of CPF savings to a CPF LIFE plan. This sum is known as a 'premium', similar to how one would purchase an insurance cover. The interest that is earned on CPF LIFE premiums is pooled into the Lifelong Income Fund. This interest is up to 6% per year, comprising the base interest of 4% and 1% each from Extra Interest and Additional Extra Interest. Each member's premium is used to provide him with monthly CPF LIFE payouts. However, when the premium is exhausted, the member will continue to receive monthly payouts by drawing on the pooled interest. For example, if a member commits $60,000 to CPF LIFE under the Standard plan and starts payouts at 65, his premium will be exhausted at the age of 79 and he will then continue to receive payouts from the pooled interest for as long as he lives.In other words, through the pooling of interest, the member is effectively shielded from the risk that he will outlive his savings. In fact, Mr Png recognised this when he told this House in 2014 that CPF LIFE was a better scheme as it guaranteed payouts for life. But Mr Png is incorrect to describe the pooled interest as ""forgone"" because as I explained, every CPF LIFE member has a chance to draw on it once his own premiums have been fully paid out. He could even draw more from the interest pool than he put into it. The pooled interest ultimately benefits the members of CPF LIFE. Moreover, because the interest earned is risk-free and the membership pool is very large, CPF LIFE members receive one of the highest payout per dollar of premium, compared to similar annuity products in the market. A member and his loved ones will also always get back his CPF LIFE premium in full, in the form of monthly payouts and/or bequest, no matter what age he lives to. When a CPF LIFE member passes on, any unused premium will be distributed to the deceased member’s nominees. This is clearly communicated to members in the CPF LIFE application form and the yearly CPF LIFE payout statement.CPF LIFE is a relatively young scheme. Members who currently receive CPF LIFE payouts have voluntarily opted into CPF LIFE at various ages. The first mandatory cohort of CPF LIFE members will only reach their payout eligibility age in 2023. However, in the long run, we expect a large majority of CPF LIFE members to draw payouts from the pooled interest. In any case, all members can be assured that their premiums are fully safeguarded for them and their loved ones. And what interest remains in the pool ultimately benefits members through lifelong payouts. CPF Board has stepped up its efforts to help members make informed choices on their CPF LIFE plans. For example, the CPF LIFE estimator on the CPF website allows members to estimate their payouts and bequest amounts at different ages. The Board also offers a CPF Retirement Planning Service to all members reaching 55 years old, and their Payout Eligibility Age. This is a one-to-one session whereby a CPFB officer provides personalised guidance to the member, such as the various CPF LIFE plans they can choose from and the estimated payouts depending on the amount set aside. I hope that Members can encourage their residents to make full use of this Service and to approach CPF Board if they have queries about CPF LIFE.                       "
review ban against e-cigarettes as alternative for long-term smokers,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry will review the ban against e-cigarettes as an alternative for long-term smokers to help them reduce the number of cigarettes smoked.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Ministry of Health (MOH) has banned Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems, including e-cigarettes for several reasons.First, e-cigarettes are harmful to health. Their vapour contains toxic cancer-causing substances, as well as nicotine, which is highly addictive and has harmful effects on foetuses and brain development in adolescents.Second, experience in other countries shows that there is a danger of e-cigarettes becoming entrenched in Singapore if we lift the ban. For example, an estimated 2.8 million adults in Great Britain used e-cigarettes in 2016, representing a four-fold increase from 700,000 users in 2012. In England, among 11 to 15 year-olds, one in 16 were current e-cigarette users in 2016, a 50% increase from 2014.Third, e-cigarettes can be a gateway or 'starter product' which hooks youth on nicotine and leads them to cigarette use later. A systematic review of nine studies involving more than 17,000 youths in the United States found that e-cigarette users were three times more likely to become cigarette smokers compared to non-users. Another study among more than 19,000 Canadian youth, showed that e-cigarette users were twice as likely to go on to smoke cigarettes regularly. Other studies in England, Scotland and Poland similarly support this 'gateway effect'.Nevertheless, we are open to companies registering a specific e-cigarette product under the Health Products Act as a therapeutic product for smoking cessation, if they are able to provide sufficient evidence that the product they are registering is safe and effective.The current evidence on the role of e-cigarettes in aiding smoking cessation remains limited and mixed. Earlier this year, results from the first randomised controlled trial comparing e-cigarettes and Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) was published. The study involved about 900 smokers with good motivation to quit. When combined with counselling, 18% of the smokers in the e-cigarette group quit smoking at twelve months post-intervention, compared to 10% of smokers from the NRT group. However, in the e-cigarette group, 80% of those who quit smoking continued to use e-cigarettes twelve months later. This means that overall, less than 4% of those in the e-cigarette group quit tobacco product use and their nicotine addiction totally. As there are concerns about the potential harmful effects of long-term use of e-cigarettes, this raises the question of whether they would have been better off quitting using other methods. In addition, more than 30% of those in the e-cigarette group who failed to quit ended up using both cigarettes and e-cigarettes. This leaves them worse off than before, as a recent large study has shown that dual users of cigarettes and e-cigarettes are exposed to more toxins than persons who only smoke cigarettes. For smokers who wish to quit, there are already approved smoking cessation aids in Singapore which are safe and effective. Smoking cessation counselling, NRT and medications to treat nicotine dependence have all been shown to be effective in helping smokers to quit. There is also the HPB's Quitline for smokers to get more information and support for their quit journey. We will continue to monitor the evidence pertaining to the safety and efficacy of e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation product. Like all therapeutic products for smoking cessation, the onus is on the e-cigarette manufacturer to provide evidence of safety and efficacy. Thus far, none have done so. "
mandatory cybersecurity courses for government and private sector employees,"Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) whether the Ministry will make it mandatory for all employees in the Government and private sectors to attend courses relating to cybersecurity; and (b) beyond Internet separation policies, what else is being done to equip employees with the correct mindset towards cybersecurity.","Mr S Iswaran: The Government is committed to build a strong cybersecurity culture in Singapore, both in the public service and the private sector. Training our people to be aware of cyber threats, and effectively detect and respond to malicious cyber activities, is key. Within the public sector, the Government had introduced an IT security awareness programme in July 2018. It is mandatory for all public officers to complete the course by end of the year to educate all public officers of emerging cyber threats and the cybersecurity measures to take. There is also an annual Cyber Safe Cyber Ready Conference to enhance cyber awareness within the public service, and regular cyber exercises to sharpen the IT security incident response of our public sector agencies. These measures build up our public officers' understanding of cybersecurity. Within the private sector, the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) enhances cybersecurity awareness and practices through a variety of channels, such as talks, conferences and CSA's GoSafeOnline portal. CSA has also developed resources such as the Be Safe Online Handbook, launched in 2018, which explains what organisations should do to enhance their cyber defence capabilities such as using only authorised software, and updating systems regularly. CSA's ""Cyber Tips 4 You"" programme also educates the public on four essential cyber hygiene practices to adopt – to use a strong password and two-factor authentication, use anti-virus software, update software as soon as possible and to watch out for signs of phishing. Additional requirements are placed on enterprises that own Critical Information Infrastructure (CII), which are computers or computer systems supporting the provision of our essential services. All CII owners must fulfil their legal obligations under the Cybersecurity Act, including establishing cybersecurity awareness programmes for their employees, contractors and vendors, and participating in cybersecurity exercises to validate their responses to cyber incidents. Our cyber defences are only as strong as our weakest link. Every individual plays a critical role in safeguarding our cyberspace. The Government will continue to work with the private sector, individuals and the community to instil a strong cybersecurity culture, and strengthen Singapore's Digital Defence.        "
seniors aged 65 and above who received payouts from silver support scheme,Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how many seniors aged 65 and above currently receive payouts from Silver Support Scheme in addition to CPF monthly payouts; and (b) what is the average quantum of the combined monthly payouts.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: The objective of Silver Support is to provide retirement support to Singaporeans who had low incomes throughout life. About 20% of elderly Singaporeans aged 65 and above receive quarterly Silver Support payouts of $300 to $750, with those living in smaller flat types receiving higher payouts. In 2018, about 51,000 elderly Singaporeans aged 65 and above received Silver Support payouts in addition to their CPF monthly payouts. Because it is targeted at those with low incomes throughout life, one of the eligibility criteria for Silver Support is low total CPF contributions; understandably, all Silver Support recipients would therefore have low monthly CPF payouts. Many of these members could also have made lump sum withdrawals which now supplement their current payouts. The combined monthly payouts may therefore not be the only sources of retirement income for these members. Nevertheless, for those living in 1- and 2-room HDB flats, the median combined payout is $500 per month, whereas for those in 5-room flats, the median combined payout is $350 per month. For reference, a 65-year-old member who had set aside the Basic Retirement Sum and started his CPF payouts this year would receive $520 per month. On top of their Silver Support and CPF payouts, seniors may receive benefits from the Pioneer and Merdeka Generation Packages, annual GST Vouchers, concessions on Public Transport and caregiver support schemes. Those living in public housing may also receive subsidised rental or utility rebates. Elderly Singaporeans who need additional financial support can apply for ComCare and other assistance schemes.            "
proportion of cases filed at small claims tribunal that relate to tenancy-related disputes,Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Law (a) what percentage of cases filed at the Small Claims Tribunal in the past three years are claims arising from tenancy-related disputes; (b) what proportion of such tenancy-related cases are filed by Singaporeans; and (c) whether there are plans to review existing laws to assist landlords and tenants in preventing or resolving tenancy disputes.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The Small Claims Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear a wide variety of disputes. This includes claims relating to tenancy disputes arising from any contract for the rental of residential premises that does not exceed two years.Based on statistics provided by the State Courts, an average of 10,414 cases were filed at the Small Claims Tribunals each year, from 2016 to 2018. Out of these cases, about nine percent on average were tenancy-related claims. The State Courts does not track the number of such cases which are filed by Singaporeans.We recently amended the Small Claims Tribunals Act to allow the Tribunals to hear more claims in a quicker and more cost-effective manner, as well as to strengthen the Tribunal's case-management powers. One of the enhancements is to allow a Tribunal to order the remedy of delivery of vacant possession. This will allow a landlord to apply to seek that a tenant deliver vacant possession of rented premises in cases of unpaid rent. This will give the Tribunals a greater suite of options to assist landlord and tenants in resolving tenancy disputes.   "
flexibility in imposing household income ceiling on singaporeans who need to care for mentally disabled persons,Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for National Development whether the current policy of imposing a household income ceiling on Singapore citizens intending to purchase BTO flats may be reviewed to provide some flexibility to households who have unique family circumstances such as the need to take care of mentally disabled family members that require these families to incur higher expenditures or put aside money to deal with the future needs of the disabled family members.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The Housing & Development Board (HDB) is committed to helping Singaporeans, particularly first-timers and lower to middle-income families, to own a home. The income ceiling helps to ensure that housing subsidies are prioritised for those who need them most.The current income ceiling of $12,000 covers the majority of Singaporeans. Nonetheless, for families who exceed the income ceiling but face difficulties such as heavy financial commitments to support family members' medical and living expenses, HDB will review these cases to see how best we can assist them.In addition, households earning more than $12,000 a month can purchase a flat from the HDB resale market, where there is no income ceiling restriction.   "
causes of death of two saf personnel found dead in saf camps in july and september 2018,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Defence in respect of the two SAF personnel who were found dead in SAF camps in July and September 2018 respectively (a) what were the causes of the deaths; (b) whether the deaths were related to issues experienced in the course of service; and (c) prior to their deaths, whether their commanders or colleagues were aware of any problem or difficulty which had a bearing on their deaths.","Dr Ng Eng Hen: The deaths of two Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) servicemen – one a Regular serviceman and the other a full-time national serviceman – in July and September 2018 respectively on SAF premises were due to unnatural causes not related to service.Police investigations to ascertain the causes and circumstances connected with these two deaths have been completed and submitted to the State Coroner. The State Coroner found that there was no evidence of foul play and that the deaths were deliberate acts of suicide. The State Coroner did not identify any contributory factors related to their commanders or colleagues, NS or work that could have led to the incident.   "
demand for and supply of moe kindergarten places,Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for Education (a) what is the number of MOE Kindergarten (MK) places that are presently available in primary schools; (b) how has been the take-up rate and whether there are enough places to meet current demand; (c) whether the current expansion plans are sufficient to meet future demand; and (d) whether there is a need to expedite plans to build more MK centres.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: Today, Ministry of Education (MOE) runs 24 MKs. The capacity for K1 intake for 2019 is around 2,700. Demand for MKs has been healthy, with about 85% of places taken up across all centres. The number of MKs will increase to around 50 by 2023.MOE will continue to work closely with the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) to monitor demand patterns across geographical regions, and ensure that there is an adequate supply of quality and affordable preschool services, through MKs, Anchor Operators and Partner Operators."
sale of government freehold land to private developers,Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for Law (a) how much freehold land is currently possessed by the Government; (b) what is the policy governing the sale of this freehold landbank to private property developers; and (c) how much freehold land has been sold to private developers in the past 10 years.,Mr K Shanmugam: Land held by the Government is released for sale to the private sector for development mainly via open tender through the Government Land Sales (GLS) programme. The lease tenure for land sold under the GLS programme does not exceed 99 years and is determined prior to launch.       
proposal for national water rationing day,Mr Seah Kian Peng asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether the Ministry will consider instituting a national water rationing day as part of our overall national efforts to get the population to use water prudently.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: I thank the Member for his call for all Singaporeans to use water prudently. While we continue to plan ahead and invest in infrastructure and R&D to ensure our water security, we must sustain our push for water conservation. The costly but necessary investments in our water infrastructure will be for naught if we do not manage our water demand. We need to continue to work hard to encourage all Singaporeans to use water prudently. We believe that such good habits are best cultivated from young. Since 2016, the Public Utilities Board (PUB) has worked with schools to organise Water Rationing Exercises in the month of March, as part of Singapore World Water Day. This year, approximately 47,000 students from 116 schools, ranging from pre-schools to tertiary institutions, participated in these exercises. This is the largest number of participating schools to date. In addition, PUB worked with the Ministry of Education to incorporate water conservation topics in the curriculum. These help to reinforce the value of water amongst the students and the need to ""Make Every Drop Count"". For our larger community, PUB takes a multi-pronged approach to encourage water conservation and empower individuals to better manage their water usage. PUB has been carrying out Automated Meter Reading trials, most recently in Punggol and Yuhua. As part of the trials, residents were able to access their water consumption data in near real-time through a mobile app, as well as participate in various water conservation themed games. These have helped to encourage the residents to change their water usage behaviour and adopt good water-saving habits. As the trials have shown encouraging results so far, PUB is exploring how this system can be progressively implemented nation-wide.  PUB has also put in place a mandatory water efficiency labelling scheme, or MWELS, to help consumers make more informed purchasing decisions. We have set minimum water efficiency standards for water fittings and appliances. To further drive the use of more efficient water fittings under the MWELS, the minimum efficiency standards for all fittings will be further raised to 2-ticks from today, 1 April 2019.The responsibility of water conservation does not fall on households alone. Businesses must also play a part. For the non-domestic sector, large water users are required to prepare and submit Water Efficiency Management Plans, which help them to better understand their water usage and identify ways to enhance their water efficiency. PUB supports businesses implementing water-efficient projects through the Water Efficiency Fund. PUB is currently working with the Singapore Environment Council to develop a Green Labelling Scheme for commercial dishwashers, commercial washer extractors and high pressure jet machines in Singapore, to encourage businesses such as hotels, F&B outlets and town councils to purchase water efficient equipment for their business operations. Water is a scarce resource that should not be taken for granted. I urge everyone to do our part to use water wisely, so that we can continue to enjoy it for years to come."
serious accidents involving personal mobility devices,"Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Transport (a) over the last two years, how many serious accidents have there been involving personal mobility devices; and (b) whether there are cases where the victims have been unable to claim for their treatment and left in debt.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: In 2017 and 2018, there were 228 reported accidents involving personal mobility devices (PMDs) on public paths. Of these accidents, there were 196 cases with reported injuries, out of which one was a fatal accident involving a PMD rider who self-skidded and subsequently succumbed to his injuries. 32 other reported cases involved major injuries such as concussions or fractures. We do not have information on the cases where victims are unable to claim their treatment costs from the responsible party and are left in debt. To prevent accidents, deter reckless behaviour and improve active mobility safety, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) has implemented a registration regime for motorised PMDs and lowered the speed limits on footpaths. LTA complements these regulations with strict enforcement to ensure compliance. Individuals caught riding recklessly can be liable upon conviction to a fine up to $5,000 and/or jail up to six months. Those involved in accidents can also be charged for causing hurt or grievous hurt through a rash or negligent act and be liable for fines up to $10,000 and jail terms of up to four years. Several PMD riders have been charged in court with custodial sentences meted out. LTA also conducts extensive publicity and educational efforts to improve awareness and understanding of the regulations and to develop a safe riding culture. Victims injured in active mobility accidents may obtain compensation from the responsible party through private settlement, undertaking mediation with the Singapore Mediation Centre or Law Society of Singapore, or filing a civil suit in the State Courts. If the responsible party is convicted for causing hurt by a rash or negligent act under the Penal Code, the Court may order compensation to be paid to the victim.The Active Mobility Advisory Panel and LTA strongly encourage all active mobility device users to purchase third-party liability insurance to protect themselves against third-party claims in the event of an accident. This will also facilitate claims for treatment costs by victims. LTA has announced that motorised PMD-sharing licensees would be required to procure and maintain third-party liability insurance. LTA is also working with companies such as food delivery companies on the purchase of third-party insurance for their delivery riders.   "
causes of cracks on walls of hdb flats,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for National Development (a) what are the usual causes of cracks on the inside and outside of the walls of HDB flats; (b) what measures does the Ministry take to mitigate these causes; and (c) how often are inspections and maintenance works conducted.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Cracks observed on internal and external walls are usually plaster or skim coat cracks. They are primarily caused by the natural expansion and contraction of building materials, vibration from nearby construction works or renovation activities when residents first move in to their flat. They are non-structural and will not affect the structural integrity of the building.Over the years, HDB has undertaken several steps to reduce the incidence of wall cracks. First, all HDB flats are inspected at the end of construction to ensure that there are no visible cracks on their internal and external walls before they are handed over to residents and Town Councils. Second, HDB's adoption of precast technology in the mid-1980s has reduced the need for plastering. Instead, skim coats are used, which are less susceptible to cracks. Third, to reduce the occurrence of cracks at joints between pre-cast panels, HDB has also improved the design and detailing of the joints over the years. Finally, new methods of construction such as large panel precast elements and prefabricated prefinished volumetric construction have reduced the number of joints where cracks can occur.The Member has also asked about the inspection and maintenance of wall cracks.(a) For cracks on internal walls, during the 1-year Defects Liability Period (DLP) for new flats, flat owners can feedback on cracks observed to their precinct’s Building Service Centre and they will be rectified accordingly. After the 1-year DLP, flat owners are responsible for the inspection and maintenance of the interior of their flats.(b) For cracks on the external walls of HDB blocks, Town Councils are responsible. They conduct regular inspections on the external façade wall and, where necessary, they will engage a Professional Engineer to follow up on any repairs that are required. Nonetheless, to supplement this, HDB conducts annual audit inspections of selected blocks, with a focus on buildings with more facade elements.   "
extension of hpv vaccination programme and one-off catch-up programme to male students,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Health whether consideration can be made to extend the HPV vaccination programme and the one-off catch-up programme to male students as well.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Ministry of Health (MOH), consults the Expert Committee on Immunisation and takes into account criteria such as the disease burden in Singapore, the need for herd immunity as protection against outbreaks of potentially serious diseases, and the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the vaccine, when including vaccines in the national schedules and school-based vaccination programmes. The aim is to prevent diseases with significant public health burden, by encouraging high vaccination take-up rates. The school-based HPV vaccination programme for female students aims to prevent cervical cancer, which is caused by HPV. Cervical cancer is the tenth most common cancer and eighth most common cause of cancer death among females in Singapore. We have assessed that HPV vaccination for females is a cost-effective strategy for preventing cervical cancer. While HPV vaccination also confers protection against genital warts as well as other cancers, such as anal cancer, which are applicable to males, males are not at risk for cervical cancer. Genital warts are a much less serious problem compared to cervical cancer, and the incidence of anal cancer is much lower than cervical cancer in Singapore. HPV vaccination for males is therefore not part of the Committee’s current recommendations.   MOH will continue to monitor the situation, and will review our policy on HPV vaccination for males as and when new developments and evidence emerge on its clinical and cost effectiveness.                  "
"application, issuance and rejection of personal protection orders",Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) how many applications for personal protection orders (PPOs) have been made in the last three years; (b) how many orders have been (i) issued and (ii) withdrawn or dismissed; (c) what are the main reasons for the withdrawal or dismissal; and (d) whether there is a plan to streamline the process for the application of PPOs.,"Mr Desmond Lee: From 2016 to 2018, the Family Justice Courts (FJC) have received a yearly average of about 2,700 applications under the Women's Charter for Personal Protection Orders (PPO) against a family member. In the same period, a yearly average of 1,200 PPOs was issued. The rest of the applications were withdrawn, dismissed, or struck out. A PPO may not be granted for various reasons. For example, the Court may dismiss the application if it is not satisfied on a balance of probabilities that family violence has been committed and that a PPO is necessary. An applicant may also withdraw the application, but only with the permission of the Court. This ensures that the applicant is not coerced into doing so. The Ministry of Social and Family Development and FJC work closely to ensure that the PPO application process is simple and accessible. Over the years, we have increased the number of ways to submit an application. An application can be initiated online for greater convenience. An applicant may also walk into the FJC or any of the three Family Violence Specialist Centres, where staff are available to guide the applicant.        "
effectiveness of online appointment system in reducing waiting time at polyclinics,Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the current average waiting time at the polyclinics; (b) how has the online appointment system helped to reduce the waiting time; and (c) how can the elderly or those who are less IT-savvy be assisted to use the online system especially if the visit is unplanned and necessitated by sudden ailment.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: In 2018, the median waiting time for consultation across all polyclinics was 11 minutes, an improvement from 14 minutes in 2017.Patients with chronic conditions who require regular follow-ups with the polyclinics can schedule their next appointments at the appointment counters after their clinic visits. Individuals requiring unplanned visits necessitated by sudden ailments, can also book an appointment on the same day through online platforms such as HealthHub and the polyclinics' online appointment systems. Alternatively, patients can also call the polyclinics' contact centres to schedule an appointment. With an appointment, individuals would only have to arrive at the polyclinic 15 minutes before their appointment time.As we move towards digital platforms, we are mindful that there may be individuals who are unable to use the online systems, including some seniors. For those who walk in without an appointment, there will continue to be healthcare assistants on-site to assist individuals with the registration process as well as help teach them to use online platforms.

genuine hdb upgraders looking to buy private property but hampered by transitional taxes,Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for National Development how can support be given to genuine HDB upgraders who wish to purchase a private property for owner occupation but find themselves caught in transitional issues such as the hefty Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty, or ABSD, is intended to moderate demand for private residential properties. Any changes to the ABSD regime will have an impact on the property market. So we cannot look at this matter in isolation. The government continues to monitor the property market closely, and will take the necessary measures to ensure a stable property market, with prices moving in line with economic fundamentals. This will ultimately benefit more Singaporeans, including HDB upgraders.      "
update on current bus stop bench replacement exercise,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Transport (a) when was the previous bus stop bench replacement exercise done and how much was spent; (b) when is the current bench replacement exercise expected to end; and (c) how long are these new benches expected to last.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The replacement of bus shelter benches is an ongoing effort. Bus shelter benches are generally replaced when bus shelters are upgraded to better serve commuter needs, when bus shelters need to be relocated or when the benches are no longer in working condition.Over the past five years, around 500 benches were replaced at a cost of around $500 to $1,500 per bench, excluding installation costs. The benches at about 2,300 bus shelters which are at least 15 years old are progressively being replaced by 2020. The new benches come with wider seats and arm rests and are expected to last at least 20 years.  "
review eligibility criteria of dependant's passes for children by considering combined household income,Mr Ong Teng Koon asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Ministry will review the eligibility criteria of Dependant's Passes for children by considering the combined household income if both parents are working on employment or S-passes.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: Singapore is not in a position to support all employment pass or S-pass holders who wish to have their dependants with them here. Another important consideration is the sponsor's ability to afford the family's cost of living in Singapore. As there is no assurance that both parents will have continued employment in Singapore, the fixed monthly salary of the main pass holder is a more stable indicator for assessing the eligibility of the child to be granted a dependant's pass. We have no plans to review this approach.                      "
update on roadmap and industry transformation map for singapore's energy and chemicals sector,"Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) whether the Ministry can provide an update on the roadmap laid out for Singapore's energy and chemicals sector and its Industry Transformation Map, including employment demand and supply outlook in the short to medium term; (b) what is the Ministry's long-term strategy to develop the growing energy and petrochemical sector in Singapore; and (c) which foreign country is the largest investor in this sector.","Mr Chan Chun Sing: The Energy & Chemicals (E&C) industry is an important sector to Singapore’s economy, contributing about 3% of our Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employing about 28,000 people in 2017. US-origin companies account for the majority of net fixed assets in the E&C industry.The E&C Industry Transformation Map (ITM), developed together with tripartite partners, was launched in October 2017, with a two-pronged strategy focusing on transformation and growth. Transformation aims to improve competitiveness of refineries and crackers through asset rejuvenation, while growth is driven by opportunities from high value-added petrochemical derivatives and specialty chemicals. The E&C ITM aims to create 1,400 new jobs and contribute $12.7 billion to Singapore’s GDP by 2025.Over the past one year, the E&C industry has made good progress under several of the ITM pillars. For example, 10 plants have leveraged Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technologies to drive efficiency gains and productivity in their plant operations. In term of innovation, the industry has successfully anchored five application development centres focus on developing applied research capabilities to support specialty chemicals product innovation. We have also observed good outcomes on the jobs and skills front. The Government is working closely with key industry associations, such as the Singapore Chemical Industry Council (SCIC) and Association of Process Industry (ASPRI), to create quality jobs and to enable our people to capitalise on these jobs. One particular initiative is the Chemical Industry Manpower Advisory Committee (Chimac), which is co-chaired by EDB and SCIC, and looks at present and future manpower-related issues such as labour supply, training, and hiring practices, to ensure that future manpower needs of the growing industry can be met. In addition, through initiatives such as the Professional Conversion Programmes (PCPs) and SkillsFuture Earn and Learn Programmes (ELP), 86 mid-career workers were reskilled and successfully placed into suitable E&C jobs, while 134 trainees have been placed in 23 E&C companies respectively. The success of the E&C ITM requires the collective effort of all industry stakeholders. Our trade associations will have to continue playing leadership roles in building capabilities across the community. Companies will have to continue investing in productivity and innovation efforts, and in their workers. Our people too, must be prepared to upgrade their skills, and even take on new job roles. The Government will likewise continue to work with our companies and workers to keep our E&C sector attractive and competitive. "
cool climate solutions for singapore in light of rapidly rising global temperatures,Mr Mohamed Irshad asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what efforts are being undertaken to cool our island in light of rapidly rising temperatures; (b) whether the Ministry has considered using latest technologies such as thermal insulation coating to paint our buildings to reduce temperatures and keep the buildings cool; and (c) what measures are in place to reduce overall energy consumption in Singapore in the face of such rising temperatures.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The Government is mindful of the need to plan for and mitigate rising temperatures. Apart from climate change impacts, temperature rise is also partly due to the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect from urbanisation. Government agencies have implemented measures to help Singapore cope with rising temperatures, and have plans to do more. For example, HDB uses urban environmental modelling to design and orient blocks of flats to maximise wind flow and shade in estates. URA, NParks and other agencies have incorporated green open spaces in our urban landscape and distributed greenery to cool the environment through shade provision and evapotranspiration. We are also encouraging the use of coatings and building materials that limit the absorption and retention of solar radiation.  A key contributor to the UHI effect is heat generated by human activities requiring energy consumption. Hence, a key strategy under the Climate Action Plan is to improve our overall energy efficiency (EE), particularly in the industry sector which is the largest consumer of energy. I will cite a few examples. We amended the Energy Conservation Act in 2017 to enhance the energy management practices of large industrial energy users. Our carbon tax came into force in January this year and sends an important price signal to incentivise emissions reductions in the most economically efficient way. In tandem, we enhanced our grants this year to support the industry sector’s push to improve EE. In the household sector, we introduced the Mandatory Energy Labelling Scheme (MELS) and Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) in 2008 and 2011 respectively, which has raised the EE of energy-intensive household appliances such as air-conditioners and refrigerators. This has helped households to reduce their energy consumption and save on costs. In the building sector, the Government has been driving the adoption of energy-efficient design and solutions for more environmentally sustainable buildings. We are making good progress. The UHI is a complex topic and MEWR and other relevant Government agencies will continue to study this in greater depth. This includes investing in R&D to better understand the effect of rising temperatures on our local microclimate, as well as tapping on technology to help Singaporeans cope with rising temperatures."
programmes to include deaf students in schools,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Education (a) what is the total number of deaf students in schools last year; (b) what inclusion programmes are in place for both the hearing and deaf students; and (c) with the plan to mainstream deaf students, whether the Ministry will consider SgSL (Singapore Sign Language) as an elective ""third language"" for all schools.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: As at December 2018, there were about 1,300 students with reported hearing loss in our mainstream primary and secondary schools. The majority of students with reported hearing loss in mainstream schools have mild symptoms, and are able to communicate with teachers and peers orally. MOE supports their learning by working with organisations such as the Singapore Association of the Deaf (SADeaf) to provide itinerant educational services to these students. MOE also provides funding for these students to use assistive technological devices such as Frequency Modulation systems to help them access the learning.Students with moderate-to-severe hearing loss who require additional educational support have a number of options. For students who communicate orally, they may enrol in Canossian School, a SPED school offering the national curriculum. Canossian School has a satellite partnership with Canossa Catholic Primary School which enables the students with hearing loss to be fully integrated with their mainstream peers. Upon completion of their primary education, these students may articulate to designated mainstream secondary schools, namely St Anthony’s Canossian Secondary School or Outram Secondary School, where there are Resource Teachers to support the learning needs of students with hearing loss.For a small number of students who communicate using sign language, they may enrol in Mayflower Primary School, a designated primary school for Hearing Loss (signing) students. At the school, students with Hearing Loss learn alongside their peers, co-taught by a Specialised Teacher using Singapore Sign Language (SgSL). The school is also resourced with an Educational Interpreter who provides sign interpretation for students to access school-wide activities. Upon completion of their primary education, these HL students may progress to Beatty Secondary School, also a designated school for Hearing Loss (signing) students. For students with more complex needs such as both hearing loss and intellectual disability, they may enrol in Lighthouse School which provides a customised curriculum.                MOE supports the adoption of SgSL as the language of instruction and communication1 in our designated and SPED schools. In these schools, the school community is encouraged to learn SgSL to facilitate communication and interaction with HL students. For example, Mayflower Primary School organises SgSL enrichment programmes for students and teachers who would like to learn the language."
meeting needs of special needs students admitted to ites,"Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked the Minister for Education (a) in the past three years, how many special needs students have been admitted into institutes of higher learning (IHL); (b) how many IHLs are equipped to accommodate special needs students; (c) what is the Ministry doing to help special needs students further their education in IHLs; and (d) whether there are plans to work with ITE to take in more special needs students who may benefit from a vocational education.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: On average, over the last three years, about 2,500 students with Special Educational Needs (SEN) were enrolled in the Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs). This constitutes about 2% of the enrolment in the institutions.All IHLs provide specialised support to students with SEN. Every IHL has a SEN Support Office which provides a one-stop service in supporting students with SEN from pre-enrolment to graduation. The SEN Support Office and the relevant IHL academic department will engage the students to better understand their needs, and offer necessary support such as access arrangements for classes, assessments and examinations. The Offices also administer funding for students to purchase Assistive Technology devices and support services such as text enlargement software, wireless assistive hearing devices and note-taking services. IHLs also work with Voluntary Welfare Organisations for mentorship programmes, internship placements and job matching further help to prepare students with SEN for the workforce. Over the years, ITE has been proactively strengthening its support for students with SEN who will benefit from a vocational education. These students account for about 4% of ITE’s enrolment. ITE will continue to admit any student with SEN who meets their admission criteria. ITE, together with the rest of our IHLs, is committed to supporting all students in their educational journeys. "
effectiveness of differential fares scheme in spreading out mrt commuter load,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether there has been further improvement to the spreading out of MRT commuters during morning peak hours after the Differential Fares Scheme is implemented; and (b) whether he will consider granting further incentives to the elderly to travel during off-peak hours to spread out MRT commuters.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: To encourage off-peak travel, rail commuters enjoy a discount of up to 50-cents if they tap in before 7.45 am under the Differential Fares Scheme. Since the discount was introduced in December 2017, the number of commuters travelling during the morning pre-peak period has increased by 12%. This is significantly higher than the ridership growth of 2%.More than 70% of seniors today travel during off-peak hours. Some of those who travel during the peak period are likely to do so for work. We will continue to monitor the situation before deciding on further incentives for off-peak travel. "
cost of ensuring maritime safety in singapore waters,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Transport since Singapore's independence, how much money has been spent in safekeeping the security, and ensuring the safety of users, of the waters at Tuas South that are within our jurisdiction and port limits, including environmental control, and navigation and maritime management.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Several agencies perform the roles and functions in Singapore Territorial Waters mentioned by the Member, often in close coordination with one another.The agencies carry out their enforcement and operational duties in our waters as part of their overall statutory responsibilities. It is not possible to assign a specific dollar amount to the work carried out only in the waters off Tuas South."
top three causes of death among elderly persons aged 65 years and above,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar asked the Minister for Health for the past five years (a) what are the top three causes of death among elderly persons aged 65 years and above; and (b) what is the number of elderly persons who die annually because of pneumonia or pneumonia-related complications.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: From 2013 to 2017, the top three causes of death among Singapore residents aged 65 years and above were cardiovascular diseases, cancer and pneumonia. During this period, between 3000 to 3750 elderly persons died from pneumonia each year. This made up about 25% of the total deaths among elderly persons."
integrating platforms to facilitate donations through smart nation initiatives,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Prime Minister (a) whether the Smart Nation narrative includes a Smart Giving Nation narrative as part of our aspiration to be a caring, inclusive and resilient society; and (b) if so, how has the Smart Nation blueprint and architecture been planned to support the vulnerable groups as well as to integrate with social sector agencies and giving platforms.","Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): Our Smart Nation narrative, and the framework for implementation has three broad, equally important, thrusts: Digital Economy, Digital Government and Digital Readiness. Digital Readiness includes our strategies to help citizens, businesses, community groups and the Government use technology in an inclusive way to build a caring and resilient society.We want all Singaporeans, regardless of age or ability, to be enabled by digital technology to pursue their dreams and aspirations. This means that everyone should have the digital access, literacy, and confidence to participate in Smart Nation. The Ministry of Communication and Information (MCI) has worked with our community partners to drive readiness programmes at our libraries and community centres. Building a caring, inclusive and resilient society is a whole-of-Nation effort, and our Smart Nation initiatives seek to enable this with technology.Technology allows better partnerships to serve our vulnerable communities. For example, the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) is looking to using digital platforms to work more closely across the social sector agencies, including Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWO)s. This allows agencies to have a comprehensive understanding of families in need, and coordinate support to get families back on their feet. The Ministry of Community, Culture and Youth (MCCY)’s Volunteer.sg and SG Cares app will help volunteers in both public agencies and non-profit organisations to be more engaged and more effective. Platforms such as the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC)’s Dementia Friends and Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF)’s MyResponder allow individuals in need to receive help from the community in real-time.MCI’s Digital Readiness efforts encourage and educate organisations to design for digital inclusion. The Government itself subjects our digital services to regular usability checks. We involve diverse users in the design process.The Smart Nation and Digital Government Group, together with social sector agencies and officers across the public sector are keen to partner community groups and volunteer organisations, so that together, we can better serve all Singaporeans using digital technology."
assessment of singapore companies' vulnerability given china's weakening economic growth,Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for Trade and Industry what is the Ministry's assessment of the vulnerability of Singapore companies with significant investments in China as China witnesses its weakest GDP growth in 28 years.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: Over the years, many Singapore companies have invested in China to ride on its growth. Singapore companies have invested across a diverse range of sectors, from manufacturing to real estate, wholesale and retail trade, to financial and insurance services. The easing of China’s economic growth has been a gradual one, and companies would have carefully made their business calculations and projections accordingly. In our conversations with companies, there is recognition that China's economy is maturing. This includes shifting from an export-led and investment-oriented growth model towards one that is driven by domestic consumption. From rapid growth of 10.6% in 2010, growth has eased in the intervening years to 6.6% in 2018, and the IMF has projected China's 2019 GDP growth to be 6.2% as investment growth moderates and some domestic deleveraging continues. There are also uncertainties in the outlook arising from unresolved United States-China trade tensions, but the Chinese government has made clear its preparedness to bolster domestic demand. Amidst the headwinds facing the Chinese economy, there remain opportunities as China continues to liberalise and pursue its provincial-regional strategies such as the integrated development of mega-regions like the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and Yangtze River Delta. Provinces and municipalities like Guangdong, Jiangsu and Shanghai have maintained growth rates on par with or above China's national average last year.1 To support Singapore companies’ investments in China, Singapore has established a network of provincial business councils in Guangdong, Jiangsu, Liaoning, Tianjin, Shandong, Sichuan and Zhejiang over the years. With the China-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (CSFTA) upgrade to be ratified later this year, Singapore companies can also look forward to improved market access in goods and services. More Chinese companies are also venturing out of China and has chosen Singapore as a launchpad to internationalise their businesses. As of end-2017, China's stock of direct investments in Singapore reached SGD 36.3 billion. This is an increase of around 10% per year on average since 2010.2 There is thus scope for Singapore and Chinese companies to forge closer partnerships and leverage on each other’s networks to tap on opportunities in the region."
muis' review of asatizah recognition scheme,"Prof Fatimah Lateef asked the Minister for Environment and Water Resources & Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs in view of the recent restriction order meted out to a former religious teacher recognised under the Asatizah Recognition Scheme (a) how is MUIS reviewing the Scheme; and (b) whether there will be newer domains for consideration, provisional periods of observation and compulsory face-to-face interviews before final approval of applications under the Scheme.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The Asatizah Recognition Scheme, or ARS, requires all Muslim religious teachers, or asatizah, to abide by a Code of Ethics. This includes not encouraging extremism or violence, denigrating other racial and religious groups, committing ethical misconduct and promoting segregationist practices. The Asatizah Recognition Board, or ARB, oversees the ARS, supported by the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore, or MUIS. The ARB consists of senior and respected asatizah in the community. In her PQ, the Member refers to the case of Mr Murad Mohd Said, who was placed on a Restriction Order in December 2018. Murad's ARS-recognition was cancelled in May 2018, after Murad contravened the ARS Code of Ethics. This is how the ARS system should work. It monitors and takes action to bar those whose views are inimical to social cohesion from preaching. I wish to assure the Member that the ARB and MUIS take ARS registration seriously. Processes have been put in place to ensure that our asatizah registered with the ARS can perform the role that the community entrusts them to do. These processes include, as the Member has suggested, instituting provisional periods of observation and requiring additional interviews when deemed necessary by the ARB. All ARS-asatizah are also required to go for regular training, and their suitability are periodically reviewed. If there are reports or if they demonstrate that they are unfit to be asatizah, such as breaching the Code of Ethics, their ARS status will be cancelled. Both MUIS and the ARB conduct regular reviews of the ARS system. The ARS is meant to build up and support our asatizah community, so that they are reliable and credible sources of religious knowledge for the Muslim community, and play an important role in fostering peace and harmony."
profiteering by scalpers who resell tickets for concerts and sports events at high prices,Mr Ong Teng Koon asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether the Ministry will consider legislation to prevent professional scalpers from profiteering by reselling overpriced tickets of concerts and sports events to genuine consumers.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: Generally, there is no prohibition against the resale of goods and services, including concerts and sports events tickets, subject to the terms and conditions of the original seller. The margin which resellers can command is freely determined between willing buyers and sellers. This means that the resale price can end up being higher or lower than the original price.Government should not prescribe profit margins for ticket resales. We encourage consumers to take steps to protect themselves before making their purchases. Consumers who are purchasing tickets of concerts and sports events can, for example, check the terms and conditions of such tickets carefully before making their purchases, and compare the resale price with the original price of the tickets. If consumers are unsure about the legitimacy of the tickets they are about to buy, they should approach the official event organisers for verification to avoid paying for a ticket which may be subsequently voided by event organisers. If consumers have reason to believe that suppliers have engaged in unfair trading practices in the sale of tickets, for example, false and misleading claims, they can approach the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) with details of these practices for CASE to assist them in seeking redress from the suppliers. The Competition and Consumer Commission is also empowered with investigation and enforcement powers under the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act to take action against errant suppliers who persist in unfair trading practices. The Police can also investigate if there is fraudulent activity involved in the sale of tickets."
possibility of operationalising thomson-east coast mrt line ahead of schedule,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the Thomson-East Coast MRT Line will be operational ahead of schedule; and (b) whether an extension can be made for the Line to connect to Pasir Ris and Punggol to provide additional conveniences and connectivity to residents from the north east.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL) is scheduled to open in stages, starting from December this year. We expect to fully open TEL by 2024. Constructing a rail line is a complex operation. The implementation timelines are carefully planned to ensure safety is not compromised. It is unlikely that we can expedite the opening of the TEL further.  There is no plan to extend the TEL to Pasir Ris and Punggol. However, LTA is studying the feasibility of extending the proposed Cross Island Line (CRL) to serve these areas. Engineering studies for the Pasir Ris – Punggol stretch of the CRL are ongoing."
plans to raise female workforce participation rate,Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the female workforce participation rate over the past three years; (b) what percentage of the female workforce are freelancers; (c) what are the key challenges faced by women who wish to seek employment or who prefer freelance work; and (d) what are the Ministry's plans to raise the female workforce participation rate.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: Our female labour force participation rate for ages 15 and over has moved up in the last ten years, from 56% in 2008 to 60% in 2018. In the past three years, it has remained steady at around 60%. When compared to the OECD countries, we rank well – having improved from 17th to 9th place in the decade. About 6% of our female residents in employment are self-employed1. Like most self-employed persons in Singapore, the majority or about 70% of the regularly self-employed women took on their jobs as their preferred choice and primary form of work. The challenges that women face in seeking employment are similar to what men also face, such as the lack of necessary work experience, qualifications and skills. To help more women join and stay in the workforce, the Adapt & Grow initiative offers services like job matching, training subsidies and salary support to address skills, wage or expectations mismatch. We encourage jobseekers to visit WSG's Careers Connect or NTUC's Employment and Employability Institute (e2i)’s career centres for assistance. They can also use MyCareersFuture portal to find jobs best suited to their skills.Compared to males, a larger proportion of women looking for jobs cited the lack of flexible work arrangements (FWAs) as a challenge. This is likely because women still tend to take on more care-giving roles. It is our key priority to support women in their family and career aspirations. MOM introduced the Tripartite Standard on FWAs to encourage more employers to offer FWAs. MOM also provides funding support, through the Work-Life Grant, of up to $105,000 per company for the sustained adoption of FWAs. Like their male counterparts, self-employed females may be subject to payment disputes and loss of income in the event of prolonged illness or injury. Since March last year, self-employed persons are able to seek help from the voluntary mediation services provided under the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM). This is part of the recent Tripartite Workgroup's recommendations which also encourage the adoption of the Tripartite Standard on Contracting with self-employed persons that can minimise such disputes. We have also made available prolonged medical leave insurance products for the self-employed to enhance their health protection. MOM is committed to helping our women return or stay in the workforce and will continue to work with our tripartite partners to achieve this aim."
more support for athletes who are about to retire from sports,"Ms Yip Pin Xiu asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) whether the Ministry will consider providing more support to athletes who are about to retire from sports as the transition out of high performance sports is difficult in many ways; and (b) what more can be done for these athletes, both mentally and professionally, to ease their transition from their careers as sportsmen to the workforce.","Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: We support our athletes on their journey of high performance sport, extending beyond their competitive stage in life into their retirement from competitive sports. To do so effectively, the Government partners other stakeholders in the sports eco-system. The Singapore Sport Institute (SSI) works with corporate partners under the spexBusiness Network to offer professional development opportunities, such as internships, apprenticeships, part-time and permanent positions with flexible work arrangements, as well as mentorship and advice on starting a business, to prepare our athletes for a post-sports career. The Network also organises career-readiness workshops and networking opportunities with corporate partners. Athletes who need career advice and support on other well-being issues can also approach SSI, which oversees athlete life management matters.Many corporates have stepped forward to support our athletes, and we hope to see more doing so. The spexBusiness Network currently comprises 60 companies across more than 25 industries to provide a wide array of career opportunities to our Team Singapore athletes. Since 2013, 230 former and current Team Singapore athletes have benefitted from the spexBusiness, including (i) former shuttler Derek Wong who took on a full-time position at Deloitte, (iii) former sprinter Calvin Kang who started a sports-related business, and (iii) para-swimmer Sophie Soon who is now on a flexi-work arrangement with Toyota Asia, following her internship at Sport Singapore. Some of our National Sports Associations (NSA) have also instituted programmes of their own, such as the Singapore Table Tennis Association (STTA) which has bursaries and arrangements with Institutes of Higher Learning (IHL) to support their athletes to transition to a post-sport career. I would like to encourage more NSAs to support their athletes in this regard. The Government's sustained investment in sports over the past years has led to a more developed and vibrant local sports ecosystem. This has in turn provided more prospects for retired athletes to pursue a career in sports that they are passionate about. Many former national athletes have successfully made the transition to coaching, including in our ActiveSG sports academies, and they continue to contribute to the development of a Sporting Singapore by mentoring the next generation of athletes."
guidelines for teaching staff in dealing with situations involving parents of children who are divorced or are undergoing divorce,Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Education (a) whether there are standard operating procedures or guidelines for teaching staff in dealing with situations involving parents of children who are divorced or are undergoing divorce; (b) whether there are specific guidelines for situations where there are disagreements or disputes between parents in respect of the arrangements for the child in school; and (c) whether there is training for the teaching staff to guide them to handle such situations.,"50 Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Education whether there are guidelines for teaching staff to handle problems arising from the Parents Gateway mobile app being accessible by both parents, such as disputes between parents relating to the arrangements for their child. Mr Ong Ye Kung: It is difficult for schools and teachers to get deeply involved in family matters. Hence, schools will generally work on the basis that both parents are entitled to receive information in respect of a student; that any decision conveyed by one parent reflects the views held by both parents; and any school information sent home with the student or given to one parent at school, would be communicated to both parents.If schools find out that a student's parents are undergoing divorce or have already divorced, their key consideration will be the child’s well-being and best interests. Disagreements or disputes between parents can impact their child's emotional state and, thus, his or her ability to learn in school. Therefore, schools will usually encourage parents to set aside their personal differences and work towards a compromise or consensus. Where schools are made aware of any court orders made in respect of a student, such orders will be taken into account in subsequent engagements with the respective parents. Parents Gateway is a mobile application that was officially launched at the start of this year as part of MOE's on-going efforts to support our schools in their communication and engagement efforts with parents on their children's educational journey. Its design is also consistent with the approach I had stated earlier.   I am not sure that a set of rigid rules or protocols is the best way forward because every child from a broken family is surrounded by unique circumstances, and oftentimes educators will find themselves caught between parents, grandparents and other relatives. Educators will have to exercise judgement and manage each case sensibly and carefully. By abiding to the approach I mentioned, and with experience and support from their fraternity, educators will become better at handling these issues with time."
ratio of allied educators to students,"Ms Yip Pin Xiu asked the Minister for Education (a) what is the current ratio of allied educators (AEDs) to students in each school; (b) what are the types of training and resources made accessible to these AEDs; (c) in 2018, how many students required the help of an AED and how were these students identified; and (d) whether the Ministry has plans to increase the number of AEDs in our schools.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: The number of Allied Educators (AEDs) is currently about 2,000. Our AED force includes School Counsellors (SCs), Student Welfare Officers (SWOs), AEDs for Learning and Behavioural Support [AEDs(LBS)], and AEDs in Teaching and Learning [AEDs(T&L)] in mainstream schools. On average, each school has a team of one SC, and one to two AEDs(LBS). Some schools have an additional SWO to support students with irregular attendance. AEDs have been a great help in supporting socio-emotional, counselling, and special educational needs (SEN) of our students. In terms of training and resources, all our SCs are trained in the Diploma in School Counselling or Masters in Counselling, and all our AEDs(LBS) undergo the Diploma in Special Education training. Students with social and emotional issues may approach the SCs for help on their own, or are referred by their parents, teachers, or peers who have observed signs of distress or other concerns. Schools target the support provided by AEDs(LBS) to students with SEN based on the level of needs. Last year, SCs and AEDs(LBS) had attended to about 67,000 students, or about 15% of our student population, for a range of needs.  MOE will continue to recruit and train AEDs to meet students' needs. But the aggregate number of AEDs is less important than focusing our AED resources on areas where students need the most support. Hence MOE has consciously grown specific groups of AEDs to provide stronger specialised support, while scaling back on the number of AEDs(T&L) to reshape our workforce to deliver optimal educational outcomes for our students. In fact, a number of AEDs(T&L) have been selected to be retrained as AEDs(LBS) by taking up the Diploma in Special Education.Over the last five years, we have grown the number of AEDs(LBS) by over 40%. In recent years, we had also increased the number of SCs, and introduced more SWOs to provide greater support for students who struggle with attendance issues. MOE intends to announce a more detailed plan in the near future on how we will better support the students in our schools who need the most help."
percentage of singapore prison officers offered re-employment,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is the percentage of Singapore Prison officers re-employed at retirement; (b) what is the average length of re-employment; (c) whether there are adjustments to wages and benefits for the re-employed officers; and (d) how can trained prison officers be re-deployed at retirement to manage lock-up or remand duties within the other Home Team agencies.,"Mr K Shanmugam: In the last five years, about 20% of retired Prison Officers were re-employed. Their re-employment contracts range from one to three years, which may be renewed depending on organisational needs. For those officers whom Prisons is unable to re-employ because of headcount constraints, Prisons helps them look for suitable job opportunities. The Home Team Career Transition Office also organises regular career advisory sessions for officers to network with potential employers. Officers are provided with time-off and subsidies to attend training to enhance their employability, and to participate in employer attachment programmes. Through these efforts, some Prison officers have successfully secured second careers within and outside the Home Team, such as the Industrial and Services Cooperative Society, halfway houses and in the healthcare and social service sectors. Currently, officers re-employed under the Home Affairs Uniformed Scheme (HUS) get a three percent pay cut to their last drawn salary.   We have recently reviewed this guideline. From 1 April 2019, officers will be paid the last drawn salary if they are re-employed in the same level job in the HUS scheme.  On the other hand, if a HUS officer is re-employed in a civilian role or deployed to a smaller job, the salary will have to be adjusted accordingly.  All re-employed officers are eligible for wage components such as performance bonus and annual increment, as well as benefits such as vacation leave, medical care and training. These terms are consistent with the re-employment guidelines for the Public Service."
skillsfuture courses for seniors to attend with younger family members,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Education whether the Ministry will consider drawing up a list of SkillsFuture courses for seniors whereby they can attend with one younger family member to help them in their learning journeys.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: There is a wide range of affordable courses designed specifically for seniors, including IT courses at various levels of proficiencies, and learning opportunities under the National Silver Academy (NSA) offered by community-based organisations and Institutes of Higher Learning. Many of these courses are delivered by experienced adult educators who can cater to the learning needs of seniors. Selected NSA courses are offered in various vernacular languages, and we are prepared to run more of such courses if there is demand.  NSA courses also include inter-generational learning programmes that pair students with senior learners, to teach seniors various topics such as IT, social media, e-payment, accessing government digital services, staying safe online and photography. Family members who wish to accompany their seniors are welcome – either as a pairing partner in place of the students, or to attend the courses as fellow course participants. For seniors who have specific learning needs that require further assistance, family members may approach training providers to discuss the most appropriate form of learning support, including being accompanied by a family member when necessary."
government support for employers to encourage healthy lifestyle activities among employees,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Government can incentivise and support employers to encourage their employees to take part in meaningful exercises every day for the long-term health benefit of employees.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: There are existing initiatives to support employers in getting their employees to adopt healthier and more active lifestyles.  The Workplace Safety and Health Council (WSHC) works with the Health Promotion Board (HPB) to promote the Total Workplace Safety and Health approach. Under Total WSH, safety and health initiatives are integrated at the workplace. The WSHC and HPB provide incentives to employers to conduct health screenings, help workers to manage health conditions, promote ergonomic techniques for lifting loads, and institute workplace exercise programmes. Examples of programmes that support workplace exercise are HPB's SME Health+ and Workplace Alliance for Health schemes. They provide co-funding of up to 70% for SMEs and up to 50% for non-SMEs, for workplace exercise programmes conducted by HPB's pre-approved providers. HPB's National Steps Challenge, which encourages participants to accumulate at least 10,000 steps a day and 150 minutes of physical activity per week, also features a corporate component.We will continue to regularly review our initiatives to support employers in encouraging their employees to adopt healthier and more active lifestyles."
complaints regarding use of images without permission on social media platforms,"Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is the total number of complaints received in the past three years regarding the use of images without authorisation or permission on social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook and Snapchat; and (b) whether there are any plans to enact laws to regulate such use when images are misappropriated and used to offend or insult the modesty of a woman in light of the emergence of accounts like SgJCBabes.","Mr K Shanmugam: The unauthorised use of images per se is not a criminal offence. Police do not track the number of such cases. However, depending on the contents of the images and how they are used, the person may be committing an offence of insulting the modesty of a woman under section 509 of the Penal Code.Even where no Penal Code offence has been uncovered, if the images cause the victim harassment, alarm or distress, the victim can apply for a Protection Order under the Protection from Harassment Act for the images to be taken down. The victim can also lodge a Magistrate's Complaint to seek redress or compensation."
government action to reduce number of stateless residents in singapore,"Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is the number of stateless residents living in Singapore as of January 2019; (b) out of this group of residents, how many are stateless permanent residents; and (c) what is the Government's roadmap to help this shrinking group of residents to attain their citizenship.","Mr K Shanmugam: As at 31 December 2018, there were 1,303 stateless persons living in Singapore. 80% of them are Permanent Residents (PRs). Some of these stateless persons came from other countries to live and work in Singapore, and lost their foreign citizenship over time. Others were born in Singapore but were not eligible for Singapore Citizenship (SC) at birth as their parents were not Singapore Citizens and did not obtain citizenship for their children from their home country.Stateless persons can acquire SC on the same basis as other applicants. They will need to meet the relevant requirements, such as economic contribution, education qualification, family profile and length of stay in Singapore."
update on status of digital tv (dtv) conversion,Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) whether he can provide an update on the status of the digital TV (DTV) conversion till date including key learning points from this exercise; and (b) what are the challenges raised by households who have yet to switch to DTV and what kind of assistance will be available to these households.,"Mr S Iswaran: On 1 January 2019, we switched off analogue free-to-air signals, and transitioned fully to Digital TV or DTV. Today nine in ten Singaporean households can watch DTV, either over the air or through their Pay TV subscriptions. Based on outreach by the Info-communications Media Development Authority or IMDA, the remainder have not switched over primarily because they do not have TVs or they already have access to free-to-air TV through other means such as Toggle. This was not an easy transition. We had to reach out to more than 540,000 households to migrate them to DTV, and work with Mediacorp to install a nation-wide DTV broadcasting network. The smooth migration was made possible by an intensive outreach campaign led by IMDA, which helped 416,000 households, or 77% of eligible households, to switch over to DTV through the DTV Starter Kit programme launched in April last year. I would also like to thank agencies, grassroots advisors and the more than 2,000 volunteers for helping us through this exercise.Although we have crossed over fully to DTV, we recognise that there are some households which may not yet have switched over. IMDA has therefore extended the DTV Starter Kit application deadline to 31 March 2019 to help eligible households through this transition. IMDA will also continue advising other households how to switch to DTV, and work with Mediacorp to provide technical support to households."
encouraging employment of ite graduates in energy and petrochemical sector,Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked the Minister for Education (a) how many ITE graduates who took courses related to the energy and petrochemical sector found employment in this sector; (b) how accessible are internship opportunities for ITE students; (c) how are Government agencies working with ITE to help more Singaporeans obtain long-term employment in this sector; and (d) what is the status of the enrolment of courses run by the International Trading Institute of Singapore Management University.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: Based on the Graduate Employment Survey (GES), six in 10 graduates from courses related to the energy and petrochemical sector are in full-time permanent employment six months after graduation or six months to a year after completing national service. Amongst them, six in 10 are in jobs related to their course of study.  This is not surprising, as it is common for students to apply what they learnt at ITE to other sectors. Having said that, ITE works with the industry and various Government agencies to help the graduates secure employment in the sector they are trained for. All ITE students in courses related to the energy and petrochemical sector are required to undergo internship. ITE also reviews the curriculum of its courses regularly to ensure their industry relevance and currency of the skills taught.For example, ITE's Nitec in Chemical Process Technology is jointly developed with the Economic Development Board (EDB) and its industry partners.  The International Trading Institute (ITI) at the Singapore Management University (SMU) runs courses in the International Trading track and Maritime Business Operations track. These are offered through SMU's Lee Kong Chian School of Business. More than 740 students have enrolled in these courses since they were first launched in 2006."
compensation for nsmen injured during in-camp training,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Defence for NSmen who have been injured during in-camp training, exercises or other Operationally Ready National Service (ORNS) duties (a) what is the length of time for which SAF will provide medical treatment or reimbursement for civilian medical treatment; and (b) how does SAF compensate injured NSmen for loss of earnings where medical treatment or medical leave is extended beyond the call-up days under their SAF100.","Dr Ng Eng Hen: For all NS men with service related injuries, MINDEF pays for all necessary medical expenses at government restructured hospitals, clinics and community hospitals for as long as required for the injured serviceman. This includes the costs of medical supplies and equipment, counselling and specialist care. MINDEF's framework for service injury is more comprehensive and generous than provisions specified under the Work Injury Compensation Act (WICA), which pays for up to one year of medical expenses from the date of the accident or capped at $36,000, whichever is reached earlier.Further, MINDEF will also compensate injured NSmen for their loss of earnings as a result of any medical or hospitalisation leave, up to a period of two years from the last day of the call-up. Again this is more generous than the WICA where compensation for loss of earnings is up to a year from the date of the accident. For training-related incidents, compensation for the injured serviceman is also more generous than amounts specified by the Work Injury Compensation Act for the same degree of permanent disability sustained, as MINDEF's compensation is doubled . Finally, financial assistance is also provided for the families of selected injured servicemen through MINDEF's welfare schemes."
facilitating hassle-free compensation by singapore-based airlines to travellers for significant flight delays,Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry will consider introducing regulations to facilitate hassle-free compensation by Singapore air operators to airline travellers for significant flight delays.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: When airlines encounter aircraft technical issues or face inclement weather, they would have to delay their flights to resolve the issues safely and comprehensively. In Singapore, the interests of air passengers affected by flight delays are safeguarded under a national consumer protection framework. The responsibilities of airlines to their travelers in the event of flight delays are stated in their Conditions of Carriage. Consumers are advised to read and understand their rights and the airline's obligations before making any purchase.  If consumers feel that airlines have not fulfilled their responsibilities on service recovery and compensation, they can take up the matter with airlines. They can also seek assistance from the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) or lodge a claim with the Small Claims Tribunal. In Singapore's competitive air transport market, airlines have an interest to promptly and effectively respond to customers' needs and expectations on service quality.  The Ministry of Transport will continue to review the adequacy of consumer protection policies in the air transport market."
treatment of proceeds from lease buyback scheme,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry asked the Minister for National Development in respect of HDB's Lease Buyback Scheme (a) whether the flat owner is required to use the proceeds to return the CPF amount used to purchase the flat before the net proceeds are used to top up the owner's CPF Retirement Account; and (b) whether HDB will consider allowing flat owners in need to receive half of the proceeds from the Lease Buyback Scheme in cash.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: There is no need for seniors who take up the Lease Buyback Scheme (LBS) to refund the CPF monies they had used to purchase the flat. Instead, the LBS proceeds are first used to meet a basic level of CPF Retirement Account savings. Any remaining amount can then be taken out in cash. This ensures that seniors are able to benefit from a lifelong income stream under CPF LIFE.  Most seniors who take up the LBS are able to meet this CPF top-up requirement and still receive some of their LBS proceeds in cash. On top of this, they also receive the LBS bonus in cash.HDB conducts personalised face-to-face counselling sessions for seniors who are interested in the LBS or other housing monetisation options. Seniors are encouraged to make an appointment with their HDB Branch to find out more, so that they can make an informed decision about which option is best for their specific needs and circumstances."
second five-year extension of coe for vehicles in good condition,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry will allow a second five-year extension of the Certificate of Entitlement if the vehicle is in good condition and has a track record of proper maintenance.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: For cars and motorcycles, the validity period for renewal COEs is aligned with new COEs, to ensure that owners of new and renewed vehicles pay the same COE for owning vehicles in the same category.As an exception, LTA provides a five-year renewal option as a special concession to vehicle owners who would like to renew their COEs but feel that their vehicles may not last beyond another five years. This allows them to pay a smaller COE premium at the point of renewal. Vehicle owners are informed that the condition for the five-year renewal is that these vehicles must be deregistered at the end of five years, and no further renewals will be allowed. This is to prevent speculative activities where owners renew for shorter periods in the hope that COE prices will be lower in five years' time."
community housing solutions for just-released prisoners,"Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) in the past three years, how many inmates who are released from prison have homes to return to; (b) what solutions are there for those who do not have a place to stay; and (c) whether the Ministry works with the Singapore Prison Service to coordinate interim housing for former inmates.","Mr K Shanmugam: The vast majority of inmates who are released from prison have homes to return to. For inmates who do not have a place to stay after their release, the Family Resource Centre at the Singapore Prison Service will refer them to interim housing options, such as halfway houses and shelter homes. In the past three years, around 850 such referrals were made. This represents about 3% of the total number of inmates released."
promoting career opportunities in energy and petrochemical sector,"Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what are the demographics of the employees, including gender breakdown, in the energy and petrochemical sector; (b) what are the life-long learning opportunities in this sector; and (c) what is the Ministry doing to encourage more young Singaporeans to take an interest in this sector.","Mr Chan Chun Sing: The Energy & Chemicals (E&C) industry contributes about 3% of our Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employs about 28,000 people in 2017, with the majority in their 30s and 40s, a PMET to non-PMET split of about 3:1, as well as a male to female split of about 2:1. As our industries upgrade and transform, the Government is also making concerted efforts to help equip our workforce with the relevant skills to address the evolving needs of the industry. The Skills Framework for E&C was jointly developed by SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG), Workforce Singapore (WSG) and EDB, in collaboration with the industry, education and training institutions as well as unions. It provides key information about the sector, including career pathways, occupations and job roles, as well as existing and emerging skills required for our workforce to deepen their competencies. It also provides a corresponding list of training programmes for skills upgrading and mastery.In addition, the Government is also investing in new training programmes by developing niche capabilities modules with our Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs). For example, the advanced diploma in Specialty Chemicals launched by Singapore Polytechnic in 2017, complementing the other suite of programmes in ITE College East, Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Nanyang Polytechnic and Temasek Polytechnic. To attract young talent to join the E&C industry, the Chemical Industry Manpower Advisory Committee (Chimac), co-chaired by the Economic Development Board (EDB) and Singapore Chemical Industry Council (SCIC), have been organising outreach programmes for schools, polytechnics and universities. One example is the ""Chemical Experience Day"" which exposes students to the working environment on Jurong Island and provides a glimpse into a day in the industry. On the Government’s part, four SkillsFuture Earn and Learn Programmes (ELP) have been launched for job roles such as process technicians and laboratory analysts. The ELP is a work-learn programme that provides polytechnic and ITE fresh graduates opportunities to build on the skills and knowledge that they have acquired in school. As of December 2018, 134 trainees have been placed in 23 E&C companies. The growth of the E&C industry requires the collective effort of Government, industry and unions as well as our workers. We will continue to work with the various industry stakeholders to attract and equip our workers with the relevant skill sets to participate in the next phase of the E&C industry."
campaign to guide seniors on proper eye care and exercises,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry will consider a campaign to guide our seniors on proper eyesight care and exercises that can prevent dizziness which is a common cause of falls.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Seniors fall for a variety of factors, such as poor eyesight, decreased lower body strength and dizziness. MOH's efforts on fall prevention comprise both broad-based upstream prevention campaigns and outreach efforts as well as targeted interventions for those at higher risk of falls. Let me cite some examples.The Health Promotion Board (HPB) has worked with community partners to raise awareness on falls prevention. HPB started a Falls Prevention Awareness Campaign in 2016 to provide seniors with tips to reduce the risk of falls. A guidebook was released containing information on fall prevention strategies such as wearing non-slip footwear and ensuring adequate calcium intake. The guidebooks were distributed through more than 300 touchpoints including Community Clubs and Centres, retail pharmacies, polyclinics and hospitals.  HPB also conducts regular health talks at Community Clubs and Centres, and Residents’ Committees, advising on falls prevention and on good eye care. Over 70,000 seniors have benefitted from these talks over the past two years. In addition, HPB conducts exercise programmes to encourage seniors to build up muscle strength and balance to minimise their risk of falls. As part of their outreach efforts, Silver Generation Ambassadors (SGAs) conduct simple assessments of seniors’ health status during home visits. SGAs may refer seniors to relevant services such as HDB's Enhancement for Active Seniors (EASE) programme which subsidises home modifications such as anti-slip treatment for tiles and installation of grab bars to prevent falls at home. Seniors may also be linked up with service providers for care and support services. Most recently, MOH worked with Temasek Foundation Cares to launch Project Silver Screen, a nationwide functional screening programme for seniors to check their vision, hearing and oral health. As part of the screening, seniors are advised on proper eye care, and those with abnormal vision results are referred to an optometrist or eye specialist if needed. Since January 2018, more than 40,000 seniors have benefitted from Project Silver Screen, and about one in three seniors were referred for follow-up care. MOH and the healthcare family will continue to strengthen our efforts to reduce the risk of falls among our senior population."
average number of visits to polyclinics by elderly persons and basis for setting withdrawal limits for healthcare schemes,"Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Health (a) in the past two years, what is the annual average number of times an elderly person above 60 years of age visits a polyclinic or CHAS clinic for outpatient or specialist treatment; (b) what is the basis for setting the MediSave withdrawal limit at $500 per year for outpatient treatment under the Chronic Disease Management Programme and $200 withdrawal limit per year under Flexi-MediSave for the elderly; and (c) whether a higher MediSave withdrawal limit can be set for outpatient treatment by elderly patients based on their MediSave savings.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: In the past two years, elderly patients above 60 years of age with chronic conditions visited polyclinics and Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) clinics an average of six times per year, with an average annual bill of about $200 after subsidies. Those without chronic illnesses visited these healthcare facilities an average of about three times a year, with an average annual bill of about $60 after subsidies.  MediSave withdrawal limits are reviewed regularly, taking into account other healthcare financing schemes, and seeking to strike the right balance between present consumption of MediSave and its use as savings for future use. The MediSave withdrawal limits are sized so that outpatient care remains affordable, after subsidies. Arising from our recent reviews, we increased the MediSave CDMP limit from $400 to $500, and lowered the minimum age for Flexi-MediSave to 60 in June 2018.  These limits are adequate for the majority of patients at polyclinics and CHAS clinics. Any appeals for higher withdrawals, including for elderly patients, can be considered on a case-by-case basis, especially where the bill size is high. For patients who require additional financial support, they can be referred to the Medical Social Workers to consider assistance from MediFund.  Any liberalisation of MediSave withdrawals, including having higher withdrawal limits based on MediSave balances, will have to be carefully considered as it may result in Singaporeans having less MediSave savings when they are retired and older, which is when they are most likely to have a need for their MediSave savings the most. MOH will continue to monitor the affordability of subsidised care, and regularly review the financing policies, including MediSave withdrawal limits."
"proposal for developers, building owners and hdb to provide enclosed smoking rooms","Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether the Ministry will mandate developers, building owners and HDB to provide enclosed smoking rooms or pavilions in a precinct/HDB cluster, similar to what is provided in some airports and Japan, for smokers to smoke within the room and ensure that the smoke will not get into common areas affecting non-smokers.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Smoking facilities such as smoking rooms and pavilions cannot completely eliminate the risks of exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke. Tobacco smoke contains pollutants that can seep out of these facilities.Smoking facilities are also likely to become congregation points for smokers. As our housing estates are well-connected and densely built-up, it may be challenging to find appropriate locations for such facilities. Moreover, the daily sight of smokers gathering at smoking facilities could inadvertently give our youth the impression that it is normal to smoke. We want to avoid this, and therefore have no plans to mandate the provision of smoking facilities in residential precincts or housing clusters.Our approach to protecting residents from second-hand smoke has been to progressively extend the smoking prohibition to as many public areas as possible. Within housing estates, these include places such as sheltered walkways, exercise areas, playgrounds, and common areas of residential buildings such as void decks and lift lobbies. The National Environment Agency will continue to monitor and enforce against smoking violations at these locations.We urge smokers to abide by the smoking prohibition, and strive to give up the habit for the benefit of their own health, their loved ones, and the community."
proposal for government to increase funding for special education schools,Mr Ong Teng Koon asked the Minister for Education whether the Ministry will consider increasing Government funding for Special Education (SPED) schools in order to expand the means test criteria for the scheme so as to help families cope with the educational expenses of raising children with special needs.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: Government funds Special Education (SPED) schools at significantly higher levels than the mainstream schools, so that they can meet the different and unique learning needs of their students. MOE also reviews funding for our SPED schools regularly with NCSS, taking into account manpower costs and the requirements of different special educational needs.Over the last few years, overall government funding for SPED schools have increased steadily, as funding per student is raised and more students are diagnosed with Special Educational Needs (SEN). Today, Government subsidises a substantial proportion of the cost of educating a student with SEN. Notwithstanding, the cost burden to lower income Singaporeans with children with SEN is still significant. To support them, we have a SPED Financial Assistance Scheme, which covers school fees, textbooks, uniforms and transport subsidies. Students on the scheme SPED FAS also qualify for the School Meals Programme, which subsidises the cost of meals in school. We had revised the income eligibility criteria for the scheme in 2018 so that more low income families would benefit. Schools are also provided funds to exercise discretion and extend support to those who some reason do not meet the eligibility criteria for SPED FAS.The Government will continue to work closely with the parent Volunteer Welfare Organisations (VWOs) running our SPED schools, to ensure that cost is not an impediment to access SPED schools."
assistance to hawker associations to eradicate nuisance of pigeons and crows at hawker centres,Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether NEA can provide more assistance to hawker associations to eradicate the nuisance of pigeons and crows at hawker centres.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Nuisance issues at hawker centres relating to pigeons and crows arise when birds are attracted to food remnants. To address this, government agencies such as the Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority (AVA) and National Environment Agency (NEA) work closely with hawkers, Hawker Associations, and Town Councils to implement preventive measures. These include public education and enforcement against pigeon feeding and littering, proper food waste management, and surveillance and bird management operations.  Other deterrent measures may also be implemented where required. These include the installation of bird spikes on building structures and beams to reduce perching opportunities, and nettings at the perimeter of hawker centres to prevent birds from entering. We will continue to work closely with stakeholders to manage bird nuisance issues. Hawker Associations which face difficulties with bird nuisance issues may approach NEA for support. Patrons also play an important role in contributing to the cleanliness of hawker centres, thereby reducing bird nuisance. I encourage all patrons to return their crockery and trays to the tray return points when they finish dining."
fires involving external industrial kitchen exhaust ducts installed in hdb commercial premises,"Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for National Development (a) in the last three years, what is the number of fires that have been reported involving external industrial kitchen exhaust ducts installed in HDB commercial premises; (b) what measures are being taken by HDB to ensure that these ducts are serviced properly and regularly based on the nature of usage; and (c) what is the number of cases where HDB has taken action against property owners for failing to comply with the mandatory and proper maintenance of these external ducts in the last three years.","Mr Lawrence Wong: From 2016 to 2018, there were a total of 10 fires that involved external kitchen exhaust ducts installed in HDB commercial premises. Operators of food establishments are required to comply with NEA's Environmental Public Health (Food Hygiene) Regulations and SCDF's Fire Code, both of which include requirements for operators to clean and maintain the exhaust systems. NEA and SCDF carry out inspections and will take action against cases of non-compliance. HDB issues annual advisories to all operators, advising them to carry out regular maintenance of their exhaust systems to comply with NEA and SCDF's requirements. Since October 2016, HDB has also required operators to submit their maintenance records at each tenancy renewal or transfer of property. Should operators fail to produce their maintenance records, HDB will withhold lease transfers and tenancy renewals. So far, operators have complied with this requirement, and HDB has not had to hold back the processing of any transfers or renewals."
take-up rate for parking.sg app,Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether he can provide an update on the take-up rate for parking.sg since its implementation in October 2017; (b) what is the app utilisation rate versus use of coupons; (c) whether there are plans to allow for other payment platforms such as PayNow apart from credit card; and (d) whether there are plans to promote the app to more drivers.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Since the app was launched on 1 October 2017, more than 550,000 unique vehicles and more than 60% of cars have used Parking.sg1. Motorists have initiated over 15 million parking sessions.The number of parking coupons sold, at 50,000 booklets in December 2018, is less than one-third of the 180,000 booklets a month when the app was launched. At the same time, the number of parking sessions motorists initiated on Parking.sg has more than tripled, from 300,000 at launch to more than 1.1 million a month at present.Drivers can pay for their parking sessions with their credit and debit cards. The team will continue to take in user feedback and improve the app. To raise the awareness of the app, government agencies have distributed flyers at locations frequented by motorists and advertised on social media."
prevalence of road accidents at newton circus and adjoining lanes,"Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Transport (a) over the past three years, what is the number of road accidents that have occurred at Newton Circus and its adjoining lanes; and (b) how can such road accidents be prevented with better road safety measures.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Between 2016 and 2018, the Traffic Police recorded an average of nine accidents per year at Newton Circus and its adjoining lanes.LTA is conducting works to further improve road safety in the area. These include new crossing facilities to ensure pedestrian safety, U-turn facilities at approaching roads to reduce the number of vehicles using the roundabout, and additional traffic signals so that vehicles entering the roundabout will have their own traffic phase. LTA and the Traffic Police will continue to monitor the situation at Newton Circus. We urge all users to play their part by exercising caution and consideration when using our roads."
update on episode where quartz was used for columbarium niches instead of marble,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources in respect of the supply of 8,600 quartz (instead of marble) niches when the niches were relocated from Mount Vernon Columbarium (a) whether NEA had verified that all contractual requirements have been fulfilled by the contractors during delivery/installation; (b) what punitive action will be taken against the contractors; and (c) whether the contractors are required to provide refunds or compensation where affected families do not accept a marble replacement.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The National Environment Agency (NEA) has relocated about 20,000 niches at Mount Vernon Columbarium Complex (MVC) to make way for the development of Bidadari Estate. As part of the support package for affected families, NEA offered to relocate the urn from MVC to a replacement niche at either Choa Chu Kang or Mandai columbarium, together with a marble plaque. These were offered on a goodwill basis at no cost to the affected families. NEA's offer was taken up by families for about 14,500 niches. The relocation of the urns was undertaken by the NEA-appointed contractor and witnessed by NEA officers, together with the respective families. The officers had also checked the plaques before installation. Visual inspections had not shown up differences as quartz plaques look similar to marble ones. When NEA was first alerted to the non-marble plaque material, NEA immediately investigated the matter and sent samples for laboratory tests. NEA found that samples from one batch of plaques were made of quartz, rather than marble. About 8,600 niches were affected.  For these 8,600 niches, the contractor had not delivered the goods in accordance to contractual requirements. NEA takes a serious view of this performance breach and has directed the contractor to replace the quartz with new marble plaques, unless the families choose to retain the existing plaques. The contractor will bear the costs required to make good on what should have been delivered. Pending the completion of the replacement works, NEA has withheld payments to the contractor. NEA will also be claiming against the contractor for any difference in price between the quartz and marble plaques. Learning from this incident, NEA has incorporated the requirement of laboratory verification for materials in future tenders.  The contractor has reached out to the affected families with the offer of a replacement marble plaque and re-installation at no cost to the family. NEA is closely monitoring the progress of the replacement works and will ensure that the contractor fulfils its contractual obligations."
flexibility for bus captains to meet bus service reliability framework requirements,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Transport (a) how much flexibility is there for bus captains to meet the requirements of the Bus Service Reliability Framework (BSRF) which aims to improve punctuality and reliability of bus services; and (b) what are the common complaints relating to BSRF by bus captains and commuters.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: We introduced the Bus Service Reliability Framework (BSRF) in 2016 to incentivise bus operators to improve the timeliness of bus arrivals. The framework is designed to strike a balance between achieving timely arrivals to minimise waiting times, and higher bus speeds to reduce journey times. The target arrival times are set as a range, to provide bus captains with some flexibility under different traffic conditions. Arrival times are also regularly reviewed, taking into account route length and historical traffic conditions. Bus operators which meet the targets are given incentives, of which a part is shared with the bus captains. I am happy to note that 337 out of 363 bus services assessed under the BSRF outperformed the targets in Q2 2018, resulting in more reliable bus services.Bus captains have provided feedback that the BSRF requirements cause them stress. To support bus captains in meeting the standards, bus operators provide training and deploy service controllers who remotely provide guidance. As a result of these efforts, the National Transport Workers' Union (NTWU) has observed that there are now fewer of such complaints from bus captains.  Commuters sometimes raise concerns that the BSRF has caused buses to travel at slow speeds even when there is no traffic, so as to avoid arriving ahead of schedule. LTA works closely with the operators to regularly review and optimise bus schedules. Commuters can also provide their feedback on specific bus services to LTA, which will take them into account during such reviews."
steps taken to promote adoption of children in singapore,"Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) in the past five years, how many applications for adoption of children under the Adoption of Children Act have been granted in favour of singles who are not biological parents of the adoptees; and (b) what further steps have been or will be taken to promote the adoption of Singaporean children.","Mr Desmond Lee: Between 2013 and 2017, there were, on average, about 15 sole applications per year by never-married, divorced or widowed persons to adopt a non-biological child. This amounted to about 5% of all adoption applications in a year. Some of these applicants were step-parents or relatives of the child. Most of these applications were granted by the Courts, based on the welfare of the child. The number of adoptions involving Singaporean children has dropped over the years. This trend reflects our lower fertility rates. There are fewer Singaporean children available for adoption than there are prospective adopters. Nevertheless, we still encourage prospective adopters to consider adopting, such as children who have been abused or neglected, and whose birth families, despite our best efforts to support them, are assessed to be unsafe or unable to care for the children. For couples who are able to love and provide for these children, we encourage them to contact any of the four MSF’s accredited agencies, including TOUCH Family Services, Lutheran Community Care Services, Fei Yue Community Services and Apkim Centre for Social Services, for an assessment of their suitability to adopt. Ultimately, the underlying principle of adoption is to find a loving family that is able to meet the child’s needs and committed to parenting responsibility."
recent accidents and enhancing road safety on west coast road at section between penjuru road and jurong town hall road,Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the number of accidents that have occurred over the past three years on West Coast Road (the section between Penjuru Road and Jurong Town Hall Road); and (b) how can such accidents be avoided with better road safety measures.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Between January 2016 and December 2018, the Traffic Police recorded 12 accidents along West Coast Road (the section between Penjuru Road, Jurong Town Hall Road and Teban Gardens). Existing road safety measures along that stretch of West Coast Road include integrated pedestrian crossings with countdown timers to allow pedestrians to cross safely, and road markings that remind/encourage motorists to slow down. Double white lines with raised reflective pavement markers are drawn along the middle of road sections that are near bus stops to prohibit overtaking. Safety bollards have also been installed at bus stops to protect the safety of waiting commuters. In addition, LTA is studying the implementation of additional traffic calming measures, such as centre dividers and bus-friendly humps, to reduce vehicle speeds and improve pedestrian safety. LTA and the Traffic Police will continue to monitor the situation along West Coast Road. We urge all road users to play their part and exercise caution and consideration when using our roads. "
tackling and punishing voyeurism cases,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Home Affairs with regard to voyeurism and revenge porn (a) whether the Government conducts studies on how other countries deal with the issue; (b) what measures is the Government considering to deal with the issue and to protect victims; and (c) whether there will be specific measures to protect minors.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The Penal Code Review Committee (PCRC) had looked into voyeurism, and the distribution of intimate images without consent. In coming up with its recommendations, the PCRC studied other countries' approaches, namely England, Wales, Scotland, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia. The PCRC has recommended to make it an offence to take, possess, distribute, or access voyeuristic images; and to distribute or to threaten to distribute intimate images. The PCRC has also recommended enhancing the punishments, and particularly when a victim of these offences is below 14 years of age.The Government has completed its public consultation on the PCRC's recommendations, and is studying the feedback. We will announce our response on the various issues within the next couple of months."
singapore buildings’ maximum tolerance against wind and earthquake tremors,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development what is the maximum wind speed and magnitude of earthquake tremors that buildings in Singapore can withstand.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Buildings in Singapore have to be designed according to the relevant building codes. Buildings are generally designed to withstand a maximum wind gust speed of up to 143 kilometres per hour. This is more than sufficient to cater to the wind gust speeds locally. Singapore is not located in an earthquake zone. The nearest earthquake fault zone is located in Sumatra, more than 400 kilometres away. Over such a long distance, the seismic waves would have dissipated and lost most of their energy. Nevertheless, our buildings are designed to be sufficiently robust to withstand forces generated by distant earthquakes. For example, while tremors from the magnitude nine earthquake in Aceh in 2004 could be felt in Singapore, there were no reports of structural damage to our buildings."
stricter alcohol limits for motorists,Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether the Ministry will consider introducing a stricter prescribed limit of alcohol in a motorist's blood or breath whilst driving or being in charge of a motor vehicle if the motorist is under the age of 21 years or a probationary driver.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The Traffic Police (TP) does not rely only on the prescribed alcohol limit, to determine whether a motorist has been drink-driving. A motorist will be deemed to have done so, as long as he has consumed alcohol and is unable to exercise control over his vehicle.TP also does not differentiate its treatment of drink-drivers, based on age or driving experience. Young drivers and drivers with probationary licences are not more likely than other drivers to drink-drive."
identifying and automatically blocking scam phone calls,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) whether the Ministry has studied technological solutions capable of identifying and automatically blocking (i) automated calls pretending to represent the authorities and other fraudulent automated calling schemes and (ii) text messages that solicit illegal lending, online gambling, or other illegal activities; and (b) whether the Ministry will direct telecommunications service providers to develop or deploy such protective technologies.","Mr S Iswaran: The Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA) is exploring the feasibility of technological solutions to block automated fraudulent calls and text messages promoting illegal activities. These include solutions adopted or being developed by other jurisdictions, such as verifying legitimate calling numbers. In general, such technologies are still nascent and their effectiveness has yet to be determined. IMDA is also working with the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Singapore Police Force to tighten the prepaid SIM card regime to prevent criminal syndicates from using prepaid SIM cards to carry out their criminal activities.Other stakeholders also play an important role in combating these calls and text messages. Our telecommunication service providers are assisting the Police to address scams and text messages that solicit illegal moneylending, online gambling, or other illegal activities. The public can also take steps such as reporting the originating number as spam and blocking it by using the spam filtering functions on their phones. More importantly, we must help educate our loved ones so that they do not fall prey to the illegal activities being promoted through such calls and text messages."
non-renewal for employment pass holders whose employers do not match mandatory salary increase,Mr Ang Wei Neng asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how many employment pass holders were not renewed in 2018 due to inability of employers to match the increased salary mandated by the Ministry; and (b) what are the criteria to establish the quantum of the increased salary when employment pass holders seek new renewal terms.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: Employers cancel or do not renew the Employment Passes of their staff for various reasons such as changes in employers' manpower plans or their inability to meet the revised EP salary criteria. Employers are not required to disclose their reasons for not renewing an EP holder. Hence, we do not know how many EP holders were not renewed due to the employer not wishing to match the prevailing salary criteria. The same EP qualifying salary applies to both fresh applications and renewals. We regularly update the EP qualifying salary, taking into account local salary progression. This is to ensure that while businesses have access to skilled foreign manpower to stay competitive and grow, local jobseekers are not excluded from consideration by employers because they earn higher wages."
ban sharks fin dishes at events organised by public service agencies,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Prime Minister (a) whether sharks fin is still being served at events organised by or for the public service; and (b) whether sharks fin will be served at future events organised by or for the public service.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing (for the Prime Minister): Public agencies abide by the procurement principles of fairness, transparency and value-for-money. Agencies decide on their respective menus based on what is prudent and appropriate for the occasion. We do not have policies specific to the serving of shark’s fin. "
percentage of recipients under silver support scheme who are women,Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the current percentage of recipients under the Silver Support Scheme who are women; and (b) what is the amount of the quarterly payout to women who benefit from the scheme as compared to men.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: In 2018, about 148,000 elderly received Silver Support payouts and 65% of them were females. The median quarterly payout was $600 for both female and male recipients. This amount corresponds to the Silver Support payout quantum for eligible elderly living in a three-room HDB flat. "
sports and arts programmes to replace weighted exams for primary 1 and 2 students,"Mr Terence Ho Wee San asked the Minister for Education (a) in view of the removal of all weighted assessments and exams for Primary 1 and 2 students in 2019, what is the Ministry's plan for the students; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider implementing compulsory CCA and interest-based programmes for Primary 1 and 2 students, especially in the areas of sports and performing arts.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: Since 2011, newly admitted Primary school students take their first examination at the end of P2. Pre-school to primary school is a significant transition, and a substantial period free of examinations will help students to adapt and adjust to a new learning environment. This arrangement has worked well for students. From 2019, MOE will further remove all weighted assessments for P1 and 2, including P2 year-end examination. Sports and arts education are core components in our national curriculum. In total, about one-quarter of the curriculum time at the lower primary level is devoted to arts and sports education. Within this allocated time, in addition to art, music and physical education lessons, P1 and P2 students also go through the Programme for Active Learning, which provides students with broad exposure to Sports and Games, Performing and Visual Arts, and Outdoor Education. The Programme has been designed to develop socio-emotional competencies in the students, help them discover their strengths and interests, and prepare them to choose a co-curricular activity when they progress to higher primary levels. We want our students to be curious and confident in learning, as opposed to being driven by examinations and grades from a young age. As such, schools will use the curriculum time freed up from examinations and weighted assessments to pace out teaching and learning, and adopt a wider repertoire of teaching strategies that provide students with rich and meaningful learning experiences. Such engagement in learning will prepare them better for lifelong learning."
plan to address psychosocial and mental health needs of care-givers,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Health (a) whether there is an impending national care-giving plan to address the complex challenges in this area; (b) whether the Action Plan for Successful Ageing, Enabling Masterplan and Community Mental Health Masterplan address the psychosocial and mental health needs of care-givers and, if so, how; and (c) what is the current percentage of healthcare spending on care-giving.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Care-giving needs will grow as our population ages, with one in four Singaporeans aged 65 and above by 2030. Guided by the Action Plan for Successful Ageing, MOH's approach towards supporting caregivers, includes expanding and deepening the range of care options available for their loved ones, so that care-givers can have peace of mind. To this end, we have added 2,600 day places and 2,300 home care places since 2015. We have also made respite care at nursing homes and eldercare centres more accessible so that care-givers can have a reprieve in care-giving. Overall, around $800 million was spent in 2016 on the long term care sector, which could help to meet these care-giving needs and to ensure that quality care is affordable and accessible.  Besides these efforts, other programmes are in place to support the psychosocial and mental health needs of care-givers. For example, community outreach and community intervention teams are available to provide care-givers with emotional support, psycho-social education and counselling, equipping them with more insights about their loved one's conditions and how they can be better supported. Care-giver support networks are also a valuable source of peer support and mutual help. In addition, support for care-givers of persons with disabilities has also been enhanced under the Third Enabling Masterplan. For example, SG Enable recently set up a 'Care-giver Pod' at the Enabling Village to facilitate peer support group activities and training, and to make it convenient for caregivers to access information, referrals to disability services and support. We have also seen ground-up initiatives, such as the Care-giving@Southwest programme recently launched by the Southwest Community Development Council in December 2018. The effort seeks to build community-wide awareness and recognition of caregivers and their care-giving needs, and brings together community partners to show collective support for care-givers. We want to encourage more of such ground-up local efforts, as part of a whole-of-society effort to support our care-givers. However, we recognise that more can be done. A review is presently being undertaken to look into strengthening support for senior care-giving. As part of the review, MOH has been engaging care-givers and other stakeholders to gather feedback and discuss ideas since September last year. Areas under review include improving care navigation in the community, enhancing care-giver support in areas such as respite services, and working with community partners to offer more socio-emotional support to care-givers. MOH and partner agencies are developing specific recommendations in these areas, and more details will be provided in due course."
timeline for resolving noise disturbance problem caused by birds in potong pasir,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for National Development whether AVA can provide a timeline for resolving the noise disturbance problem caused by birds in Potong Pasir since the matter was raised two years ago.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: A sustainable myna management strategy requires a holistic suite of measures, such as the removal of food sources made available by humans, habitat modification, and population control strategies. To this end, AVA and NParks have been working with the Jalan Besar Town Council to address the noise disturbance issue at Potong Pasir caused by Javan Mynas. NParks has regularly pruned trees in Potong Pasir to discourage the mynas from roosting in the affected areas. AVA has also worked with the Town Council to ensure proper food waste management, as the presence of improperly disposed food waste exacerbates the situation. AVA has also tried to move the birds away from trees near residential areas. For instance, in September 2017, AVA trialled the use of lasers to disperse the birds at Potong Pasir, but assessed that this is not a sustainable solution as the birds returned once the lasers were switched off. AVA has also conducted trials in other parts of Singapore, such as using natural bird repellent and passing low electrical currents through roost trees. However, these trials had limited long-term effects. AVA will continue to refine and assess other possible methods.The Javan Myna is not native to Singapore. It is an invasive bird species. If the mynas continue to roost in large numbers, they will pose a threat to native bird species as they compete for nesting and food resources, as well as cause hygiene and noise issues. Thus, there is a need to remove some birds in order for longer-term management measures to be effective. In this regard, AVA conducted a trial in Potong Pasir in December 2018 using roost nets to trap the mynas. This was adapted from a system developed by the Australian National University, where the roosting mynas are trapped while in the trees, and then euthanised in a controlled and humane manner. AVA is fine-tuning the method before considering wider deployment. In tandem, NParks is working with the Jalan Besar Town Council to undertake habitat modification measures to reduce the number of mynas roosting in the estate. First, trees in the estate will be pruned to make them less attractive as roost sites. This will be completed in January 2019. We expect the mynas to disperse to non-residential areas once the tree crowns are pruned. Second, to sustain this effect over the long-term, the current roost trees will be replaced with tree types that are less preferred by the mynas. These are trees with crowns that are less dense, but will still provide greenery and shade. Agencies will continue to work closely with the Jalan Besar Town Council to manage the myna situation at Potong Pasir. The public must also play its part by maintaining the overall cleanliness of the environment and not feeding wild birds.  "
blood donation rates compared to other countries and contingency measures for blood shortages,"Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked the Minister for Health (a) how does our resident population blood donor rate compare with other developed countries, such as South Korea, Germany and the US; (b) what contingency measures are in place for blood shortages; and (c) how will the Ministry ensure that blood donations keep up with increasing blood usage due to our ageing population.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Health Sciences Authority, or HSA, is responsible for providing a safe and adequate blood supply for our patients. It works closely with the Singapore Red Cross, or SRC, to recruit voluntary blood donors under the National Blood Programme. The SRC leverages its networks with companies, communities, hospitals, religious groups, schools and the uniformed groups to recruit blood donors.About 73,000 blood donors contributed to the blood programme in 2017, giving a donor participation rate of 1.8%. This is comparable to countries and cities in the Asia-Pacific region such as Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong, where donor participation rates range between 1.9% and 2.2%. Overall, our donor pool has been adequate to meet blood demand. Nevertheless, occasional blood shortages may arise especially during festive seasons or school holidays, when many blood donors travel overseas. In such a situation, the SRC will ramp up recall efforts through social media, text messages and direct donor calls. More mobile blood drives may also be set up across the island. During rare instances when blood stocks fall below a critical level, HSA may work with hospitals to postpone some non-urgent surgeries until the blood stocks improve. HSA and SRC may also launch an appeal for blood donations through the mass media. We have embarked on efforts to improve our outreach. For example, HSA has built satellite blood banks closer to where donors live, work or study. HSA and SRC have also focused on getting more young people to become regular blood donors. Frequent mobile drives are also set up at schools, polytechnics and universities. We encourage the community to volunteer to become regular blood donors, particularly as demand will increase over time."
higher workplace fatalities in construction industry in 2018,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what are the reasons of higher workplace fatalities in the construction industry in 2018 as compared to 2017; (b) what is the profile of the fatalities; and (c) what more can be done to reduce workplace fatalities in the construction industry.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: Construction workplace fatalities have been on the decline, from an average of 29 between 2009 and 2013 to an average of 21 between 2014 and 2018. It increased marginally from 12 in 2017 to 14 in 2018, reflecting the challenge of sustaining the improvements over the last decade.Falls from height remain the main contributor in recent years. The accidents were caused by either the lack of barricades over open sides, or by not using properly attached safety lines. There was a higher proportion of foreign workers with less than two years' experience in Singapore among the fatalities.Our existing approach to raise awareness on safety lapses while carrying out targeted enforcement has helped to reduce construction fatalities. We will continue to work with the WSH Council to raise safety and health awareness through campaigns, roadshows and events at dormitories. In 2018, we have reached out to around 50,000 construction workers to educate them on safety risks, especially from falls. We also share the learning points from recent accidents with the construction industry, including partners like the Singapore Contractors Association Limited. Safety training especially for less experienced foreign workers is crucial. This is why we have mandatory safety orientation training for new workers, conducted in eight languages. Refresher courses are also required every two years, with frequency reduced after six years of experience.In addition, MOM will sustain regular inspections. We conducted about 3,000 construction inspections last year, covering close to 70% of active construction sites. They resulted in 55 Stop-Work-Orders and 1,100 composition fines. Formed in Feb 2018, the WSH2028 Tripartite Strategies Committee has been discussing how we can improve our WSH outcomes. It is expected to release its recommendations in February 2019."
"initiatives with companies such as facebook for ""suicide watch"" intervention programmes","Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) how can the Ministry work with social media companies to help residents who are in distress or have suicidal tendencies; and (b) whether there are plans to develop initiatives with companies such as Facebook on ""suicide watch"" type of intervention programmes.","Mr Desmond Lee: Singapore adopts a whole-of-society, multi-pronged approach to address the complex nature of suicide. The Government and community partners work together to promote upstream prevention, encourage individuals to seek help, provide support to at-risk groups, and offer crisis support. Many of these efforts need to take place in person to be effective, while some are complemented by online efforts. For example, the Institute of Mental Health (IMH)'s Community Health Assessment Team (CHAT) has a drop-in centre at *SCAPE Youth Park and an online WebCHAT service for young persons in need of mental health support. The National Council of Social Service (NCSS) is running a multi-year public education campaign on mental health issues, called 'Beyond the Label'. Apart from making available information on where to seek help, a Facebook community page has also been set up as a safe space for the online community to share experiences and provide support to those in recovery. A key community partner is the Samaritans of Singapore or SOS, which provides programmes to train professionals and the public on how to identify suicide warning signs, which may be observed on social media, and on how to support the individual. The evidence for ""suicide watch"" interventions, which depend on the robustness of the computer algorithms, is currently unclear. There may also be concerns about data privacy and civil liberties, as automated actions may kick in once warning signs are picked up, regardless of whether the distress is real or inaccurately diagnosed. We will continue to review how we enhance our suicide prevention efforts in both physical and online spaces. "
calculation of cpf ordinary account (oa) interest rate,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether computation of the CPF Ordinary Account (OA) interest rate, based on indicative Singapore bank fixed deposit and savings rates, reflects the actual market interest rate for deposit accounts, given banks' widespread use of bonus interest rates linked to salary credits, etc; and (b) whether the Ministry will study alternative methods of CPF OA interest rate computation to reflect the actual average weighted interest rates earned on deposit accounts with Singapore banks and the implications thereof for retirement adequacy.","Mrs Josephine Teo: CPF interest rates are pegged to returns on investments of comparable risk and duration in the market. The Ordinary Account (OA) is a liquid account as the savings can be withdrawn at any time for home purchases. This is why the OA interest rate is pegged to the higher of (i) the three-month average of major local banks' interest rates or (ii) the legislated minimum interest of 2.5% per annum. As the computed rate based on the three-month average of major local banks' interest rates is 0.4% per annum, the current OA interest rate is 2.5% per annum for Q1 2019.Bonus rates given by banks are not comparable with CPF interest rates. The bonus rates are typically contingent on customers fulfilling other criteria such as minimum spending on credit cards, crediting of salary, or making bill payments through an account. The effective interest rate may be much lower because the bonus rates are usually capped to a certain amount. In other words, they are not uniformly applicable to all balances of all depositors.  Members may consider transferring their OA savings to the Special Account (SA) to earn a higher interest rate. Balances in the SA currently earn 4 – 6% per annum. In 2017, over 20,000 members transferred nearly $470 million into their SA."
inspection frequency for mature trees in parks,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the inspection frequency for mature trees located in our parks; and (b) whether there is a need for a review of the tree inspection regime in light of changing climatic conditions and recent incidents of tree failures causing injuries.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Trees in parks are inspected every 12 to 24 months, depending on their proximity to event spaces and car parks. Since 2016, NParks also does an additional, more in-depth annual inspection for trees of more than four metres in girth, to check for internal decay or cavities in these trees. NParks has also implemented other measures in light of changing climatic conditions. First, NParks replaces storm-vulnerable species with hardier trees. Second, NParks regularly prunes its trees to improve their structure and balance. In particular, since 2016, NParks has been conducting crown reduction and pruning prior to periods of more severe weather conditions. Third, NParks uses technology to analyse risks and improve inspection processes. For instance, NParks recently developed a Tree Structural Model to understand the impact of strong winds on the stability of trees. The data helps NParks determine the pruning required to improve tree stability.With this adaptive tree management programme in place, the annual number of tree failure incidents has fallen by about 85% from 3,000 in 2001 to about 400 in 2018, despite more severe weather. NParks will continue to review its tree management programme to ensure that it remains robust and comprehensive."
impact of smoking ban in orchard road on shopping experience there,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources since the implementation of the smoking ban in the Orchard Road area (a) how many smokers have been warned; (b) what has been the response of foreign visitors; and (c) what has been the impact on shopping experience in the Orchard Road area.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The Orchard Road No-Smoking Zone (NSZ) came into force on 1 January 2019, as part of the Government’s long term goal of achieving a smoke-free Singapore.  To date, about 2,200 verbal advisories have been issued daily by the National Environment Agency (NEA) to smokers for lighting up in the newly-prohibited areas. Smokers – including foreign visitors – have been generally receptive when advised by NEA officers about the new law. Most comply by smoking at one of the more than 40 Designated Smoking Areas located within the NSZ. NEA will maintain this advisory approach during the first three months of the prohibition, and will closely monitor the situation on the ground to ensure the NSZ is implemented smoothly. With the shopping belt and its main thoroughfare now smoke-free, we expect the overall shopping experience in Orchard Road to improve, as pedestrians can enjoy cleaner air and a healthier environment there."
gardasil vaccine not replaced with gardasil-9 vaccine in medisave claimable list,Ms Irene Quay Siew Ching asked the Minister for Health why the Gardasil vaccine is not replaced with the Gardasil-9 vaccine under the MediSave claimable list as the latter drug (launched since 2017) covers more strains of the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and increases overall cervical cancer prevention from 70% to up to 90%.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: There are currently three human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines available in Singapore – Cervarix, Gardasil, and Gardasil 9. In Singapore, HPV vaccination is recommended for females age nine to 26 years and MediSave use is extended for vaccinations using Cervarix or Gardasil. These two vaccines protect against HPV infection from two of the most common types (16 and 18), which account for 70% of cervical cancer cases, and have been shown to be both clinically- and cost-effective in the local setting.Gardasil 9 is a relatively new vaccine which potentially extends protection against additional cancer-causing HPV types. MOH is currently in the process of evaluating its cost-effectiveness, compared to the other HPV vaccines."
ensuring singapore's food security for key agricultural products,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for National Development (a) how has the Ministry sought to ensure Singapore's food security for key agricultural products over the last decade; and (b) how does it ensure that prices remain affordable without compromising on our food security.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The government adopts a multi-pronged approach to safeguard Singapore’s food security. First, diversification of our food import sources mitigates the impact of supply disruption from any one source. As part of our diversification efforts, the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) regularly organises and facilitates food sourcing activities, to help our industry players find alternative import sources. We bring in food from around 180 countries, and we are continuing to strengthen our diversification efforts. For instance, we accredited some farms in Thailand to supply hen shell eggs in 2017 and we are in the process of accrediting more this year. Second, we are transforming our agriculture sector to raise local production. In 2017, we launched the Farm Transformation Map to guide the long-term development of the sector. Since then, we have tendered out new agriculture land plots, mostly at fixed land prices, to enable tenderers to compete on productivity. We have already seen new innovative technologies and processes proposed by winning tenderers. We also enhanced the Agriculture Productivity Fund last year such that our farmers can get more funding support to purchase advanced technology and systems to optimise their production. Third, we are encouraging our local farms to internationalise and set up overseas presence. Apollo Aquaculture is an example of a local food fish farm that has expanded its operations to Brunei. Such farms can export their produce back to Singapore to enhance our food security.  Finally, government agencies are being reorganised to enable greater focus on food safety and security. We recently announced the setting up of a new statutory board called the Singapore Food Agency which will take over the food-related work currently being done by AVA, NEA and HSA. Tomorrow, we will be tabling the Singapore Food Agency Bill and the NParks (Amendment) Bill in Parliament to effect this organisational restructuring. As part of the legislative changes, we will also introduce requirements for importers of key food items to adopt plans, including preventive strategies, to mitigate the impact of food supply disruptions.  If and when there are external disruptions in supply, there will be some fluctuations in food prices and we have to be prepared for this. But on the whole, our strategies have strengthened food security, and ensured that Singaporeans have access to affordable and safe food options. This is why the Economist Intelligence Unit has ranked Singapore as the most food secure country in the world."

considerations for award of contract to school bus operators and proposal for fee guideline,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Education (a) how do schools decide on the engagement of school bus operators; (b) what are the main considerations for awarding a contract to school bus operators; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider issuing a fee guideline for school bus operators.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: Schools select school bus operators through a competitive bidding process and award contracts to the operators that best meet their needs. The competitiveness of bus fares proposed is one of the key evaluation factors considered by schools. Other factors include good track records and ability of bus operators to meet the needs of individual schools such as number and capacity of buses, and route coverage. Fares will vary among schools and students depending on routes and distances travelled, and number of students on a particular route. In January 2015, MOE enhanced the bidding process for school bus services so that schools can reach out to more bus operators to obtain more competitive offers. Schools publish the contracted bus fares of the successful school bus operators on the Information Notice Board for School Bus Services which is available on MOE's website. This serves as a reference and guide for schools in selecting the most suitable school bus operator which offers the best value for money.  As school bus services are customised to meet the needs of individual schools and parents, a specific fee guideline may not help schools in their selection for school bus operators. Moreover, it may discourage bus operators coming forward to bid for the services if there are many restrictions and conditions imposed on them. Therefore, it would be better to let school bus fares be determined by the market. The Government on its part has put in place measures to help school bus operators keep their operating costs low so that they can offer more competitive fares."
regulation of chiropractic industry,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Health (a) what regulatory guidelines or standards are applicable to the chiropractic industry; (b) whether customers of the industry will be able to find recourse from the Ministry when there are disputes; and (c) whether there is any ongoing process to bring the industry under further regulation such as to consider it as part of the Allied Health Professionals under the First Schedule of the Allied Health Professions Act.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: MOH takes a risk-based regulatory approach. Chiropractic services are a form of complementary and alternative treatment, and are currently not licensed under the Private Hospital and Medical Clinic Act. There is also no statutory legislation to regulate practitioners of complementary and alternative medicine practitioners, including Chiropractors. Chiropractors are encouraged to practise self-regulation, register with their professional association, that is, The Chiropractic Association (Singapore) and adhere to industry standards set by the association. TCA (Singapore) has developed a code of ethics, scope of practice and advertising guidelines for their profession.While there are no regulations involving chiropractors and its services, they are subjected to provisions under the Medicines (Sales and Advertisements) Act. For example, their publicity is not permitted to contain any diagnostic or treatment claims for any diseases and medical conditions. Doing so might contravene the Act, and result in penalties. Complaints in this area can be sent to MOH. For other disputes, customers can find recourse through the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE).The Ministry will continuously monitor the risk to patient safety and periodically review the need to license chiropractic professionals and its services."
subsidy level at polyclinics and restructured hospitals for patients with private insurance coverage for hospitalisation but not outpatient treatment,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Health (a) in each of the last five years, how many appeals have been received from patients asking for subsidised outpatient medical assistance at polyclinics and restructured hospitals though they have private insurance which covers only hospitalisation and not outpatient treatment; and (b) whether patients with private insurance coverage for hospitalisation but not outpatient treatment can still be allowed to receive subsidised medical treatment at both polyclinics and restructured hospitals.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Singaporeans can benefit from subsidised outpatient treatments at all our polyclinics and hospitals, regardless of their insurance coverage. All Singaporeans receive subsidised treatments at our polyclinics. As for our public hospitals' Specialist Outpatient Clinics (SOC), patients with valid polyclinic referrals and CHAS cardholders with valid CHAS clinic referrals, as well as patients discharged from B2 or C hospital wards, are eligible for subsidised medical treatments.Patients may opt for private SOC services or A or B1 wards for various reasons, including choosing specific doctor or taking advantage of private insurance coverage. Some of these patients may later request to switch to subsidised care due to financial concerns. Our public healthcare providers assess such requests on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration factors including the patient's financial circumstances. In the past five years, on average, we have received about 4,000 requests a year to switch from private to subsidised SOC care.Patients who are facing financial difficulties can approach the medical social workers to discuss available options."
applications received by community disputes resolutions tribunals and rate of resolution,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Law since February 2017 (a) how many applications have been received by the Community Disputes Resolutions Tribunals; (b) how many case have been resolved successfully; and (c) whether any of the parties have failed to observe the resolution granted by the tribunal resulting in the tribunal bringing the party concerned to task.,"Mr K Shanmugam: Between 1 February 2017 and 31 December 2018, the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals (CDRT) received 163 applications. Out of these, 133 claims have been disposed of, while 30 claims are still pending as of 31 December 2018. Out of the 133 claims which were disposed of, 97 claims were resolved amicably – Consent Orders were granted in 33 claims while the other 64 claims were either withdrawn or discontinued. As for the remaining 36 claims, the CDRT granted orders by default or after trial, or dismissed or struck out the applications. There have been a few instances where a respondent had failed to comply with the terms of an Order of the Tribunal. In these circumstances, and upon the application of the plaintiff, Special Directions have been issued against the respondents. A Special Direction is a direction by the Tribunal to the respondent to comply with the order that has been made against him within a specified time. 10 Special Directions were issued by the CDRT in the period between 1 February 2017 and 31 December 2018. A respondent who fails to comply with a Special Direction without reasonable excuse, commits an offence. He is liable on conviction to be fined up to $5,000 or imprisoned up to three months or to both."
review of singapore youth festival arts presentation,Mr Terence Ho Wee San asked the Minister for Education whether there will be a review of the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation and what is the participation rate and performing standards of past Festivals.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: Since its inception in 1966, the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) has played a crucial role in promoting the arts in our schools. MOE regularly reviews the SYF, and over the years, the format of the festival has been refined to meet changing needs. The current SYF Arts Presentation introduced in 2012, is designed to improve our students' appreciation of the performing arts and foster their joy of learning in and through the arts. Almost all our schools register consistent participation in the SYF Arts Presentation across the different art forms. Participation rate has remained steady over the last six years at 5 to 6% on years for primary and junior college/centralised institute level (Drama category) participation and 7 to 8% for secondary and junior college/centralised institute level participation. Feedback from our judges indicate that performance standards across various art forms have remained consistently positive. Since the introduction of the current format, results show that performing standards on the whole have been stable."
dispute between singaporean workers and employers when adopting flexi-wage system,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Manpower (a) in the past five years, how many cases of dispute have arisen between Singaporean workers and their employers when adopting the flexi-wage system; (b) what have been the reasons for the disputes; and (c) how does the Ministry ensure fair employment and remuneration practices by the employers in the implementation of the flexi-wage system.","Mrs Josephine Teo: In the past five years, MOM handled four trade disputes relating to flexible wage implementation. These disputes, which were all collective in nature, were due to disagreements over how variable bonuses were determined. Through MOM's conciliation efforts, these cases were eventually resolved with employers and unions mutually agreeing on the bonuses to be paid.MOM will continue to work with the tripartite partners to share best practices and industry norms so that flexible wages are implemented fairly and progressively."
waiving resale levy for households affected by sers when they buy replacement flat,"Ms Tin Pei Ling asked the Minister for National Development given that the Selective En-Bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS) is an involuntary scheme, whether the Minister will consider waiving the resale levy for households affected by SERS when they select a replacement flat.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Under SERS, households whose existing flat is a subsidised flat do not need to pay a resale levy when they buy a new replacement flat from HDB. This waiver of resale levy is a concession under SERS.The resale levy is payable only for SERS households who had previously sold a subsidised flat elsewhere and are liable to pay a resale levy should they buy another subsidised flat from HDB. The resale levy is capped at $30,000, as a concession under SERS. SERS households need not take up the replacement flat from HDB – they can instead opt for an ex-gratia payment and buy a resale flat on the open market, without the need to pay any resale levy."
incidents of fires in hdb flats in last three years,Dr Lily Neo asked the Minister for National Development (a) how many incidents of fires in HDB flats have there been in each of the last three years; and (b) what are the main causes of these fires.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Over the last three years, there has been an average of about 650 fire incidents reported per year in HDB flats. Fires in HDB flats are mainly due to unattended cooking, of electrical origin, or involve naked flames such as candles."
plan to address psychosocial and mental health needs of care-givers,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Health (a) whether there is an impending national care-giving plan to address the complex challenges in this area; (b) whether the Action Plan for Successful Ageing, Enabling Masterplan and Community Mental Health Masterplan address the psychosocial and mental health needs of care-givers and, if so, how; and (c) what is the current percentage of healthcare spending on care-giving.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Care-giving needs will grow as our population ages, with one in four Singaporeans aged 65 and above by 2030. Guided by the Action Plan for Successful Ageing, MOH's approach towards supporting caregivers, includes expanding and deepening the range of care options available for their loved ones, so that care-givers can have peace of mind. To this end, we have added 2,600 day places and 2,300 home care places since 2015. We have also made respite care at nursing homes and eldercare centres more accessible so that care-givers can have a reprieve in care-giving. Overall, around $800 million was spent in 2016 on the long term care sector, which could help to meet these care-giving needs and to ensure that quality care is affordable and accessible.  Besides these efforts, other programmes are in place to support the psychosocial and mental health needs of care-givers. For example, community outreach and community intervention teams are available to provide care-givers with emotional support, psycho-social education and counselling, equipping them with more insights about their loved one's conditions and how they can be better supported. Care-giver support networks are also a valuable source of peer support and mutual help. In addition, support for care-givers of persons with disabilities has also been enhanced under the Third Enabling Masterplan. For example, SG Enable recently set up a 'Care-giver Pod' at the Enabling Village to facilitate peer support group activities and training, and to make it convenient for caregivers to access information, referrals to disability services and support. We have also seen ground-up initiatives, such as the Care-giving@Southwest programme recently launched by the Southwest Community Development Council in December 2018. The effort seeks to build community-wide awareness and recognition of caregivers and their care-giving needs, and brings together community partners to show collective support for care-givers. We want to encourage more of such ground-up local efforts, as part of a whole-of-society effort to support our care-givers. However, we recognise that more can be done. A review is presently being undertaken to look into strengthening support for senior care-giving. As part of the review, MOH has been engaging care-givers and other stakeholders to gather feedback and discuss ideas since September last year. Areas under review include improving care navigation in the community, enhancing care-giver support in areas such as respite services, and working with community partners to offer more socio-emotional support to care-givers. MOH and partner agencies are developing specific recommendations in these areas, and more details will be provided in due course."
safeguarding welfare of detained youths in places of detention and juvenile rehabilitation centres,Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for Social and Family Development regarding youths residing in places of detention and juvenile rehabilitation centres established under the Children and Young Persons Act (a) how does the Government ensure that the conditions of detention or residence promote rehabilitation; (b) what oversight mechanism and grievance procedure exist to safeguard the welfare of the detained youths; and (c) whether past reviews of violent incidents in the Singapore Boys Home have identified any contributory factors for the occurrences.,"Mr Desmond Lee: The youth justice system in Singapore is broadly premised on a gradation of interventions. As far as possible, youth offenders are diverted away from the youth justice system altogether through diversionary programmes such as the Enhanced Streetwise Programme for youths who play a minor role in gang-related offences. Where they are brought before the Youth Courts, they are first considered for probation and rehabilitation outside of residential facilities. This is to prevent their development from being unduly disrupted. This means that the youths who are required to reside in places of detention and juvenile rehabilitation centres generally have higher-risk behaviours, complex needs or a weak family environment that does not support rehabilitation. At the Government-managed Singapore Boys' Home, our youth workers support youth offenders to strengthen their socio-emotional development and relationship with their family, develop their resilience, and improve their education and employment outlook. The daily regimes and programmes build character and life-skills in the youths. Formal education is also a key component of the Home's programme.   To provide a conducive rehabilitative regime, it is important to have good governance to ensure the well-being of the residents. There are stipulated standards of care, and a Review Board comprising professional volunteers appointed by the Minister which reviews the living conditions in the Home. Residents may raise concerns directly to members of the Review Board during their visits, or to the management of the Home. They may also deposit a letter into a secure letterbox that is accessed only by selected personnel. At the same time, MSF takes the safety of residents and of our staff seriously. Bearing in mind the risk profile of the youths, some friction among fellow residents in a communal setting is not unexpected. MSF works closely with the Home Team departments to learn from past incidents in order to strengthen our policies and processes. For example, MSF and the Police have strengthened activation protocols to ensure swift intervention when needed. We have also made infrastructural enhancements, such as by installing duress alarms. This partnership is key to ensuring safety and security in the Home. "
timeline for resolving noise disturbance problem caused by birds in potong pasir,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for National Development whether AVA can provide a timeline for resolving the noise disturbance problem caused by birds in Potong Pasir since the matter was raised two years ago.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: A sustainable myna management strategy requires a holistic suite of measures, such as the removal of food sources made available by humans, habitat modification, and population control strategies. To this end, AVA and NParks have been working with the Jalan Besar Town Council to address the noise disturbance issue at Potong Pasir caused by Javan Mynas. NParks has regularly pruned trees in Potong Pasir to discourage the mynas from roosting in the affected areas. AVA has also worked with the Town Council to ensure proper food waste management, as the presence of improperly disposed food waste exacerbates the situation. AVA has also tried to move the birds away from trees near residential areas. For instance, in September 2017, AVA trialled the use of lasers to disperse the birds at Potong Pasir, but assessed that this is not a sustainable solution as the birds returned once the lasers were switched off. AVA has also conducted trials in other parts of Singapore, such as using natural bird repellent and passing low electrical currents through roost trees. However, these trials had limited long-term effects. AVA will continue to refine and assess other possible methods.The Javan Myna is not native to Singapore. It is an invasive bird species. If the mynas continue to roost in large numbers, they will pose a threat to native bird species as they compete for nesting and food resources, as well as cause hygiene and noise issues. Thus, there is a need to remove some birds in order for longer-term management measures to be effective. In this regard, AVA conducted a trial in Potong Pasir in December 2018 using roost nets to trap the mynas. This was adapted from a system developed by the Australian National University, where the roosting mynas are trapped while in the trees, and then euthanised in a controlled and humane manner. AVA is fine-tuning the method before considering wider deployment. In tandem, NParks is working with the Jalan Besar Town Council to undertake habitat modification measures to reduce the number of mynas roosting in the estate. First, trees in the estate will be pruned to make them less attractive as roost sites. This will be completed in January 2019. We expect the mynas to disperse to non-residential areas once the tree crowns are pruned. Second, to sustain this effect over the long-term, the current roost trees will be replaced with tree types that are less preferred by the mynas. These are trees with crowns that are less dense, but will still provide greenery and shade. Agencies will continue to work closely with the Jalan Besar Town Council to manage the myna situation at Potong Pasir. The public must also play its part by maintaining the overall cleanliness of the environment and not feeding wild birds.  "
blood donation rates compared to other countries and contingency measures for blood shortages,"Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked the Minister for Health (a) how does our resident population blood donor rate compare with other developed countries, such as South Korea, Germany and the US; (b) what contingency measures are in place for blood shortages; and (c) how will the Ministry ensure that blood donations keep up with increasing blood usage due to our ageing population.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Health Sciences Authority, or HSA, is responsible for providing a safe and adequate blood supply for our patients. It works closely with the Singapore Red Cross, or SRC, to recruit voluntary blood donors under the National Blood Programme. The SRC leverages its networks with companies, communities, hospitals, religious groups, schools and the uniformed groups to recruit blood donors.About 73,000 blood donors contributed to the blood programme in 2017, giving a donor participation rate of 1.8%. This is comparable to countries and cities in the Asia-Pacific region such as Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong, where donor participation rates range between 1.9% and 2.2%. Overall, our donor pool has been adequate to meet blood demand. Nevertheless, occasional blood shortages may arise especially during festive seasons or school holidays, when many blood donors travel overseas. In such a situation, the SRC will ramp up recall efforts through social media, text messages and direct donor calls. More mobile blood drives may also be set up across the island. During rare instances when blood stocks fall below a critical level, HSA may work with hospitals to postpone some non-urgent surgeries until the blood stocks improve. HSA and SRC may also launch an appeal for blood donations through the mass media. We have embarked on efforts to improve our outreach. For example, HSA has built satellite blood banks closer to where donors live, work or study. HSA and SRC have also focused on getting more young people to become regular blood donors. Frequent mobile drives are also set up at schools, polytechnics and universities. We encourage the community to volunteer to become regular blood donors, particularly as demand will increase over time."
higher workplace fatalities in construction industry in 2018,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what are the reasons of higher workplace fatalities in the construction industry in 2018 as compared to 2017; (b) what is the profile of the fatalities; and (c) what more can be done to reduce workplace fatalities in the construction industry.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: Construction workplace fatalities have been on the decline, from an average of 29 between 2009 and 2013 to an average of 21 between 2014 and 2018. It increased marginally from 12 in 2017 to 14 in 2018, reflecting the challenge of sustaining the improvements over the last decade.Falls from height remain the main contributor in recent years. The accidents were caused by either the lack of barricades over open sides, or by not using properly attached safety lines. There was a higher proportion of foreign workers with less than two years' experience in Singapore among the fatalities.Our existing approach to raise awareness on safety lapses while carrying out targeted enforcement has helped to reduce construction fatalities. We will continue to work with the WSH Council to raise safety and health awareness through campaigns, roadshows and events at dormitories. In 2018, we have reached out to around 50,000 construction workers to educate them on safety risks, especially from falls. We also share the learning points from recent accidents with the construction industry, including partners like the Singapore Contractors Association Limited. Safety training especially for less experienced foreign workers is crucial. This is why we have mandatory safety orientation training for new workers, conducted in eight languages. Refresher courses are also required every two years, with frequency reduced after six years of experience.In addition, MOM will sustain regular inspections. We conducted about 3,000 construction inspections last year, covering close to 70% of active construction sites. They resulted in 55 Stop-Work-Orders and 1,100 composition fines. Formed in Feb 2018, the WSH2028 Tripartite Strategies Committee has been discussing how we can improve our WSH outcomes. It is expected to release its recommendations in February 2019."
"initiatives with companies such as facebook for ""suicide watch"" intervention programmes","Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) how can the Ministry work with social media companies to help residents who are in distress or have suicidal tendencies; and (b) whether there are plans to develop initiatives with companies such as Facebook on ""suicide watch"" type of intervention programmes.","Mr Desmond Lee: Singapore adopts a whole-of-society, multi-pronged approach to address the complex nature of suicide. The Government and community partners work together to promote upstream prevention, encourage individuals to seek help, provide support to at-risk groups, and offer crisis support. Many of these efforts need to take place in person to be effective, while some are complemented by online efforts. For example, the Institute of Mental Health (IMH)'s Community Health Assessment Team (CHAT) has a drop-in centre at *SCAPE Youth Park and an online WebCHAT service for young persons in need of mental health support. The National Council of Social Service (NCSS) is running a multi-year public education campaign on mental health issues, called 'Beyond the Label'. Apart from making available information on where to seek help, a Facebook community page has also been set up as a safe space for the online community to share experiences and provide support to those in recovery. A key community partner is the Samaritans of Singapore or SOS, which provides programmes to train professionals and the public on how to identify suicide warning signs, which may be observed on social media, and on how to support the individual. The evidence for ""suicide watch"" interventions, which depend on the robustness of the computer algorithms, is currently unclear. There may also be concerns about data privacy and civil liberties, as automated actions may kick in once warning signs are picked up, regardless of whether the distress is real or inaccurately diagnosed. We will continue to review how we enhance our suicide prevention efforts in both physical and online spaces. "
calculation of cpf ordinary account (oa) interest rate,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether computation of the CPF Ordinary Account (OA) interest rate, based on indicative Singapore bank fixed deposit and savings rates, reflects the actual market interest rate for deposit accounts, given banks' widespread use of bonus interest rates linked to salary credits, etc; and (b) whether the Ministry will study alternative methods of CPF OA interest rate computation to reflect the actual average weighted interest rates earned on deposit accounts with Singapore banks and the implications thereof for retirement adequacy.","Mrs Josephine Teo: CPF interest rates are pegged to returns on investments of comparable risk and duration in the market. The Ordinary Account (OA) is a liquid account as the savings can be withdrawn at any time for home purchases. This is why the OA interest rate is pegged to the higher of (i) the three-month average of major local banks' interest rates or (ii) the legislated minimum interest of 2.5% per annum. As the computed rate based on the three-month average of major local banks' interest rates is 0.4% per annum, the current OA interest rate is 2.5% per annum for Q1 2019.Bonus rates given by banks are not comparable with CPF interest rates. The bonus rates are typically contingent on customers fulfilling other criteria such as minimum spending on credit cards, crediting of salary, or making bill payments through an account. The effective interest rate may be much lower because the bonus rates are usually capped to a certain amount. In other words, they are not uniformly applicable to all balances of all depositors.  Members may consider transferring their OA savings to the Special Account (SA) to earn a higher interest rate. Balances in the SA currently earn 4 – 6% per annum. In 2017, over 20,000 members transferred nearly $470 million into their SA."
impact of smoking ban in orchard road on shopping experience there,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources since the implementation of the smoking ban in the Orchard Road area (a) how many smokers have been warned; (b) what has been the response of foreign visitors; and (c) what has been the impact on shopping experience in the Orchard Road area.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The Orchard Road No-Smoking Zone (NSZ) came into force on 1 January 2019, as part of the Government’s long term goal of achieving a smoke-free Singapore.  To date, about 2,200 verbal advisories have been issued daily by the National Environment Agency (NEA) to smokers for lighting up in the newly-prohibited areas. Smokers – including foreign visitors – have been generally receptive when advised by NEA officers about the new law. Most comply by smoking at one of the more than 40 Designated Smoking Areas located within the NSZ. NEA will maintain this advisory approach during the first three months of the prohibition, and will closely monitor the situation on the ground to ensure the NSZ is implemented smoothly. With the shopping belt and its main thoroughfare now smoke-free, we expect the overall shopping experience in Orchard Road to improve, as pedestrians can enjoy cleaner air and a healthier environment there."
gardasil vaccine not replaced with gardasil-9 vaccine in medisave claimable list,Ms Irene Quay Siew Ching asked the Minister for Health why the Gardasil vaccine is not replaced with the Gardasil-9 vaccine under the MediSave claimable list as the latter drug (launched since 2017) covers more strains of the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and increases overall cervical cancer prevention from 70% to up to 90%.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: There are currently three human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines available in Singapore – Cervarix, Gardasil, and Gardasil 9. In Singapore, HPV vaccination is recommended for females age nine to 26 years and MediSave use is extended for vaccinations using Cervarix or Gardasil. These two vaccines protect against HPV infection from two of the most common types (16 and 18), which account for 70% of cervical cancer cases, and have been shown to be both clinically- and cost-effective in the local setting.Gardasil 9 is a relatively new vaccine which potentially extends protection against additional cancer-causing HPV types. MOH is currently in the process of evaluating its cost-effectiveness, compared to the other HPV vaccines."
lessons for singapore from october 2018 hong kong mtr breakdown,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked ask the Minister for Transport (a) what are the lessons that can be learnt from the Hong Kong MTR breakdown in October 2018 as a result of a system glitch; and (b) what measures have been put in place to prevent such incidents from occurring in our MRT system.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: In the morning of 16 October 2018, train services on four major Hong Kong MTR lines were affected for up to six hours. Train services remained open but had to operate at reduced speeds and lower frequency, resulting in longer travelling times for commuters. Investigations by Hong Kong authorities are still on-going. Initial findings released by the Legislative Council Panel on Transport indicate that the incident was caused by a signalling system failure. There was a loss of synchronisation between the signalling systems used by the four rail lines. The signalling systems of the four lines are inter-connected by design, and are provided by two different suppliers, Alstom and Siemens. The suppliers use different system settings. For normal functioning, the data transmission from these different signalling systems must be seamlessly synchronised at all times to ensure that the two systems communicate with each other for delivering train control commands. Inter-connection of the two systems is achieved through the computers which connect the systems. Unfortunately, the synchronisation failed on 16 October. It was rectified only after the operator isolated the connections between the lines and re-booted all computers. These are preliminary findings and are subject to further investigation which is on-going. The likelihood of a similar loss of synchronisation between the signalling systems of our different MRT lines is low. First, the signalling systems for the Circle Line, Downtown Line and North East Line operate as separate systems. They do not require any synchronisation. Second, although the North-South and East-West Lines share the same signalling system, it is provided by the same supplier, Thales, and have the exact same settings. Hence, there is no need to synchronise across different systems from different suppliers.However, the Hong Kong incident is a timely reminder that MRT lines are highly complex engineering systems. We must never let our guard down. Our train operators must develop deep engineering expertise in the systems we procure. They must devote sufficient resources to engineering and give top management attention to operation and maintenance. As the MRT network upgrades and expands, different generations of technology are acquired and have to work seamlessly together. The re-signalling of the North-South and East-West Lines is an example of how complicated the project is. The re-signalling of the North-South Line was eventful precisely because of such complications. The lack of engineering hours to carry out essential testing added to the already challenging task. After the train collision incident in November 2017, the public supported more engineering hours through ECLO – Early Closure and Late Opening. That has made a significant difference to the re-signalling project for the East-West Line, which has been carried out more smoothly as compared to the re-signalling project for the North-South Line. Another lesson from the Hong Kong incident is the importance of standardisation, I made this point in a recent speech to our engineers. As our rail network becomes more extensive, we need to think about how we can better standardize systems across the rail network. By 2030, we will have eight MRT lines. Is it wise to end up with eight different systems, whether it is for signalling, or trains, or power? If we do, our engineers will have to learn eight different systems, multiplied by as many different assets. This will not be a good use of limited engineering talent, not to mention the higher holding cost of spare parts, loss of economies of scale and greater complication in operations.  The Hong Kong incident is unfortunate. Each incident is a reminder that unplanned incidents can happen to the most competent operator. We will continue to monitor the outcome of the investigations of the 16 October incident in Hong Kong, and put in the necessary measures to mitigate any similar vulnerabilities in our own rail network."
lowering cpf payout age,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether the Ministry will consider lowering the CPF payout age to the retirement age; and (b) whether exceptions can be made to grant a CPF member an early withdrawal or payout of his CPF funds where the member has no choice but to retire early.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: The CPF Payout Eligibility Age is currently at 65. This was raised gradually from age 62 in 2007 to ensure that Singaporeans, who are living longer, are able to set aside enough CPF savings to meet their retirement needs. There are no plans to lower the CPF Payout Eligibility Age.With our re-employment laws, more than 98% of private-sector local workers reaching age 62 who wish to continue working are offered re-employment. A similarly high proportion (97.5%) among those reaching the age of 65 were offered re-employment.  Members who have stopped working because they are terminally ill or permanently incapacitated can approach CPF Board for early withdrawals of their CPF monies. The CPF Board will carefully consider their appeals and approve those with valid medical grounds. In other cases where the member has stopped working, the reasons would vary widely and appeals for early CPF withdrawals are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. A key consideration is the member’s retirement adequacy. From the age of 55, members can withdraw their CPF savings above the Basic Retirement Sum if they have made a sufficient property pledge. It would not be in the member’s interest to further deplete his retirement savings through additional early withdrawals.Instead, we work closely with tripartite partners to help the member get back to work, through heavily-subsidised job assistance programmes, such as Career Trial and Professional Conversion Programmes. If the member is among the small minority that was not offered re-employment due to lack of suitable vacancies, he would have been given an Employment Assistance Payment (EAP) by his employers to tide him over a period of time while he looks for another job. A member who has exhausted his EAP or face financial difficulties in the interim may also access a range of social support, including ComCare Short-to-Medium Term Assistance, which provides a combination of employment assistance, cash allowance, rental, utilities, as well as referrals to other agencies for further assistance, depending on the member’s needs. "
limiting number of massage establishment licences within defined locality,"Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what has been the highest number of massage establishment licences issued to outlets within the same building and within the same neighbourhood precinct; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider a cap on such licences issued within a defined locality, especially where such congregation of massage establishments are in close proximity of residential housing.","Mr K Shanmugam: The Member asked about the highest number of massage establishment (ME) licences issued within a building and a neighborhood precinct. On the former, People’s Park Complex has 12 licensed MEs. The Police do not track such data on a precinct level.  It would not be meaningful to look at such figures on their own, or for that matter, impose caps on the number of MEs allowed per locality. The Police assess applications to operate MEs on a case-by-case basis. They consider factors such as the suitability of the location, whether the proposed ME will cause dis-amenities to the surrounding areas, as well as the characteristics of the businesses there. The Police also take into account feedback from the residents and the Advisers.The Massage Establishments Act that came into force earlier this year was introduced to reduce the disamenities from MEs. Operating hours for all MEs, other than those in designated areas such as Orchard Road or Marina Bay, will be restricted, and in particular they must close by 10.30pm daily. The conditions for MEs in HDB estates are even stricter. They must obtain a Category One licence under the Police licensing framework, obtain CaseTrust accreditation, put in a minimum capital investment of $50,000, and have a minimum floor area of 100 square metres.The Police will continue to take strict enforcement action against errant MEs. Unlicensed ME operators face a fine of up to $20,000, or five years’ imprisonment, or both. Licensed ME operators who commit regulatory breaches face a fine of up to $10,000, or two years’ imprisonment years, or both. "
impact of overseas developments on singapore’s waste recycling efforts,"Mr Ong Teng Koon asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether China's implementation of the ""National Sword"" policy which aims to ban the import of contaminated recyclables, has impacted Singapore's ability to recycle paper, plastic and electronic waste.","11 Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether there are plans to build a complete plastic recycling infrastructure in Singapore to cope with all our recyclable plastic waste instead of having to export it overseas. Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M:  NEA is in close contact with the waste and recycling companies in Singapore, and understands that our recycling industry is able to sell their plastics and paper to overseas markets. Some of the recyclables collected in Singapore are processed locally by recyclers, such as TES and Cimelia which treat e-waste. Some local companies are also processing our plastic waste, for example A~Star Plastics and Plaspulp Union Company. We will continue to monitor the developments relating to China’s ban on imports of certain unprocessed waste.Meanwhile, we are building up the local recycling industry. Where possible, we want to better extract resources from waste and close the waste loop domestically. NEA is currently studying e-waste and plastics recycling solutions and technologies available in the market, and assessing their suitability for adoption in Singapore. The findings will help us further develop Singapore’s recycling capability as part of our Environmental Services industry transformation efforts. "
mandating home protection scheme for those who service loans for hdb flats with cash or cpf funds,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether HDB will reconsider to make it compulsory for HDB owners who either use cash or CPF to service their housing loan to sign up for the Home Protection Scheme (HPS); and (b) in the past three years, how many HDB owners did not use CPF to service their housing loan instalment and did not purchase HPS as well.","Mr Lawrence Wong: About 20% of HDB flat buyers in 2017 who took a mortgage loan used cash to service their loans. Among them, 4 in 10 did not voluntarily take up the Home Protection Scheme (HPS). Effectively this means that around 92% of recent HDB flat buyers with outstanding loans are covered under the HPS policy, or have voluntarily taken up HPS. Besides HPS, some home buyers may have purchased mortgage-reducing products from the private sector.  We do not have detailed records of such purchases, but many commercial banks offer such mortgage-reducing insurance (MRI) products as part of their loan financing package to home buyers. So the overall insurance coverage may well be higher.   HDB will continue to work with CPF Board to further encourage take-up of HPS.  We will continue to monitor the situation and assess whether to implement further measures if the need arises. "
circular economy framework for waste-producing sectors,"Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what is the circular economy framework in place for various waste-producing sectors in Singapore including those for packaging and electronic products; (b) whether the current legislation is sufficient to sustain a circular economy in the waste sector; and (c) if not, whether there are plans to introduce further legislation.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The circular economy framework is aimed at closing resource loops and creating economic opportunities by maximising resource use and minimising waste. Key elements include sustainable production and consumption, as well as managing waste as a resource, such as by promoting the 3Rs – reduce, reuse and recycle. These elements are already embedded in our existing policies and form the basis of our strategy towards becoming a Zero Waste Nation. We will introduce new legislation to implement Extended Producer Responsibility, or EPR, for e-waste by 2021. EPR adopts circular economy principles by incentivising better design of electrical and electronic products to make them last longer and easier to recycle, while ensuring that these products are properly collected and recycled at their end-of-life. Another example of the circular economy is the industry-led Singapore Packaging Agreement, where companies commit to reduce packaging waste through changes in packaging processes, designs or usage practices, or recycling of packaging waste. We will build on this to introduce mandatory reporting of packaging data and packaging waste reductions plans in 2020. We are also studying the feasibility of extending EPR to manage packaging waste. Our industries have also adopted circular economy principles in their business models. For example, many construction companies recycle demolished concrete into aggregates which can be used to construct roads or manufacture concrete. In 2017, the recycling rate of construction and demolition waste was 99%. My Ministry is working on a Zero Waste Masterplan. We will consult our stakeholders, including households, businesses and non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and invite feedback and ideas. At the same time, we can all play a part in the circular economy. Consumers can repair damaged furniture, appliances and clothes and prolong their use, or share less commonly used household items with neighbours. The industry should design products to last longer or to make recycling easier. Our NGOs can help rally the ground in this effort. With our combined efforts, we can move closer towards becoming a Zero Waste Nation.  "
"impact of proposed acquisition by foreign company of hyflux shareholding on singapore’s ""national taps"" water strategy",Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether the proposed acquisition of a substantial shareholding of Hyflux Ltd by a foreign company will have any material impact on two of our national taps (NEWater and desalination); (b) whether steps are taken to mitigate any potential impact on end-consumers and businesses in terms of water supply and pricing; and (c) whether there will be any adverse risk to our water security.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: PUB's key interest is to safeguard Singapore’s water security and confidence in our water supply. Hyflux is currently involved in two desalination plants under Design, Build, Own and Operate arrangements, or DBOO for short. Hyflux owns Tuaspring Desalination Plant wholly via its subsidiary, and has a 30% minority stake in SingSpring Desalination Plant. Hyflux does not own or run any NEWater plants in Singapore.PUB has been closely monitoring developments relating to Hyflux's debt situation and its business reorganisation. As reported in the media, Hyflux has entered into a restructuring agreement with an Indonesian consortium, SM Investments Private Limited. This is a commercial matter and restructuring discussions are ongoing. It will therefore not be appropriate for my Ministry to comment on the details. Nonetheless, Members can be assured that we will not allow our water security to be affected. The DBOO model allows us to tap on private sector expertise to deliver cost effective solutions for NEWater and desalination. We have welcomed participation from both local and foreign companies. At the same time, water security is critical to Singapore's survival. Where we have allowed private sector participation via the DBOO model, safeguards are in place. PUB has adequate measures to ensure DBOO plants remain in operation and supply is not disrupted. It is a top strategic priority of the Government to keep our taps flowing.  "
"assessed threats of rising sea levels to reservoirs, coastal areas and reclaimed land in singapore","Mr Chong Kee Hiong asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources what are the assessed threats of rising sea levels to our reservoirs and coastal areas, particularly reclaimed land, and what are the measures to boost the protection for these areas.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Climate change is real and we are already seeing some effects in terms of changes in our weather. Another effect is potential rise in sea levels. This is a complex issue with far-reaching implications, especially for an island city-state such as Singapore. To understand the assessed risks and impacts of long-term sea level rise on our coastal areas, multiple agencies are working together to study this issue carefully. We have taken early steps to protect our coastal areas. Currently, over 70% of our coastline is protected from coastal erosion through hard structures or stone embankments. Since 2011, PUB has revised the Code of Practice on Surface Water Drainage to raise minimum reclamation levels for newly reclaimed lands and minimum platform levels for coastal developments by one metre, to at least four metres above the mean sea level. LTA has also raised some roads near coastal areas, including a stretch of Changi Coast Road and Nicoll Drive. We are building future developments at higher platform levels as a safeguard against rising sea levels. For example, Changi Airport Terminal 5 will be built at 5.5 metres above the mean sea level. More will be done. In 2015, the Centre for Climate Research Singapore – a department under the National Environment Agency – projected that Singapore could experience sea level rise of up to one metre by 2100. Building on these findings, work is currently ongoing to assess the risks and impacts of such long-term sea level rise on Singapore’s coastal areas. Government agencies are developing a national framework for coastal protection, which includes developing long-term plans to protect vulnerable areas from sea-level rise. These plans and framework will help us to take timely and concrete steps to guard against sea level rise in the long term."
key performance indicators for scheme to help hospitals scale up adoption of smart technologies,Ms Irene Quay Siew Ching asked the Minister for Health what are the key performance indicators and the percentage of these indicators that have been met under the $62.5 million pilot to scale up hospitals' adoption of smart technologies as part of the Smart Nursing Ward initiative under the Healthcare Industry Transformation Map.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Nurses make up the largest proportion of our healthcare workforce, constituting more than 40% of the workforce in public hospitals today.In March 2018, MOH launched the Healthcare Productivity Fund – Smart Nursing Ward Programme, a key initiative under the Healthcare Industry Transformation Map. This programme supports hospitals in improving nursing processes and adopting smart solutions so as to reduce our nurses' administrative load and enable them to focus more attention on direct patient care.Some of the areas being looked into include inventory management, materials delivery, patient monitoring and patient transport. Some technology solutions being explored include Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. For example, AMRs were earlier piloted in some of our public hospitals to transport items such as consumables and medication. One deployment saved as many as six Full Time Equivalents (FTEs). Under the Smart Nursing Ward programme, we are exploring to expand the use of these AMRs, by deploying them to deliver medical instruments. This aims to save time for nurses from walking back and forth between sterilisation facilities and Operating Theatres, enabling them to focus on direct care.As part of the programme's eligibility criteria, proposed projects are required to strive for at least 10% nursing time-savings. As the programme was only launched in March 2018, many of the projects have just been initiated or are being explored. It is thus premature to assess the progress."
retailers' concerns over existing pmd stocks that do not meet new fire safety requirement,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Transport with regard to the fire safety criterion for PMDs (a) how does the Government plan to address the concerns of retailers who are holding stocks of devices that do not meet the requirements but are unable to sell them due to declining sales; (b) whether interim assistance can be provided for retailers to ensure that some of their devices meet the UL2272 Safety Standard; and (c) whether the authorities will allow alternative safety standards beyond UL2272.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Since 2016, there have been more than 80 fire incidents involving motorised personal mobility devices (PMDs), posing danger to the users, their immediate families and their neighbours. LTA made known its intention to study and apply product safety requirements on PMDs in November 2017. After studying the available international standards, LTA announced in September 2018 that the UL2272 standard will be applied to the sale of motorised PMDs in Singapore from July 2019, and to the use of motorised PMDs on public paths in Singapore from January 2021. To mitigate the impact on PMD retailers, LTA has provided retailers with a transition period of nine months to switch their inventories to comply with the regulations. Retailers can also choose to re-export devices that do not comply with the standard. To support the retailers during this transition period, LTA has been engaging retailers to address their queries and to provide more information on the testing and certification process for UL2272. LTA is also working closely with accredited certification bodies to make testing and certification more easily accessible to the retailers. LTA is also open to considering other safety standards which are found adequate for reducing fire risks for motorised PMDs and are suitable for our local context. "
waiving requirement for consent from ex-spouse for listing of children as occupiers in hdb flats for selected conditions,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry will consider waiving the requirement for ex-spousal consent on who can list the children as occupiers in a HDB flat application if the ex-spouse has already purchased a private property or a HDB flat following the divorce.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Parents with shared care and control have equal right to list their children in their flat application. Hence, the requirement for one parent to obtain agreement from the other is in place because we respect the right of each parent to purchase a HDB flat with their children.  While we encourage parents to resolve matters in the best interest of their children, we understand the concern that reaching mutual agreement might be difficult in some divorces. In such situations, HDB adopts a needs-based approach and exercises flexibility on a case by case basis. In particular, if the ex-spouse has purchased another property, we will indeed take that into consideration in our assessment of the case.  "
reasons for rise in child abuse cases,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Social and Family Development with regard to the rise in child abuse cases within the family (a) what is the nature of the abuse; (b) what is the profile of the perpetrators; and (c) what are some of the main reasons behind these abuse cases.,"Mr Desmond Lee: In 2017, MSF's Child Protective Service (CPS) investigated 894 cases of child abuse. This is an increase from the 873 cases investigated in 2016, and 551 cases in 2015. The nature of the cases includes physical abuse, sexual abuse and neglect. In most of these cases, the perpetrator is a family member. The reasons for child abuse are often complex and complicated. For example, caregivers of abused children may themselves be in difficult circumstances and under stress. The problems caregivers face can often have direct impact on children. Many child abuse cases investigated by CPS involve families with multiple stressors, such as financial problems and unemployment. We have also encountered caregivers who themselves had prior history of abuse or neglect as a child, are battling drug addictions or mental health issues, or had trouble with the law. "
traffic signal countdown timers at traffic junctions,"Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Transport whether LTA will consider installing traffic signal countdown timers at traffic junctions, given that many countries have implemented the timer with a view to improving road safety.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: In 2003, LTA conducted a traffic signal countdown timer trial at the junction of North Bridge Road and Rochor Road over a period of six months. The trial showed that countdown timers did not improve road safety. Some motorists accelerated to beat the red light, increasing the likelihood of rear-end collisions at traffic junctions. Over the years, we have continued to monitor the experience in other countries that have conducted similar trials. Overseas jurisdictions that have installed traffic signal countdown timers also did not observe any significant improvement to road safety. Hence, LTA has no plans to install traffic signal countdown timers at traffic junctions."
air filters effective in filtering out harmful effects of second-hand smoke,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry is aware of any air filters available in the market which have been proven to effectively filter out the harmful effects of second-hand smoke in private homes.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: We are unaware of any air filtration technology which would be effective at filtering out the harmful effects of cigarette smoke.The toxic constituents of cigarette smoke are both particulate and gaseous in nature. Residential air cleaning technology is unable to adequately remove all of the gaseous components, such as formaldehyde, benzene and carbon monoxide."
effectiveness of efforts to attract and retain singaporean medical students who had studied abroad to work in singapore,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Health with regard to the increasing number of foreign doctors in public hospitals and polyclinics (a) whether there is success in efforts to attract Singaporean medical students studying abroad to return to work in Singapore; (b) whether there is success in retaining those who returned to Singapore beyond the three to four years which they are required to serve in a public hospital; and (c) what further measures is the Government considering to reverse the shortage of Singaporean medical staff.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: To meet our medical manpower needs, MOH has steadily ramped up intakes of our medical schools by 40%, from 354 in 2012 to 500 in 2018. Our medical schools will remain our primary source of new doctors. An average of about 200 overseas-trained local doctors returned each year in the last three years, more than double of that in 2010. As our local pipeline has grown significantly over the years, we expect our need to recruit overseas-trained doctors to moderate and stabilise in the coming years. Of those who returned and registered with Singapore Medical Council between 2010 and 2012, more than 9 in 10 continued to practice in Singapore even after five years and about 4 in 5 stayed in the public sector for five years or more.Our public healthcare institutions will continue to provide a conducive work environment for all healthcare staff by improving work processes for doctors and adopting technology to streamline workload. We are also providing more training and development opportunities for career progression. Our healthcare staff, including doctors, also have a wide range of opportunities to work in different institutions and settings within the healthcare sector.Beside doctors, we are also stepping up recruitment and retention efforts for other healthcare professionals like nurses. Over the years, we have increased salaries and broadened opportunities for nurses, including providing greater autonomy in their roles, and increasing opportunities and funding support for training. The intakes of our local nursing courses have also increased significantly from around 1,500 in 2012 to more than 2,100 in 2018.MOH will continue to review our manpower strategies based on projected future healthcare needs, taking into consideration the changing healthcare context, and ensure we have adequate manpower supplies."
impact of foreign student holiday work passes on jobs and internship opportunities for singaporean graduates and undergraduates,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Manpower in the past three years (a) how many foreign students have been issued work passes under the Work Holiday Programme; (b) which types of industries and jobs do they usually work in; and (c) how has this impacted on jobs and internship opportunities for Singaporean graduates and undergraduates.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: The Work Holiday Programme (WHP) allows eligible students and young graduates of universities in nine countries or regions to work and holiday in Singapore for up to 6 months. The WHP is subject to a quota of 2,000 applicants at any one time, which is shared amongst the nine countries or regions that are part of the WHP (Australia, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand, Switzerland, United Kingdom and United States).In the past three years (2015-2017), on average, 2,800 applicants have been issued a Work Holiday Pass each year. This Pass grants them the right to stay in Singapore for up to six months, and gives them an option to work without applying for an additional work pass. The Ministry of Manpower does not collect information on the jobs and industries that the WHP holders work in. Some may not work at all.The WHP has not affected jobs and internship opportunities for Singaporean graduates and undergraduates. Based on the Graduate Employment Survey conducted by the Institutes of Higher Learning, in each of the last three years, about 9 in 10 economically active graduates from the Autonomous Universities (AUs) and Polytechnics were employed within six months of graduation. This is about the same level as before the WHP was introduced.The internship participation rates for Polytechnics have also remained stable for the past three years and the rates for the AUs have been increasing gradually. Today, approximately 98% of Polytechnic students and 70% of AU students would have done at least one internship by the time they graduate. Our Polytechnics and AUs also provide overseas exposure opportunities for our students, and completed over 1,600 overseas internship placements in Academic Year 2016/2017.  "
actions to mitigate rain splashing into common corridors for hdb flats that have gone through home improvement programme,"Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Minister for National Development with regard to HDB flats in Boon Lay constituency which are more than 30 years of age and have completed the Home Improvement Programme (HIP), what more can the Ministry do to mitigate rain splashing into the common corridors, lift landings, corridors and front doors and windows of these flats.","Mr Lawrence Wong: The lift lobbies and common corridors at HDB projects are designed to be naturally lit and ventilated. This open concept design is eco-friendly and lowers maintenance costs.During a heavy downpour, especially during monsoon season, some rainwater splashing along the more open areas like lift lobbies and common corridors is inevitable. For weather protection, common corridors are therefore provided with an extended overhang, that is, a canopy. While this is generally adequate to minimise rainwater splashing during normal rainy days, it may not be able to fully prevent the corridor from getting wet during heavy downpours accompanied by strong winds.  When HDB receives feedback from residents, it will assess the extent of the rainwater splashing. If the splashing is severe and likely to damage the main entrance door of the unit, HDB will provide a rain screen, subject to SCDF's fire safety requirements to ensure that there is adequate open space and cross ventilation at the common corridor to facilitate the quick dispersal of smoke during emergencies such as fire outbreak. The provision of rain screen is a cost effective solution, and residents can submit their feedback to HDB whenever they identify the issue, regardless of whether their units have undergone HIP. Members who have feedback on issues related to specific blocks can approach HDB so that we can look into the details."
cases of windows of hdb flats being dislodged,"Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for National Development (a) in the last three years, what is the number of reported cases of the windows of HDB flat being dislodged and falling to the ground; (b) what is the average age of such HDB flats; and (c) whether HDB can include window replacement in the Home Improvement Programme as many home owners may not be able to afford the replacement cost.","Mr Lawrence Wong: In the last three years, there were 117 incidents of fallen windows, affecting about 0.01% of HDB residential units. The average age of HDB flats involved in such incidents is about 33 years.Windows come in many sizes and designs, and would have to be custom-made to suit the preferences of residents. Flat owners also have the responsibility to ensure that the windows in their flat are well maintained so that they do not fall off and endanger the public. They are therefore in a better position to decide when and how to replace their windows. There are also existing programmes in the Community Development Councils for residents who need financial assistance with small scale home renovation and maintenance works."
proposal to review retirement age for police officers,"Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether there are any plans to review the retirement age of 55 years, including that for senior police officers, given that the nature of policing has changed to require even more experience and knowledge.","Mr K Shanmugam: MHA had extended the retirement age for Home Affairs Uniformed Service (HUS) officers just five years ago, when it was raised from 50 to 55 years. We will continue to periodically review it, as the general retirement age increases, and Singaporeans live longer and healthier lives.   When HUS officers reach the age of 55, some of them may be offered extension of service.   As for those for whom we do not have posts to re-employ, MHA is investing significant effort and has put in place structures to systematically help them find new employment. We outlined these measures in a reply to a Parliamentary Question in February this year.  "
structural gaps in existing support programmes for low-income and vulnerable families,"Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) whether there are structural gaps in the existing support structures for low-income and vulnerable families in Singapore and, if so, what are these gaps; and (b) what are the specific opportunities for the community to assist and augment the existing support structures to close these gaps.","Mr Desmond Lee: The Government is committed to build a fair, inclusive, and caring society, where all Singaporeans have opportunities to do well and progress. In the past decade, outcomes for the low-income and vulnerable families have improved in various aspects such as education, employment, income, housing, and healthcare. Nonetheless, our system is not perfect and the Government will continue to work with the community, to find ways to do better. First, as the economy matures, we recognise that one's family resources or disadvantages may be passed on and amplified in the next generation, which will affect social mobility. Hence, the Government will continue to invest even earlier in our children's educational journey, especially for those from disadvantaged families through initiatives such as the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA)'s KidSTART pilot. ECDA will continue to increase the number of accessible, affordable, and quality preschool places, and partner the community to reach out to children from low-income families who are not attending preschool, to better understand their reasons for non-participation and facilitate enrolment. The community plays an important role to complement the Government's efforts. For example, to support low-income families where parents are working at night, community initiatives such as CareNights@Morning Star by Temasek Foundation Cares provide free night care for their children. Second, with a volatile global environment and the emergence of new technologies, the sense of economic insecurity among Singaporeans may increase. The Workfare Income Supplement Scheme helps lower-wage workers raise their incomes and encourages them to stay employed by providing CPF top-ups and cash supplements. The Adapt and Grow initiative helps unemployed and at-risk workers to take up new jobs as quickly as possible. SkillsFuture provides Singaporeans with training opportunities for lifelong learning and reskilling, so as to equip them with industry-relevant skills and broaden the opportunities that they can access throughout life. The Government will also continue to support the training and up-skilling of lower-wage workers through Workfare Training Support, to achieve sustainable productivity and wage growth.  Third, low-income and vulnerable families often have complex needs and require coordinated help from multiple agencies. MSF will work with other government and community agencies to enhance our social service delivery and strengthen our social service network of support. For example, we are progressively equipping frontline officers with knowledge of different help schemes and services, so that they can help families access schemes and services to meet their needs holistically. We are also sharing information and assessments across agencies to reduce the need for households in need to submit multiple applications. We will also facilitate the appointment of a lead agency to coordinate support for complex cases, to ensure that agencies' interventions work in tandem with one another, to help families towards longer-term stability. To strengthen support for vulnerable families living in rental housing, MSF and the Ministry of National Development will bring together community partners, to provide more targeted support to rental families, and work with them on a joint plan of action. We will set up white spaces at or near rental clusters, where volunteers, civic organisations, and corporates can establish and run customised services and programmes. To enable and support community efforts, MSF and the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth have been gathering community partners through SG Cares Community Network sessions, to facilitate cross-agency conversations and collaborations among community partners so that they can better support areas of need in the respective towns. With a common picture of the community's needs and assets, community partners can pool their resources more effectively to co-create customised local programmes and services. The Ministry of Health will also step up support for low-income and vulnerable seniors through Community Networks for Seniors, bringing together Government agencies, community partners, and volunteers to promote active ageing and provide health and social care services. Supporting our low-income and vulnerable families requires a whole-of-society approach. We invite everyone from all sectors to join us in this collective effort.  "
companies that have tapped on lean enterprise development scheme,"Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the number of companies that have tapped on the Lean Enterprise Development Scheme (LEDS) since it started; (b) how do these companies perform in terms of achieving the outcomes of becoming more manpower lean, having a stronger Singaporean core and a better quality workforce; (c) how are the outcomes measured and monitored to determine the success of the scheme; and (d) which industry or sector has been most impacted by LEDS.","Mrs Josephine Teo: The Lean Enterprise Development (LED) Scheme, started in October 2015, is an umbrella scheme for enterprises to access Government support for productivity improvement or manpower-lean initiatives, through grants offered by Workforce Singapore (WSG), Enterprise Singapore (ESG) and other sectoral development agencies, as well as NTUC’s Employment and Employability Institute. The LED Scheme aims to make transformation and innovation more pervasive among enterprises of different sizes and across different sectors. We have made good progress so far. As at September 2018, over 11,000 enterprises have tapped on the LED Scheme.Usage of the LED Scheme is broad-based. The top three sectors – Construction, Food Services, and Wholesale Trade – account for about a third of the enterprises which have benefitted from the scheme. The others come from a diverse range of industries, and include many traditional businesses. We do not use a single metric to assess the impact of LED projects. This is because the LED Scheme supports a range of objectives and outcomes, depending on the transformation needs of enterprises. For example, enterprises that are just starting their productivity journey may receive funding support to procure ready-to-go productivity solutions identified by economic agencies. Enterprises looking to build deeper capabilities may partner agencies to develop more customised technology solutions or business process improvements. Others may receive support to redesign jobs, for example, to ensure that older workers can continue to be productively employed. Together with other initiatives to promote industry and business transformation, the LED Scheme has contributed to Singapore’s productivity growth of 2.6% per annum over the last two years, and real income growth of 4.0% per annum and 5.4% per annum at the median and P20 levels respectively.We will continue to work with industries, industry associations and enterprises to grow businesses in a manpower-lean manner, which would in turn help create better employment outcomes for Singaporeans. "
appeals by singaporeans aged 62 and above to use medisave beyond withdrawal limit,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Health in the past two years (a) how many Singaporeans aged 62 and above have made an appeal to use their Medisave beyond the withdrawal limit; (b) how many of these appeals have been successful; (c) whether the Ministry can review and increase the withdrawal limit; and (d) whether the withdrawal limit can be lifted for those aged 80 and above.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Over the past two years, MOH received about 200 appeals from patients aged 62 and above to use their MediSave monies beyond the prevailing withdrawal limits. These appeals are considered on a case-by-case basis, taking into account factors such as the need for more complex treatments, unforeseen complications, and financial difficulties that make it hard for the family to pay the outstanding bill. About half of the appeals were approved.  The MediSave withdrawal limits are set to be sufficient for the vast majority of subsidised healthcare expenses, after government subsidies and MediShield Life payouts. In 2017, MediShield Life and MediSave together were able to cover about 92% of the post-subsidy bill for inpatient hospitalisation and day surgeries. For seniors aged 80 and above, more than 7 in 10 hospitalisations in subsidised wards did not require any cash payment, and more than 8 in 10 paid less than $100 in cash. There are no plans at present to lift the withdrawal limit. We do, however, recognise that the elderly have greater need for healthcare. In recent years, we have enhanced outpatient subsidies and introduced MediShield Life, and these have improved affordability for all Singaporeans, especially the elderly. We have also introduced targeted initiatives, such as the Pioneer Generation Package, specifically for the elderly. As for MediSave withdrawals, we just raised the annual MediSave limit for outpatient chronic treatments from $400 to $500 in June this year. At the same time, we lowered the minimum age under the Flexi-MediSave scheme from age 65 to 60, so that more Singaporeans can use up to another $200 of MediSave flexibly each year for outpatient care.MOH will continue to monitor the affordability of subsidised care. Any further increases in MediSave withdrawal limits, whether for outpatient or inpatient care, should be considered very carefully and balanced against the longer term sustainability of MediSave accounts to serve the needs of Singaporeans. We will also continue to consider appeals for usage of MediSave above the withdrawal limits and extend MediFund to those who need additional financial assistance."
arson linked to illegal moneylending,Mr Ang Wei Neng asked the Minister for Home Affairs for the past five years including the first eight months of this year (a) how many cases of arson relating to illegal moneylending have been reported; (b) how many cases have been solved involving the arrest of the (i) culprits who set the fire and (ii) master mind behind the arson; and (c) whether the Ministry can consider increasing the punishment for crimes involving arson and illegal moneylending.,"Mr K Shanmugam: From 2013 to 2017, about 170 cases of unlicensed moneylending (UML) harassment involving the use of fire were reported to the Police. For the first eight months of this year, about 13 cases were reported. Overall, there is a steady decline in harassment involving the use of fire. There were about 20 cases in 2017, compared to about 50 in 2015. The Police have solved about 80% of the cases from 2013 till the present. This year, the Police have solved all the nine cases reported between January and July 2018; investigations into the cases reported in August are ongoing. In 2016 and 2017, the Police crippled at least 10 UML syndicates through the arrest of more than 70 persons.  The Member asked if MHA would consider increasing the punishment for crimes involving arson and illegal money lending. There are currently no plans to do so, as the penalties are adequate. Under the Moneylenders Act, offenders found guilty of acting on behalf of an unlicensed moneylender, committing or attempting to commit any acts of harassment, where there is property damage or hurt caused to another person, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, as well as caning of not less than six and not more than twelve strokes, and shall also be liable for a fine of between $5,000 and $50,000. Repeat offenders are liable for enhanced punishments. In a recent case in November 2017, Police arrested a 29-year old man for committing a series of UML harassment, including setting fire to two debtors' residence. He was subsequently convicted and sentenced to three years' imprisonment and ten strokes of the cane.The Police regularly review their strategies to keep the UML situation under control. This includes stepping up enforcement efforts, enhancing public education and leveraging the community to fight the UML scourge together. Footage from Police cameras have also been used to solve UML related cases. Police will continue to take a tough approach to clamp down on all manner of UML activities."
recourse for children with chronic conditions who are refused health insurance and are not eligible for medifund,"Ms Irene Quay Siew Ching asked the Minister for Health with regard to children with chronic conditions who are refused health insurance and are not eligible for Medifund due to income criteria, what recourse do these children have should they come down with other chronic diseases unrelated to their existing illness and which requires financial aid.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Regardless of whether they have private health insurance, all children can benefit from Government healthcare subsidies as well as tap on Medisave and they are all covered under MediShield Life. Those who need additional financial assistance can also apply for Medifund.Singaporean children, including those with chronic conditions, would receive subsidies of up to 75% at polyclinics and Specialist Outpatient Clinics. Those who require inpatient care can receive up to 80% subsidy at our public hospitals. Children who are Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) cardholders can enjoy up to $480 annually in subsidies for treatment of chronic conditions at participating CHAS GP clinics. CHAS subsidies for managing chronic disease will soon be extended to all Singaporeans. On top of Government subsidies, Medisave can help pay for chronic disease bills under the Chronic Disease Management Programme (CDMP). Since 2015, all Singaporean newborns receive a $4,000 Medisave Grant for Newborns, and so even newborns would have Medisave balances they can tap on. Children who do not have enough Medisave and those with higher medical bills can tap on the Medisave accounts of their parents.MediShield Life covers all Singaporean children from birth, including those with congenital and neonatal conditions, regardless of whether they have private health insurance. Hence, parents can claim MediShield Life payouts for their children if they are hospitalized or require dialysis and chemotherapy for cancer.Medifund provides a safety net to help those who are unable to afford their healthcare bill, even after Government subsidies, MediShield Life and Medisave. Eligibility for Medifund is determined by the individual Medifund committees of each institution, taking into account factors such as the patient's financial background and the bill size. They have the flexibility to extend Medifund assistance to middle income patients facing extenuating circumstances."
applications for financial assistance scheme in past five years,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Education (a) in the past five years, how many applications under the Financial Assistance Scheme have been received by the Ministry; (b) how many of these applications have been successful; (c) what are the reasons for the unsuccessful cases; and (d) whether the per capita income criterion can be reviewed and the per capita income increased so as to extend assistance to more students from the middle- and low-income families.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: Education in Singapore is highly subsidised at all levels, and the Government provides a range of financial assistance schemes to those who are in need, so that no one is deprived of education because of their financial circumstances. The MOE Financial Assistance Scheme (MOE FAS) for Singaporean students is designed to support school-going students from the low income families. To benefit more students, MOE has raised the income eligibility cap for the MOE FAS from Gross Household Income (GHI) of $2,500 or Per Capita Income (PCI) of $625, to GHI of $2,750 or PCI of $690 from 2018. There is no cap on the number of students who could receive the MOE FAS each year as all who meet the eligibility criteria will be awarded the MOE FAS. About 51,000 Singaporean students are currently receiving benefits from MOE FAS. In addition, the Edusave Merit Bursary is given to students from lower and middle income families who have performed well and meet the income criteria.   For students who require financial aid but do not qualify for the MOE FAS, the schools will assess and provide help through the school-based financial assistance. MOE provides schools with additional resources to manage this additional aid provision. "
achievement of key performance indicators for skillsfuture study awards,Ms Irene Quay Siew Ching asked the Minister for Education what are the key performance indicators and the percentage of these indicators that have been met under the $19.91 million programme for the SkillsFuture FY17/18 study awards.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: The SkillsFuture Study Awards encourage Singaporeans to develop and deepen specialist skills in areas of demand. They are nominated and awarded by government agencies overseeing various sectors. As at September 2018, about 2,300 study awards have been given out over the last two years across 40 areas of specialisation such as Air Transport, Early Childhood Care & Education, Infocomm Technology and Logistics. We will monitor the training outcomes of award recipients after they have completed their course of study. These could include expanded job responsibilities or enhanced job performance resulting from the training. However, this data is not yet available as most award recipients either are still pursuing, or have only recently completed, their training. We intend to make public the information once they are available."
jumbo flats as category separate from that of 4-room flats for hdb rental,Mr Ong Teng Koon asked the Minister for National Development whether HDB will consider jumbo flats as a separate category from 4-room flats in setting the occupancy cap for renting out HDB flats.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: As HDB flats primarily serve to meet the housing needs of flat owners and their family members, there is no limit imposed on the number of family members who can live together in an HDB flat. HDB only imposes an occupancy cap on flat owners who rent out their flat or bedrooms to unrelated persons. The occupancy cap minimises dis-amenities caused by overcrowding in our public estates, and maintains a conducive living environment for all residents. From 1 May 2018, the occupancy cap for 4-room and larger flats, including jumbo flats, was revised to six persons. This is aligned to the occupancy cap for private residential properties of all sizes. Nevertheless, should flat owners need to exceed the occupancy cap when renting out their flat or bedrooms, HDB may exercise flexibility based on the circumstances of each case."
simplifying process of cross-jurisdictional recognition of authenticity of documents issued by public authorities,"Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Law whether the Government intends to sign the Hague Convention Abolishing the Requirement of Legalisation of Foreign Public Documents 1961 (""Hague Apostille Convention"") so as to rationalise the current practice of legalising public documents by consular officers and simplify the process of cross-jurisdictional recognition of the authenticity of documents issued by public authorities in Singapore and, if not, what is the reason.","Mr K Shanmugam: The Ministry of Law is currently studying the Hague Apostille Convention to determine the implications of Singapore signing on to it. We are consulting with domestic agencies and stakeholders to find out their concerns about the Convention. We have also engaged in discussions with representatives from the Hague Conference, as well as agencies from Contracting Parties to the Convention, about the practicalities involved in implementing the Convention.  "
ensuring new opportunities and job roles from automation will be equally distributed to all workers,Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is being done to ensure that the new opportunities and job roles brought about by automation will be equally distributed across all affected workers; (b) whether there are plans for the Government to partner private companies to develop more training programmes to help affected industries make the transition; and (c) how many people have upskilled themselves in the past three years tapping on the Government schemes.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: Technology is quickening the pace of restructuring and transformation in every sector. To remain relevant, businesses and workers have to be agile, and take full advantage of the opportunities that technology brings. This includes implementing automation solutions where useful to improve productivity, overcome manpower shortages and expand growth potential.  The Government supports these efforts through a broad range of programmes, many of which also help to equip existing workers to effectively handle the new technologies implemented by their employers. With improved productivity, there has also been broad-based wage growth benefiting many workers. From 2012 to 2017, the real income of full-time employed Singaporeans rose by 3.9% per annum at the median and 4.3% at the 20th percentile. We recognise that some workers may be displaced as a result of restructuring. Through the Adapt and Grow (A&G) initiative, Workforce Singapore (WSG) and NTUC's Employment and Employability Institute (e2i) offer employment facilitation services such as career coaching, employability workshops, job fairs and job matching. These initiatives help jobseekers get back to work and have opportunities to progress further. Supported by robust job creation in the economy, unemployment rates have remained low while employment levels remained high.Under A&G, there are now over 100 Professional Conversion Programmes (PCPs) in over 30 sectors and around 50 other Place-and-Train (PnT) programmes that provide wage and training support for employers to re-train workers to take up new jobs or move into sectors with better job prospects. Since 2016, more than 11,600 individuals have been placed in new jobs or careers through PCP and PnT programmes.  Where possible, we intervene upstream before workers are retrenched. Sector agencies closely monitor industry developments and work with WSG to help companies reskill their workers to meet emerging needs. For example, with MAS's support, WSG and the Institute of Banking and Finance (IBF) developed the PCP for Consumer Banking to re-skill about 3,000 PMETs over the next two years. This will enable bank employees such as those in bank teller and operational roles to be redeployed to new functions such as digital marketing and relationship management, instead of being retrenched. For the Information and Communication Technology sector, WSG is working with HP Singapore and the Institute of Systems Science (ISS) to re-skill existing employees through the PCP for Data Analysts. This will enable employees, such as those in procurement and sourcing, to use data analytics to improve operations efficiency and stay relevant to their employers. Such programmes demonstrate how workers affected by business transformation can also gain from the new job opportunities created.In addition to WSG's efforts to help displaced and at-risk workers, a wide range of SkillsFuture programmes is also available to help our workforce deal with disruptions in the economy. For example, under the SkillsFuture Series, our Institutes of Higher Learning have launched various training programmes in eight emerging and priority domain areas including Advanced Manufacturing, Data Analytics, and Urban Solutions, that will help equip our workforce with the skills needed for jobs in the future economy. Training is heavily subsidised with enhanced funding support for mid-career individuals, low-wage workers and employees of SMEs. Many of them are delivered with private sector partners. Where appropriate, such partnerships will continue to be pursued. We are encouraged that our workers have been upskilling themselves through training and upgrading, with the training participation rate for the resident labour force increasing from 35% in 2015 to 48% in 2017. The number of participants in MOE/SSG-funded training programmes increased from 360,000 in 2015 to 430,000 in 2017.  "
singaporeans aged 65 and above who have remained in bankruptcy beyond five years,Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for Law (a) what is the current number of Singaporeans aged 65 and above who have remained in bankruptcy beyond five years; (b) what is the number of such Singaporeans who have made bankrupt by Government agencies; and (c) what are these agencies.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The bankruptcy regime is designed to balance the interests of individual debtors, creditors, and the wider society. It seeks to ensure that bankrupts deal with their debts as best as possible while allowing them to make a fresh start in their financial matters after a reasonable period of time.As at end October 2018, there were 964 Singapore citizens aged 65 and above who had been in bankruptcy for over five years1. This comprises around 6% of the overall number of bankrupts in Singapore. Most of these individuals became bankrupt before they reached 65 years of age. Of the 964 individuals, Government agencies were the petitioning creditors for 37 individuals. The agencies involved were HDB, MOM (Controller of Work Permits), IRAS (Comptroller of Income Tax) and the Land Office (the predecessor of Singapore Land Authority).Government agencies would first make several requests for payment. They will also see what other methods are possible to recover arrears. When these avenues fail, or are not feasible, then a petition for bankruptcy will be filed. Agencies not infrequently come across individuals who will not pay unless action is taken. Monies owed are taxpayers' money and agencies owe a duty to take steps to recover them.  Bankrupts may be discharged after a reasonable period of time. To help rehabilitate bankrupts, MinLaw has implemented the differentiated discharge framework since 1 Aug 2016. This framework provides timeframes and goals for bankrupts to meet to be eligible for a discharge. The bankrupt’s eligibility for discharge will depend on whether he has met his Target Contribution to the bankruptcy estate. The new framework allows bankrupts who pay their target contributions expeditiously, to be eligible for an earlier discharge.Should any individual face difficulty paying their target monthly contributions due to extenuating circumstances, they are encouraged to inform the Official Assignee. The OA who will take these circumstances into account in administering the bankruptcy. Any repayment under the bankruptcy regime also takes into account the need for the debtor to fulfil his basic necessities. The OA may reduce the monthly contributions of a bankrupt person if he can show that his personal circumstances have changed and he can no longer pay the previously agreed monthly contribution. The bankrupt person may also be eligible for an earlier discharge if the OA is satisfied that he is unable to pay his target contribution due to extenuating circumstances.  "
employment rate for differently-abled persons in last three years,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what is the employment rate for differently-abled persons in the last three years; (b) whether there are statistics on which groups of differently-abled persons are the most affected by unemployment and why; and (c) given the diversity of our society, whether matters affecting differently-abled groups are reported on and considered before a Bill is passed and, if not, whether there is a need for a governmental body to do so.","Mr Desmond Lee: It was estimated that more than 8,600 persons with disabilities were employed in the private and public sector in 2017. This was an increase of nearly 9% from the figure in 2015. The Ministry of Social and Family Development and the Department of Statistics will also be collecting more information on PWDs through the upcoming population census in 2020 which will provide further information and more accurate data on PWDs. Like many of us, the challenges faced by different persons with disabilities during their journey towards employment could be unique to their circumstances, as this is dependent on the individual’s readiness and their prospective employers’ expectation. To maximise the potential of persons with disabilities and empower them to participate fully in society, we are working closely with employers to help them build inclusive working environments and to redesign jobs for persons with disabilities. For example, the School-to-Work Transition programme aims to support SPED students who are assessed to be work-capable to transition from school to employment. It has helped 120 Special Education students thus far, and will be fully rolled out to Special Education schools by 2019.Before Bills are introduced by the Government, the ministry introducing the Bill consults other ministries, to ensure that the Bill has taken into account relevant perspectives. Apart from the Government departments, the consultation could be extended to an identified group of stakeholders, which could include members of the public, and representatives from both the private and people sector. As the Member would know, after the introduction and first reading of the Bill in Parliament, the bill is circulated to every Member of Parliament, and Members of Parliament can raise questions on the bill in the process and propose amendments. The process provides ample avenue for input to be considered before any Bill is passed, without the need for a separate governmental body to be established."
complaints against employers for overinflating employees’ salaries,"Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar asked the Minister for Manpower over the past five years (a) how many workers have lodged a complaint against their employers for overinflating their salaries where the actual amount they receive as salary is actually lower than that declared to the Ministry or stated on their pay slip; and (b) among those who complained, how many are (i) workers above the age of 60 years old (ii) blue collar workers (iii) PMEs and (iv) foreign workers respectively.","Mrs Josephine Teo: In the past five years, MOM received an average of around 8,300 claims annually from employees that they received a lower salary than the rightful amount due. They constitute 0.2% of the workforce. Fewer than one in 10 were above 60 years old. More than eight in 10 were rank-and-file workers, while the remaining were professionals, managers and executives (PMEs). Slightly over half of the claimants were foreign workers. Since its inception in 2017, the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM) has handled salary-related disputes of both local and foreign employees. In 2017, about eight in 10 cases were settled amicably through mediation. The remaining cases were forwarded to the Employment Claims Tribunals (ECT) for adjudication. To date, TADM and ECT have helped about 90% of employees with salary claims recover their salaries in full. In the course of mediating a salary claim or through pro-active inspections, MOM may uncover evidence that the employer has falsely declared inflated salaries so as to enjoy foreign work pass privileges. MOM will not hesitate to take action against such employers under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act. Since 2013, about 70 employers have been dealt with annually, with penalties ranging from imprisonment, fines, administrative financial penalties to warnings.  "
distortion of market prices given minimum built-up area requirement for private properties,Mr Ong Teng Koon asked the Minister for National Development whether stipulating a minimum built-up area of 85 sqm for private properties will distort market prices.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: To clarify, our guidelines do not stipulate a minimum built-up area for private properties. Instead, we impose a limit on the maximum number of units that developers can build in a development, to manage potential strains on local infrastructure and safeguard the livability of residential estates. Within these limits, developers still have the flexibility to provide a range of unit sizes to meet the diverse needs of home buyers.To calculate the maximum number of units that developers can build in each development, the maximum permissible gross floor area of the development is divided by an average unit size. In the recently announced changes to the guidelines, this average unit size was increased from 70 sqm to 85 sqm for all private properties outside the Central Area, and to 100 sqm for selected locations. As the guideline changes were only announced last month and will only take effect in January next year, it would be premature to conclude whether the changes have had any impact on market prices. Moreover, property prices depend on many factors beyond the guidelines. These include developers' bidding behaviour for land, homebuyers' evolving demand for units of various sizes, as well as how developers adjust the mix of unit sizes for upcoming projects to cater to demand, just to name a few. We will continue to monitor the distribution of unit sizes in residential developments, and review the guidelines periodically, taking into account factors such as infrastructure load, as well as changes in lifestyle and housing needs. "
actions against illegal moneylenders who advertise using sms or other forms of electronic communication,"Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for Home Affairs since 2014, what actions have been taken by the Police in relation to complaints regarding illegal moneylenders advertising for loans via SMS messages or other forms of electronic communication.","Mr K Shanmugam: Members of the public who receive unsolicited advertisement from unlicensed moneylenders (""UML"") in the form of SMS messages or other forms of communications should not reply to these messages. Those with information on unlicensed moneylenders can call the Police hotline at 1800-255-0000 or the National Crime Prevention Council's X Ah Long hotline at 1800-924-5664. All information given to the Police will be kept confidential.The Police take a strong stance against unlicensed moneylending activities and will not hesitate to take swift action against persons found to be engaging in them. Police regularly conduct major operations against UML syndicates to cripple them. From 2014 to September 2018, Police have arrested more than 6,900 persons in connection with UML activities. We will also continue with public education on unlicensed moneylending. In 2017 and 2018, the 3rd Anti-Unlicensed Moneylending media campaign was conducted. Besides educating the public on the dangers of borrowing from unlicensed moneylenders, this campaign provided advisories on how to deal with unsolicited unlicensed moneylending advertisements."
validity period of doctors' letters certifying condition of patient for lasting power of attorney,"Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked the Minister for Social and Family Development with regard to the Lasting Power of Attorney (a) whether the validity period of doctors' letters certifying the condition of the patient is uniformly accepted by all banks, insurance companies and Government agencies; and (b) if not, whether the Ministry will consider standardising the validity period to reduce inconvenience and hardship for affected families.","Mr Desmond Lee: A Lasting Power of Attorney can only be used on behalf of a person, if the person has lost mental capacity. If the doctor's medical report states that this mental capacity loss is permanent, there is no limit on the validity period of the medical report. If the loss is temporary, the validity is subject to the person's condition, and respective third parties' due diligence requirements based on their risk assessment. As such, the Ministry cannot standardise the validity period of medical reports stating temporary loss of mental capacity. HDB, insurance companies under the Life Insurance Association Singapore, and banks under the Association of Banks in Singapore would apply a 6-month validity period."
smart technology and elderly-friendly features for hdb flats under home improvement programme ii,"Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for National Development for Home Improvement Programme II, whether HDB will consider the use of (i) smart technology for toilet flushes and (ii) single-lever taps for wash basins to make it more user-friendly for the elderly.","Mr Lawrence Wong: The Home Improvement Programme II, or HIP II, is a second round of upgrading for our HDB flats at the 60th to 70th year mark to keep the flats safe and liveable to the end of their lease. It will be launched in about 10 years’ time, and focus on common maintenance issues which occur in ageing flats.   At present, single-lever taps for wash basins are provided under the HIP, as part of toilet upgrading. We will study the specific scope of works for HIP II, including the Member's suggestions, closer to the launch of the programme, taking into consideration user needs, long term maintenance issues and fiscal sustainability.  "
outlets found selling liquor beyond specified trading hours and outside of licensed premises,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is the number of outlets found selling liquor beyond the specified trading hours and outside of the licensed premises within the Liquor Control Zone in Little India since 1 April 2015; (b) what actions have been taken against these outlets and the persons-in-charge; and (c) what plans does the Ministry have to curb such violations.,"Mr K Shanmugam: Since 1 April 2015, 32 liquor outlets within the Liquor Control Zone (""LCZ"") in Little India have been found supplying liquor beyond the specified trading hours or outside the licensed premises.Licensees that breach their licence conditions face fines of up to $10,000 and suspension or cancellation of their licence. Police are also working with licensees to increase awareness of their regulatory obligations. Such efforts could include placing signages within their outlet to highlight, for example, the restriction in trading hours. "
impact of comprehensive and progressive agreement for the trans-pacific partnership on singapore’s trade and gnp,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Trade and Industry with the coming into force of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) on 30 December 2018 (a) what will be its near and long-term importance on Singapore's trade and GNP; (b) how can our companies take advantage of the CPTPP; and (c) how does it impact Enterprise Singapore's and Economic Development Board's strategies.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: To date, seven countries have ratified the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), which will enter into force on 30 December 2018. The CPTPP will expand Singapore’s economic space and promote new sources of growth for trade and investment. Singapore’s total exports and GDP can each potentially increase by up to 0.2% as a result.1  These gains are in addition to the benefits we enjoy from our extensive network of Free Trade Agreements with many of the CPTPP members. We also expect deeper economic and trade activities with Mexico and Canada, the two CPTPP countries with which Singapore does not have existing FTAs.The CPTPP will make it easier for our companies to do business in the region. It will boost trade and investment flows and integrate the region into a single manufacturing base and market, allowing Singapore companies to operate more seamlessly across the CPTPP countries. There are a number of opportunities for our businesses. First, Singapore-based goods producers will gain from the substantial elimination of tariffs and non-tariff barriers when exporting to the CPTPP markets. Second, service providers will enjoy preferential market access in a wide range of sectors such as professional services, telecommunications, transport, and energy. Third, investors will benefit from the removal of restrictions on foreign equity, as well as improvements in investment protection. Fourth, enterprises will be able to bid for more government procurement contracts in jurisdictions which were previously closed to foreign companies.  Beyond these direct benefits, the CPTPP also establishes a common set of enforceable rules that address modern trade and investment issues. Specifically, setting rules and standards in new areas such as e-commerce and intellectual property would foster innovation and the creation of new industries. The Agreement also aims to promote inclusive trade, with specific provisions that support small and medium enterprises, including through capacity building activities.The CPTPP is aligned with the strategies of the Ministry of Trade and Industry, as well as our economic agencies including Enterprise Singapore and the Economic Development Board. The CPTPP provides a platform for Singapore companies to strengthen their export networks and access opportunities overseas, through tariff reductions and ensuring a level playing field across the Asia-Pacific markets. This reinforces our ongoing efforts to enhance Singapore’s connectivity and help our companies grow through internationalisation. With the CPTPP, we will be well-positioned to continue attracting companies from diverse and innovative industries to set up, grow and create new businesses from Singapore. MTI is working with ESG and EDB to increase awareness of the CPTPP and help companies fully utilise its benefits."
update on community mental health master plan,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the status of the Community Mental Health Master Plan launched in 2017; (b) with the need for upstream prevention to promote mental well being, whether research has been done on the effectiveness of mental health education in countries with mandatory mental health literacy programmes in schools; and (c) whether there is a plan to study the impact of mental health on skills, productivity and innovation.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Ministry of Health (MOH) has been working with healthcare institutions and professionals to implement the community mental health plan since its launch in 2017. One key emphasis is to make care in the community more accessible for persons with mental health conditions and dementia. As at June 2018, mental health and/or dementia services are available at 10 of our polyclinics. This will increase to 12 polyclinics (or half our polyclinics) by 2021. In addition, 155 General Practitioner (GP) partners have been trained to diagnose and support persons with mental health conditions. These GPs are in turn supported by 19 trained community intervention teams, that enhance care for persons with mental health conditions through allied health services such as counselling. The Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) has also established a network of 34 community outreach teams, to reach out to persons with depression or dementia. These teams also carry out public education programmes to raise awareness on mental health and dementia conditions. To complement these outreach efforts, we have established six Dementia Friendly Communities (DFC) to create an inclusive and supportive environment for persons with dementia and their caregivers. I understand that internationally, mandatory mental health school programmes are still in the nascent stage. Various initiatives have been implemented in our schools to promote the understanding of mental health. For example, the Health Promotion Board (HPB) offers psycho-emotional programmes in schools to promote mental health literacy.  On the impact of mental health conditions on different aspects of life, the National Council of Social Service (NCSS) conducted a study in 2016 to better understand the quality of life of persons with mental health conditions. Persons with mental health conditions surveyed expressed desires for improvement in their psychological well-being, level of independence and social relationships. In particular, a significant number were keen on employment. In the 2017 NCSS Study on Attitudes towards Persons with Mental Health Conditions in Singapore, negative attitudes from co-workers were found to be a major barrier to employing people recovering from mental health conditions. A follow-up study by NCSS found that implementing workplace adjustments, such as increasing work support and supervision, training of supervisors and managers, will facilitate the employment of persons with mental health conditions. The Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices state that employers should recruit employees on the basis of merit. The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) treat workplace discrimination seriously and workers who face any form of workplace discrimination should promptly report the matter to MOM or TAFEP. "
effectiveness of progressive wage model versus minimum wage model for needs of low-wage workers,Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how has the Progressive Wage Model (PWM) resulted in more desirable outcomes than the Minimum Wage Model; and (b) what changes are being considered for PWM to address the needs of low-wage workers.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: The Progressive Wage Model (PWM) provides a clear progression ladder for workers to earn higher and sustainable wages as they become more skilled, more productive and take on higher job responsibilities. Each PWM is developed through extensive tripartite consultations, taking into consideration sector-specific issues such as past and prevailing wages, working conditions and the required skills for the relevant jobs.  Over 70,000 resident workers in over 1,600 companies have benefited since the PWM was implemented in the cleaning, security and landscaping sectors. Workers in these sectors have seen higher real wage growth than at the median. Between 2011 and 2016, the real median gross wages of full-time resident cleaners, security guards and landscape maintenance employees increased by 5.7%, 6.4% and 3.0% per year respectively. This was higher than resident median income growth of 2.3% per year.It is important to recognise that the PWM is implemented in the context of a much wider programme of wage support through the Workfare Income Supplement scheme. Workfare reflect our approach of going beyond the debate on minimum wages – one that economists still cannot agree on after decades – to find a way forward that works for Singapore. Workfare payouts are targeted at those with poor household support with more going to older workers. It can comprise up to an extra 30 per cent of the worker's monthly income, topping up salaries of low-wage workers and helping them save for retirement. Over the past decade, about 830,000 Singaporeans have benefited from the $5.5 billion disbursed. Together with Workfare, as well as other initiatives like Silver Support Scheme and GST vouchers, PWM has helped uplifted wages and incomes of lower-wage workers while keeping employment levels high and unemployment levels low.Tripartite partners will continue to review the PWMs in each sector periodically to ensure that they remain relevant in uplifting workers, and are aligned with the sectors' industry transformation goals. For example, over the last two years, tripartite partners in the cleaning and security sectors announced PWM enhancements, and are reviewing the PWM for the landscape maintenance employees. Tripartite partners also announced a PWM for lift and escalator maintenance to attract and retain more skilled workers into the sector to build a strong local core workforce in the lift industry."
minimising inconvenience and improving preparedness for enhanced security screening at mrt stations,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Transport with regard to the trial on enhanced security screening at MRT stations (a) how will the Ministry minimise inconvenience and delays to commuters; and (b) how the preparedness of transport operators be further improved in the face of security threats.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Security screening at MRT stations is not new to commuters. Since 2004, commuters have been subjected to random bag checks at all MRT stations. It is timely to review and update our security measures given that our public transport system has expanded significantly and remains a soft target for perpetrators who wish to do us harm. We are therefore trialling person screening using walk through metal detectors and X-ray machines. The six-month trial is necessary to allow LTA and PTOs to fine-tune the security operations, and develop the capability to step up our response against heightened security threats, when the situation warrants. During this period, commuters at selected stations will be subjected to the new search process. Security screening will lengthen travel time. This is the balance we have to strike between public safety and efficiency. As commuters become more familiar with the screening process, we expect additional time taken to be kept to a minimum. We have chosen to start the trial over the year-end holiday period so that affected commuters can be sensitised to it before the start of the new year. We are also mindful that there are various groups of commuters whom we need to pay special attention to, including students sitting for their GCE ‘A’ Level examinations, so that help can be rendered if necessary.The Public Transport Security Committee (PTSC) constantly reviews security threats to our public transport network, and calibrates the security measures accordingly, leveraging technology where applicable. LTA and the PTOs conduct regular security and emergency exercises involving 100% checks to test our preparedness and response against security threats. This year, we conducted two exercises, one at Newton MRT station and the other at Holland Village MRT station. The third exercise will be carried out in December at Hougang MRT station. Such exercises are crucial to ensure the security preparedness of our PTOs and relevant agencies, and to help commuters familiarise with security protocols in the event of heightened security.   "
extent of doctors over-servicing patients,Mr Seah Kian Peng asked the Minister for Health what is the extent of doctors over-servicing patients and what measures are in place to address this.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: It is difficult to accurately assess the prevalence of over-servicing. As an indicator, between 2013 to 2017, complaints of unnecessary or inappropriate treatment lodged with the Singapore Medical Council (SMC) averaged 19 each year. Several measures have been instituted to reduce over-servicing and encourage appropriate care. The Agency for Care Effectiveness (ACE) has developed a total of 39 guidances to-date on what constitute rational accepted clinical practice, and appropriate investigations and treatments. This include guidances on the appropriate usage of selected high cost medications, treatments and investigations such as indications for the use of PET-CT scans in managing cancer. The insurance industry has also started implementing measures to discourage over-servicing. Integrated Shield Plan (IP) insurers are developing or enhancing their pre-authorisation frameworks, where insurers would approve the medical treatment and estimated bill sizes prior to the actual procedures. This provides certainty to patients on what can be claimed under their insurance policy, while allowing insurers to assess the medical necessity of the treatment. IP insurers are also required to incorporate a co-payment of 5% or more into new IP riders from 8 March 2018. Co-payment in insurance is a key element that will encourage healthcare providers and policyholders to choose medically necessary and appropriate treatments for the patient's circumstances. When the SMC revised its Ethical Code and Ethical Guidelines (ECEG) in 2016, a specific section on ""Finances in Medical Practice"" was introduced. The ECEG states that in ""managing patients, a doctor must always place patients’ best interests above his personal interests and any business of financial considerations. The ECEG prohibits doctors from letting business or financial considerations influence the objectivity of their clinical judgement in their management of patients"". In March this year, SMC reminded all doctors about these ethical principles through a circular. All stakeholders have to play their part to avoid over-servicing, and keep healthcare affordable and sustainable for all Singaporeans. "
allowing cpf members to complete purchase of hdb flats by using retirement account funds,"Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Manpower what are the circumstances in which the CPF Board exercises its discretion to allow its members, who have turned 55 and do not have savings above their basic retirement sums in their Retirement Accounts, to complete the purchase of HDB flats using the monies in their Retirement Account and, in such situations, how much in percentage terms will be allowed to be withdrawn from the members' CPF accounts.","Mrs Josephine Teo: When a member turns 55, a Retirement Account (RA) is created for him. Funds in his Special Account (SA) are transferred to the RA. If the resulting RA balance is less than the Full Retirement Sum (FRS), the shortfall may be made up by a transfer from his Ordinary Account (OA) to his RA. The member could choose to withdraw the amount above Basic Retirement Sum (BRS) if he has sufficient property charge or pledge. Should the member need to reserve monies in his OA to service mortgage repayments, a request can be made to the CPF Board to withhold the transfer to RA. The RA funds earn interest and will eventually be used to provide the member with a stream of income. The OA continues to exist even after the RA is created, earning interest and receiving contributions if the member continues working. The fresh inflows to the OA can also be used for their housing needs. Members usually take into account their available OA and cash savings when deciding what HDB flat to purchase. With good planning, most members have sufficient funds to complete the HDB purchase. That said, CPF Board has exercised flexibility in exceptional cases. The Board takes into account member's retirement adequacy and outstanding loan amount in deciding whether an exception can be made. For example, the Board has, upon appeal, allowed CPF members to use their RA savings to pay for their housing, up to the amount that originated from their OA, even if this results in their RA savings dipping below the BRS. Overall, we need to strike a balance between allowing CPF members to use their RA savings for housing needs and safeguarding such savings for their retirement, so as not to compromise retirement adequacy."
regulation of sale and use of hidden cameras to reduce incidence of outrage of modesty or violation of privacy,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether there is a need to regulate the sale and use of spy or hidden cameras so as to reduce cases involving the outrage of modesty and violation of privacy.,"Mr K Shanmugam: Offences involving the use of spy or hidden cameras that insult the modesty of a person are taken seriously. Those found guilty are liable to imprisonment of up to one year, or a fine, or both. In this context, the Penal Code Review Committee (""PCRC"") has recommended introducing new offences specifically relating to the making, distribution, possession, and accessing of voyeuristic recordings. The PCRC has also recommended that offenders who make such recordings be liable to imprisonment of up to two years, or a fine, or both, and caning. This is a higher punishment than under current laws. The Government has completed its public consultation on the PCRC's recommendations, and will be amending the Penal Code early next year.It is quite unworkable to try and deal with the problem by banning spy cameras and hidden cameras. Mobile phones also come with cameras, and they can also be concealed to take secret photos or videos. We will increase the penalties and add new offences to try and deter the commission of such acts. "
express trains on new mrt lines,Mr Ong Teng Koon asked the Minister for Transport whether there are plans to implement express trains in new MRT lines.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Express services can reduce travel time for some commuters, but they will require a separate set of tracks and additional signalling systems. This will mean greater land take, pose operational complexities, and cost taxpayers and commuters significantly more. Sharing tracks for express and non-express services is technically possible, but non-express trains have to be held back at stations to allow express trains to pass. This will have significant adverse impact for commuters on the non-express services.Existing lines are designed to benefit the maximum number of people along their routes. Retrospectively implementing express services is not feasible. We will need to build parallel tracks very close to existing live tracks, which poses considerable operational risks. For new rail lines which are being developed, we did study the feasibility of including express lines. Specifically, we assessed the option of an express service between Jurong East and Changi Airport for the Cross-Island Line (CRL). However, less than 5% of CRL users will see significant time savings of at least 15 minutes. Viewed against the much higher cost and land take needed to build two additional tunnels for the express service, we did not pursue the option. "
companies that have taken up managing onsite vehicular safety (moves) programme,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Manpower with regard to the Managing Onsite Vehicular Safety (MOVeS) programme (a) how many companies have taken up the programme so far; (b) what are the main reasons for companies not embarking on the programme; and (c) what is the Ministry's plan to increase the take-up rate.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: The Managing Onsite Vehicular Safety (MOVeS) programme helps companies to develop effective traffic management plans and educates them on how to prevent work-related vehicular accidents.  MOVeS is a relatively new programme introduced in 2017. In 2017, the Ministry piloted the programme for 80 workplaces and increased it to 120 workplaces in 2018. There were more companies that could have benefited, but they declined to participate largely because they felt they already had in-house expertise in vehicular safety. These companies will nonetheless still be subject to MOM inspections. In the event of any accidents, they also remain accountable under the Workplace Safety and Health Act as employers or occupiers. To improve take-up, we will work with the WSH Council and trade associations (e.g. Singapore Contractors Association Limited, Singapore Logistics Association, and the Container Depot and Logistics Association Singapore) to promote the programme among their members and sub-contractors."
companies that have been helped by industry transformation maps,Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for Finance (a) how many companies have been helped by the Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) since the launch of the ITMs; (b) what are the delivered outcomes so far; and (c) how can the ITMs be scaled up to help more companies.,"Mr Heng Swee Keat: The development of Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) is one of the recommendations from the Committee on the Future Economy. The ITMs put in place a framework for partnership, bringing together industry stakeholders, including companies, trade associations and chambers (TACs), workers, unions, economic agencies and education institutions, to develop and implement a transformation plan for each of the 23 industries. The ITMs seek to sharpen the competitiveness of companies and industries here, and to enable our workers to deepen skills and increase productivity. In this way, companies and workers can continue to progress and enjoy the fruits of their efforts. In developing the ITMs, the Government plays an enabling role, bringing together all stakeholders to develop and implement the plans. The leaders of companies and industries play the critical role of developing the strategies for their companies and industries, and of seeking partnerships, within Singapore and with global partners, to develop deep capabilities. To transform successfully, companies need industry-specific and holistic solutions that span different areas from technology adoption to manpower training. ITMs allow us to work with companies in a coherent way. For example, the Job Redesign Initiative under the Environmental Services ITM helps cleaning and waste management companies adopt automation and digital solutions to improve productivity, and to redesign jobs so that workers can benefit from these changes. The various initiatives reinforce one other – for instance, redesigning jobs and processes, as companies adopt new technologies. As at the end of FY 2017, the Government has committed $1.7 billion to support companies. These funds have been deployed by agencies such as Enterprise Singapore (ESG) and the Economic Development Board (EDB) to support about 30,000 companies in FY2016 and FY2017. Industry transformation has to be pervasive and sustained. We cannot expect immediate results. But so far, we are glad that companies appreciate the need to change, and many are already taking action to do so. At the economy-wide level, we are seeing good productivity growth – in 2017, we achieved productivity growth of 4.5%. While we cannot attribute all of these to the industry transformation efforts, it is a step in the right direction. More detailed analyses are being done to assess the effectiveness of various initiatives.Clearly, as Mr Liang Eng Hwa alludes to, we need to scale up to ensure that even more companies can undertake the transformation effort. There are several initiatives that we are working on. One is to get industry stakeholders to work together to take charge of the transformation. While companies compete to differentiate themselves, they can also cooperate to solve common challenges, and share resources and facilities to achieve scale. Food manufacturers, for instance, can tap on the shared facilities available at the JTC Food Hub @ Senoko, launched in July this year. The Food Hub provides shared spaces, such as an integrated cold room and warehouse, as well as advanced food processing equipment, such as microwave-assisted thermal sterilisers. By sharing resources, each food manufacturer can lower his operating costs. They can also embark on research and development work together, which each alone will find too costly. Another way to bring more companies on board is for the Singapore Business Federation (SBF) and the various TACs to exercise leadership and bring companies together. For instance, the SBF is working closely with the various industry TACs to look into helping industries digitalise, through its Digitalisation Committee. The Committee has been working with Government agencies, such as the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA), to implement initiatives in key areas such as e-invoicing, e-commerce, and e-payments. Another example of how we are scaling up to help more companies is in the Logistics sector. Four TACs – the Container Depot and Logistics Association (Singapore) (CDAS), SAAA@Singapore, Singapore Logistics Association (SLA), and Singapore Transport Association (STA) – came together to form the Logistics Alliance as part of the Logistics ITM. The Alliance launched a Transport Integrated Platform (TRIP), which integrated several existing systems into a single digital platform to enable easier tracking of container trucks. This has helped logistics companies to increase productivity and reduce the idling time of their trucks. I look forward to the TACs' continued good work in accelerating transformation.  To conclude, the Government will support companies in industry transformation, as industry partners and TACs continue to work together to realise synergies and forge win-win partnerships. With everyone playing his part, I am optimistic that our companies and workers will benefit through industry transformation, as they have in the past."
mental wellness and resilience training for primary and secondary school students,Prof Fatimah Lateef asked the Minister for Education (a) whether there can be a more comprehensive and widespread incorporation of mental wellness and resilience training for students from primary and secondary schools; and (b) what are the roles of staff in the Psychology Division of the Ministry.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: Mental health is a global issue and internationally the figures are on the rise. The World Health Organisation projects that mental illness will account for 15% of global disease burden by 2020, up from 12% in the early 2000s, with young people in particular being susceptible. The factors affecting mental health are many and varied. Hence, the issue needs to be addressed on different fronts by different parties working together. For young people their main environments are home and school. Support from parents plays a big part as well as support from educators, peers and professional counsellors. On its part, MOE has stepped up efforts to support the mental well-being of students in our schools.To build mental wellness and resilience among the students in general we have been strengthening social-emotional learning through lessons and co-curricular programmes from Primary to Junior College. These include emotional regulation, perspective taking, impulse control, problem solving and various coping strategies. Health Promotion Board and other community agencies also organise mental health awareness talks and exhibitions for our students. To ensure that students with mental health issues have access to help, we have introduced at least one school counsellor in every school. Our school counsellors provide emotional support to students in distress, help them explore different perspectives and develop strategies to manage their personal, social and emotional issues. Where necessary, they will engage parents and work with relevant external agencies to strengthen the support net for the students. Teachers are also equipped to identify signs of distress in their students and check on their well-being. When any student needs professional intervention, the teachers will refer them to the school counsellor.  The Health Promotion Board provides mental health awareness briefings and resources for teachers and school counsellors annually. These enhance their understanding of mental health issues, its impact on students as well as provide strategies on how to support students better.Recognising that peer support also plays an important role as students typically turn to friends and peers when they have issues, we have in recent years been promoting peer support among students in all schools. The peer support programme encourages help-seeking behaviour, reduces stigmatisation of mental illnesses, and helps students to identify friends who are in distress for support.Professionals from a number of MOE Divisions work together to support the entire system from a mental health perspective. The educational psychologists and specialists design curriculum, programmes and resources, as well as conduct training and consultation for school personnel to implement the relevant programmes. The educational psychologists also provide assessment, case consultation and other specialised services to students with special educational needs. Where necessary, MOE will engage external expertise, including the mental health professionals and relevant social service agencies.  While schools can assist to the extent that the students are in school, support in the home environment and from parents is crucial as that is central to the students' lives. We have stepped up our engagement with parents to raise their awareness so that they can better understand and support the mental health needs of their children, and also provide them with information on where they can seek specialised help if needed."
achieving even spread of students from different socio-economic status in schools,"Mr Seah Kian Peng asked the Minister for Education whether it is desirable for schools to achieve an even spread of students from different socio-economic status and, if so, what are some of the measures that have been introduced or are being contemplated.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: Schools is a major national platform where Singaporeans from all walks of life get to mingle and build friendships. We do not set out to achieve an even distribution of students of different socio-economic backgrounds across schools. This is because it will mean a significant departure from current admission policy, which is based on various admission phases for primary one, and academic results, strengths or aptitudes for secondary school and beyond. Actively intervening to ensure an even spread of students across socio-economic backgrounds will change the bases for admission, quite fundamentally and I am not sure parents and students are ready for that.  Notwithstanding, we do not want our schools to become segregated, as it will reduce opportunity for social mixing and weaken Singapore's social fabric. Thus, we try to encourage as much mixing and mingling as possible. We adjusted primary and secondary school registration to ensure primary schools do not become closed circles. For Primary 1 registration, since 2014, 40 places are reserved in Phases 2B and 2C for children without prior connection to the primary school. For secondary schools, starting from the 2019 posting exercise, 20% of places for each course in every secondary school with an affiliated primary school will be reserved for students without affiliation. We are also enhancing the opportunities for mixing and interaction amongst students from diverse backgrounds within and across schools. Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) enable students to work and engage with peers from other schools. We revised the formats of the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) and National School Games to encourage combined school teams. For example, the SYF Celebrations 2018 saw the participation of 351 schools, of which 56 engaged in combined school performances. Another way is through outdoor learning. Since its implementation in 2017, the MOE-OBS Challenge Programme enabled about 17,000 Secondary Three students from different schools to come together in mixed school cohorts to experience the outdoors and overcome challenges together. I should emphasise that MOE is committed to ensure that all our schools are well-resourced, so that the learning needs of our students are met regardless of which school they go to. We will continue to provide timely interventions at all levels to students who require more help, such as levelling up programmes in literacy and numeracy skills, and additional after-school support through school-based Student Care Centres. Ultimately, our lower-SES students are not, and will not be worse-off in terms of learning and support provisions at any of our schools, and it remains MOE's duty and mission to ensure that every child is given a strong foundation to do well. "
singapore’s offer of humanitarian relief for crisis and famine in yemen,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether the Government will offer humanitarian relief to help alleviate the crisis and famine in Yemen.,"Dr Vivian Balakrishnan: Yemen has been torn by strife in recent years. The underlying roots of the current conflict are deep and complex. Critically, the conflict has become a breeding ground for terrorist and extremist groups. More recently, the Islamic State has established a foothold in Yemen, which heightens the risks of radicalisation. Alongside the threat of radicalisation, the humanitarian crisis in Yemen generated by the ongoing upheaval is also of serious concern for the international community. Between March 2015 and August 2018, the United Nation' Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights documented more than 17,000 civilian casualties, including more than 6,500 deaths. Prolonged fighting will worsen the humanitarian situation and create more security vacuums for terror groups to exploit. Therefore, we strongly encourage the key players involved to work towards a ceasefire and return to the negotiating table to find a political solution. There can be no lasting and durable peace without political negotiations and compromise. In the meantime, I am heartened to note that some of our community organisations have held various fundraising drives for the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. For example, the Rahmatan Lil Alamin Foundation, in partnership with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, organised a special fundraising effort at 71 mosques in July 2017 for the affected civilians in Yemen. Islamic Relief Singapore has an ongoing fundraising drive for Islamic Relief’s efforts to distribute food and provide emergency water. In 2016, the Arab Association Singapore partnered with the United Nations Development Programme on the initiative ""Yemen Our Home"", in order to support the rebuilding of infrastructure, skills training, and the empowerment of women in Yemen. These ground-up initiatives speak to the generosity of Singaporeans.The dire humanitarian situation will only improve once a durable ceasefire is in place, and reconstruction is only possible when the conflict is resolved. Singapore supports the work of UN Special Envoy Martin Griffiths in organizing peace talks to reach a political solution, which is the real key to alleviating the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. We continue to urge all parties to exercise utmost restraint and to work together towards a peaceful resolution of the conflict in Yemen."
employers who have participated in the business and institutions of a public character scheme,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Finance (a) how many employers have participated in the Business and Institutions of a Public Character Scheme and what is the total number of hours volunteered by employees based on rebates claimed to date; and (b) whether there is a plan for an ""Individual and Institutions of a Public Character Scheme"" to encourage more volunteerism by individuals beyond the tax rebate for donations.","Mr Heng Swee Keat: The Business and Institution of a Public Character (IPC) Partnership Scheme (BIPS) was introduced in July 2016 to encourage businesses to support their employees to offer their expertise and skills to IPCs. Through BIPS, businesses can enjoy a 250% tax deduction on basic wages and related expenses incurred when their employees volunteer or provide services to IPCs.Between July 2016 and December 2017, about 3,200 employees from 48 businesses contributed about 17,000 volunteering hours through BIPS projects. To encourage more businesses to come on board, we will continue to promote the scheme and simplify the claims process. For example, we will provide an option for businesses to claim tax deductions on wages based on a fixed man-hour rate. This will provide greater flexibility to businesses who may find it tedious to compute the pro-rated wages of employees who had volunteered. Ms Anthea Ong asked if similar tax deductions could be given to individuals to encourage volunteerism. The design of the scheme facilitates IPCs with specific needs to benefit from the expertise of staff in diverse businesses, including consultancy, legal and accounting services, courier services.We continue to encourage individuals to volunteer and contribute out of passion and heart for the community. Under the SG Cares movement, the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth, together with its partner agencies, support volunteerism through various ways. These include volunteer training, and matching of skills and passions to areas of need, to create a more fulfilling and engaging experience for volunteers. Individuals and corporates with outstanding contributions to the community are also recognised through awards, to inspire more to join them. Grants, such as Our Singapore Fund, are available to support ground-up projects which meet social or community needs.We will continue to review the effectiveness of our strategies and explore further ways of encouraging volunteerism, to build a caring society where the community steps forward to support one another.  "
follow-up monitoring and care for discharged mentally distressed patients,"Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Health (a) when a mentally distressed patient requiring continued medication and supervision is discharged, whether there is a follow up system to ensure that the patient will continue with the prescribed treatment; and (b) how does the Ministry follow up on such cases where there is no caregiver who is able to manage the patient adequately to ensure the necessary supervision and help.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Ministry of Health (MOH) works closely with our healthcare and community service providers to support persons with mental health conditions after they are discharged. Discharged patients who require further support in the community, can be referred to the community outreach teams for the necessary supervision and help. This includes persons with no caregivers. Typically, after a patient has been discharged from the hospital, an outpatient appointment to follow-up on the patient’s condition will be arranged. For patients with moderate or severe but stable mental health conditions, they would be case managed by the Institute of Mental Health (IMH). This involves post discharge monitoring, mainly through regular follow-up telephone calls and home visits, to ensure that patients attend their outpatient reviews and comply with medication. If required, patients can also be referred to other agencies and community outreach teams for social support.For patients who require more intensive follow up, IMH deploys multidisciplinary teams to the patients' homes to provide treatment and counselling. A 24-hour crisis intervention helpline service and mobile crisis team are available when their mental health issues escalate. To complement IMH's work in providing post-discharge care and follow-up, MOH has also been building the capability of healthcare professionals and community partners to provide better supervision, treatment and support for persons with mental health issues within the community. Together with the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC), the Aftercare Programme was implemented in 2015, in parts of the central and south of Singapore. The programme aimed to support clients' smooth transition from IMH into the community. In collaboration with the community mental health partners, IMH and AIC co-develop joint workflow and protocol to facilitate the referral of these clients, and also build the partners' mental health capability through training and case discussions. The Aftercare Programme has since expanded from the first site at Ang Mo Kio-Sin Ming, to Kembangan-Chai Chee and Kreta Ayer-Henderson sites as of end June 2018. "
adequacy of healthcare professionals with three medical schools fully established,Prof Fatimah Lateef asked the Minister for Health with our three medical schools now fully established and stabilised (a) how is Singapore meeting our needs for healthcare professionals; and (b) how is our population-to-doctor ratio doing compared to the last five years.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Ministry of Health regularly reviews our healthcare manpower needs taking into account population demographics and disease trends. We aim to build a strong local core of doctors to meet Singapore’s healthcare needs. In line with the Healthcare 2020 Masterplan, we increased our local medical intakes through the expansion of NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine and Duke-NUS Medical School, and the establishment of NTU Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine in 2013. Between 2012 and 2018, the total local medical intake increased by about 40%, from 354 to 500. The annual output of about 500 medical graduates from our local medical schools will contribute towards building a strong local core of doctors in our healthcare workforce. This will be supplemented by overseas-trained doctors, including Singaporeans returning to join our healthcare family.In Singapore, we had about 2.4 doctors per 1,000 population in 2017, a significant increase from 1.9 in 2012. Our ratio is higher than Hong Kong and Taiwan; comparable to those in South Korea and Japan; and lower than US and UK. We need to be cautious when comparing these ratios across healthcare systems and be mindful of the differences in healthcare models, operating environments, and national contexts."
proposal for installation of fire alarms at hdb blocks,"Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar asked the Minister for National Development whether a manual fire alarm can be installed at the lift lobby of every floor or at least at the ground floor lift lobby of each HDB block so as to allow residents to raise the alarm and notify other residents should any in-unit fire break out within the block, similar to what is provided in private residential or commercial buildings.","Mr Lawrence Wong: All HDB buildings are designed to meet the prevailing Fire Code requirements. For HDB residential blocks, each residential unit is designed to be a fire compartment, to prevent the spread of fire to adjacent units. In addition, various measures have been put in place to ensure the fire safety of HDB flats. These include the provision of fire-rated entrance doors, fire-resistant walls and floors, and installing dry/wet rising mains and fire lifts, where required, to facilitate fire-fighting.Under the Fire Code, manual fire alarm systems are not required for standalone residential blocks, be it HDB or private. The Fire Code requires each residential unit to be designed as a fire compartment, and so any outbreak of fire is limited to that affected unit. Hence there is generally no need for an entire block to evacuate in the event of a fire. However, for all buildings where residential uses are mixed with other uses, such as commercial, social-communal and car park use, fire alarm systems will be installed as and when required by the Fire Code."
computation of land cost in sale price of new hdb flats,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for National Development how is the land cost amount which is included in the sale price of a new HDB flat tabulated.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The key consideration in the pricing of HDB flats is to keep public housing affordable. That is why new HDB flats are priced substantially below the prices of comparable resale flats.  In particular, the average monthly instalment to income ratio for first-timer families buying new flats in non-mature estates is less than a quarter of applicants’ monthly income. This means that homebuyers will require little or no cash outlay.  The selling prices set by HDB for new flats cannot cover their development costs, which include construction and land costs.  That is why HDB incurs significant deficits every year in its home ownership programme. On top of the subsidised selling price, HDB also provides housing grants of up to $80,000 to give more help to lower and middle income families buying their first home. "
criteria to guide government funding support for start-ups,Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what criteria are used to guide Government funding support for start-ups; (b) how are the investments distributed across various sectors; and (c) how much is invested in deep-tech start-ups.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: Startups are an important driver of innovation and enterprise in our economy. The Government provides funding support to Singapore startups across different stages of their development.  In the early stages, Startup SG Founder provides capital grant to first-time entrepreneurs with innovative business ideas, while Startup SG Tech provides grant support for Proof-of-Concept and Proof-of-Value commercialisation of innovative, proprietary technologies. At this point, the uniqueness of the idea or product will be the main consideration.  For startups that are more mature and ready to receive institutional investment, funding support is provided through Startup SG Equity which co-invests with independent third-party investors. The private investors help assess the startup's commercial viability and the strength of its business model and management team. These co-investments cover both general tech and deep tech startups, across a range of sectors and domains such as Advanced Manufacturing & Engineering (AME), Health & Biomedical Sciences (HBMS), Urban Solutions & Sustainability (USS), and Services & Digital Economy (SDE). Between 1 April 2017 and 31 October 2018, the government has co-invested in a total of 62 startups under the Startup SG Equity scheme. The Government’s funding of S$43.8 million for these 62 startups catalysed S$50.3 million of private sector monies from their appointed co-investment partners. Around half of these investments were deployed into deep tech startups, and the rest into general tech startups. At Budget this year, the Government has also announced the NRF-Temasek IP Commercialisation Vehicle, which will co-invest in startups whose business models are underpinned by intellectual property generated from publicly funded research. NRF has committed to invest $50 million and Temasek has committed to co-invest at least $50 million into Singapore-based early-stage high tech companies. Growing a conducive environment for startups goes beyond funding support. Startups also need access to mentorship, talent, local and global networks, co-innovation platforms and infrastructure, in order to build their capabilities and grow. Hence, besides funding, the Government has put in place support to meet the non-financing needs of startups. Under Startup SG Infrastructure, startups have access to spaces that they need to grow, experiment and flourish. The strong network of startups, incubators and venture capitalists at LaunchPad@one-north generates opportunities for collaboration and accelerates the growth of startups. Under Startup SG Accelerator, the Government provides support to incubators and accelerators to take on the role of catalysing growth opportunities for high-potential startups through their programmes, mentorship and provision of resources. The Government also works closely with partners such as the Action Community for Entrepreneurship (ACE), SGInnovate and our universities to support the growth of startups in Singapore.Through these efforts, Singapore’s startup ecosystem is becoming more vibrant. Venture funding activity in Singapore has ramped up, from 80 deals worth US$136.4 million in 2012, to 174 deals worth US$1.37 billion in 2017. The Government will continue our efforts to make sure that we have an enabling, pro-enterprise environment for startups and that Singapore is the place of choice for startups in Asia."
impact of trade tensions between china and us on singapore’s growth and industries,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Trade and Industry with regard to the trade tensions between China and the United States (a) what are the implications of a lower economic growth forecast for 2019 and what can be done to mitigate it; (b) whether Singapore's exports have decreased over the last few months; (c) which industries are the hardest hit and how can they cope with this difficult period; and (d) whether the plans laid out in the Industry Transformation Maps are affected and require calibration.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: The impact of the trade tensions on the Singapore economy has been limited thus far. In the first three quarters of 2018, Singapore’s non-oil domestic exports (NODX) grew by 6.2 per cent on a year-on-year basis, with the third quarter of 2018 marking the eighth consecutive quarter of growth in NODX. Notwithstanding this, Singapore’s GDP growth is likely to moderate in 2019 on the back of an expected slowdown in growth in major advanced and regional economies such as the US, China and ASEAN-5 economies, in part due to the ongoing trade tensions.  The impact of the trade tensions on the Singapore economy will be felt most in externally-oriented sectors which are plugged into the US-China supply chains, such as the electronics and precision engineering clusters. However, there is potential for businesses to mitigate some of the impact by redirecting their exports of intermediate goods to other markets. In addition, there could be some offsetting effects when US and Chinese importers source more from the ASEAN region, including Singapore. Our economic agencies are working closely with businesses to identify any disruptions promptly, and facilitate link-ups with other suppliers and markets to restructure supply chains where necessary. Businesses can also leverage on the strong trading networks that we have developed over the years, as well as our extensive network of free trade agreements, to navigate the disruptions and seek out new opportunities and alternative suppliers and demand markets.The Government will continue to press on with efforts to help companies build the capabilities that they need to access new markets, on-board cutting-edge technologies, and create good jobs. The Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) are dynamic plans that will be updated to respond to changes in the economic environment. The Future Economy Council, comprising tripartite representatives, monitors the progress of our ITMs, and ensures that they continue to be relevant to emerging trends. The Council will monitor the situation and adjust the ITMs as the situation requires, in partnership with key stakeholders, such as businesses, trade associations and chambers, and unions."
care resources for students with special needs and mental health conditions in polytechnics,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Education (a) what are the care resources available to students with special needs and mental health conditions in the polytechnics; and (b) whether there is enough continuity in support for students with such needs and conditions going from secondary schools to the polytechnics.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: All polytechnics have a Special Educational Needs (SEN) Support Office. The office provides funding support for students to purchase the necessary Assistive Technology devices, such as motorised wheel chairs, and support services, such as note-taking services for students with Hearing Impairment. They also collaborate with Voluntary Welfare Organisations for internship placements and job matching for students, and conduct training for faculty and staff to raise awareness of SEN and build an inclusive campus culture. Polytechnics have put in place appropriate measures to support their students.  With parental consent, MOE passes on SEN-related information of secondary school graduands to the receiving polytechnic to facilitate their transition into a new learning environment. They will advise students with SEN and match them to courses that would be suitable for their learning needs. Some polytechnics also organise special orientation programmes for students with SEN. As for mental wellness, polytechnic students are older and may seek help differently from those in secondary schools. The polytechnics equip their students with basic knowledge of mental wellness through curricular and co-curricular programmes. Peer support programmes are also in place to equip student volunteers with active listening and other skills to identify distress signs in their peers. Para-counsellors, or academic staff who have undergone the necessary training, will provide the first-level of support to students. Students who require more help can turn to the professional counsellors in the polytechnics.  The polytechnics also partner external agencies like the Community Health Assessment Team which provides online counselling service. In addition, the Singapore Association of Mental Health also supports the polytechnics with referrals and case management. "
reducing probability of patients catching infection at hospital,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Health what is being done by our hospitals to reduce the probability of patients catching an infection at the hospital while being treated for other medical conditions.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Ministry of Health has been working with experts on the National Infection Prevention and Control Committee to improve infection control in hospitals. The National Infection Prevention and Control Guidelines for Acute Hospitals, published in August 2017, outlines the infection prevention and control programmes that all public and private hospitals are required to put in place. These programmes cover standard and transmission based precautions, active surveillance, outbreak response procedures, education of employees in infection prevention and monitoring of infection control practices. Our hospitals carry out audits regularly to assess infection control practices and address gaps, if any. MOH monitors the performance of all hospitals on standards developed by the National Infection Prevention and Control Committee. In April 2018, MOH completed the inaugural infection prevention and control peer review across all public hospitals. We also held a series of engagement sessions with the private hospitals to facilitate cross institutional exchange and learning. MOH has worked to strengthen key antimicrobial resistance control efforts through antimicrobial stewardship programs, and maintains surveillance of antimicrobial resistant organisms. While healthcare-associated Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) infections dropped from 0.84 per 10,000 patient days in 2013 to 0.38 in 2017, we cannot afford to be complacent. We need to continue to work with stakeholders, including doctors and healthcare providers, to strengthen antimicrobial stewardship. Finally, our hospitals have implemented measures to restrict the number of visitors to inpatients to reduce the risk of transmission of infections. We can also play our part by washing our hands before and after visiting our friends or relatives in the hospitals. "
additional buyer stamp duty remission for singles who have bought a second property and subsequently sold first property within six months,Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for Finance whether the Additional Buyer Stamp Duty remission can be extended to singles who have bought a second property and subsequently sold the first property within six months from their purchase of the second property.,"Mr Heng Swee Keat: The policy intent for ABSD is to moderate demand among homebuyers, and to ensure a stable and sustainable property market. This in turn will help both existing and aspiring homeowners, by keeping price increases in line with economic fundamentals. ABSD is applicable on the second and subsequent residential property purchases of all Singaporeans. This applies regardless of whether they dispose of their first property subsequently. This is because even if the first property is eventually disposed of, the purchase of the second property adds to the demand for residential properties. We have made one exception, namely for Singaporean married couples. A Singaporean married couple may need to change home due to changing family needs, such as when they have more children or when their children are growing up. It is in this context that we have an ABSD concession for Singaporean married couples buying a second property. Under the concession, we allow Singapore married couples to claim a refund of the ABSD paid on their second property, provided they sell their first property within six months after the purchase of a completed property, or the TOP date of an uncompleted property. This ABSD concession is not available to other groups of property buyers, as our overall key objective remains to moderate the demand for residential properties including that for second residential property of Singaporeans. Buyers who do not wish to incur the higher ABSD on second residential properties may wish to consider selling their first property before purchasing their replacement property. "
amount spent and subsidy given for supplements dispensed to pregnant patients at public hospitals and polyclinics,"Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked the Minister for Health with regard to the health supplements dispensed by our public hospitals and polyclinics such as folic acid and iron supplements for pregnant patients (a) in each of the last three years, what have been (i) the amounts spent by patients and (ii) the amounts of subsidy paid by the Government; and (b) how do our medical institutions ensure that these products meet the prescribed levels of supplement required by the patients.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Folic acid and iron supplements are necessary for many expectant mothers, and are subsidised under our Standard Drug List. Subsidised patients receive up to 75 percent subsidy for these supplements depending on their means.  In the last three years, the average amounts paid by subsidised patients for folic acid and iron supplements over the course of their pregnancy were $3 and $30 respectively. Overall, the total subsidies provided by the Government for the supplements were $11,300, $15,400 and $17,300 in 2015, 2016 and 2017 respectively.  Whilst a daily dose of 400 micrograms of folic acid is generally sufficient for low risk pregnancies, expectant mothers are typically prescribed five milligrams of folic acid per day. This is based on the recommended daily dose from preconception to the initial 12 weeks of pregnancy when there is higher risk of the foetus developing neural tube defects.  As for iron supplements, most doctors prescribe routine iron tablets as general supplement from 20 weeks of pregnancy onwards. However, doctors also check for anaemia in the first trimester and also after 28 weeks of pregnancy to determine if a higher dose of iron supplement is warranted. "
impact of bus services reliability framework’s adherence to time schedule requirement on driving behaviour,Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the Bus Services Reliability Framework (BSRF) which requires buses to adhere strictly to the time schedule has led to the behavior of buses captains deliberately slowing or stopping at bus stops when they are ahead of schedule to avoid incurring penalties; (b) whether the framework can be fine-tuned to improve commuters' experience and not unnecessarily prolonging the bus journeys; and (c) whether long-distance trunk services can be exempted from the BSRF.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: We have introduced the Bus Service Reliability Framework (BSRF) to improve the punctuality and reliability of bus services. Under the BSRF, bus captains adjust their travelling speeds to maintain consistent headways between buses, so as to minimise bus bunching and improve punctuality and reliability. While speeding up may benefit commuters on the bus, other commuters who arrive at the bus stops based on the scheduled timings will end up missing them and waiting much longer. Nevertheless, LTA works closely with the bus operators to periodically review the schedules, so as to better reflect traffic conditions. Long-distance bus services are more exposed to potential delays due to traffic conditions as well as passenger boarding and alighting activities. Hence, it is even more important that these routes remain under the BSRF to ensure service reliability for commuters. Moving forward, LTA will step up publicity efforts on the BSRF, so that the public can be made aware of the reasons for and benefits of the BSRF."
dealing with pigeon nuisance at hdb estates,Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for National Development what effective strategies have been developed to deal with pigeon nuisance at HDB estates.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The management of pigeon-related issues requires a multi-stakeholder approach. This includes government agencies such as AVA and NEA, Town Councils, and members of the public.Restricting the availability of food is one of the most effective ways to reduce pigeon populations. AVA issues advisories to inform residents about the environmental health and hygiene issues caused by feeding pigeons, and also takes enforcement action against pigeon feeders. In tandem, NEA ensures good food waste management in food centres and coffee shops in HDB estates, and enforces against littering offences. Finally, Town Councils maintain the cleanliness of estates. Where appropriate, they also deploy localised bird-deterrent measures such as spikes or nets on the external facades of buildings, to discourage pigeons from roosting. AVA will continue to test other solutions to manage the pigeon population. For example, AVA has conducted trials at selected locations to study the efficacy of contraceptives to manage the pigeon population. These trials saw some success, but also revealed that the use of contraceptives should still be coupled with other measures such as enforcement and education to ensure a sustained reduction in the pigeon population. AVA will continue to trial the contraceptives at other suitable locations to further assess the effectiveness of this solution. "
take-up rate for adoption leave,Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Social and Family Development what is the take-up rate for adoption leave after the legislative changes introduced in July 2017 that allows for adoptive mothers to get 12 weeks of adoption leave.,"Mr Desmond Lee: From 1 July to 31 December 2017, 67 mothers applied to adopt a child aged below 12 months. Twenty four have taken adoption leave. Not all of the adoptive mothers require adoption leave, as some may not be working. This number may still increase as adoptive mothers have the flexibility to take adoption leave till their adopted child turns 12 months old.  "
protecting rights of self-employed such as hawkers and private-hire drivers,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Manpower what measures are taken to protect the rights of the self-employed such as hawkers and private-hire drivers who are often required to provide minimum hours of work or fulfill other conditions of service when signing contracts for their trade; (b) under what conditions will such contracts give rise to an employment relationship under the Employment Act; and (c) whether the Ministry will provide guidance to the self-employed on structuring self-employment trade contracts to provide for their welfare and to avoid effecting an employment relationship.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: In general, self-employed persons (SEPs) choose who to contract with and can negotiate the terms of their service contracts. To better support SEPs, we launched the Tripartite Standard on Contracting with Self-Employed Persons in March this year. Companies that adopt the Standard commit to discussing and agreeing on the terms of engagement with SEPs prior to the purchase of any services, and to set these terms out in writing. Over time, the Standard will help shape contracting norms and entrench best practices. SEPs may also seek help from the NTUC, their affiliates such as the National Private Hire Vehicles Association, or other SEP associations in their respective sectors. Such groups can help to advance the interests of SEPs with the major service buyers. MOM considers a range of factors when assessing whether an individual is an employee or self-employed. There is no single test to conclusively distinguish a contract of employment from a contract for services. The ability to decide on the hours of work is one of the factors considered. Other factors include whether the worker must use the equipment and tools provided, comply with prescribed procedures, follow a fixed schedule, and carry out the work without getting a replacement etc. Each case has to be evaluated holistically. Any SEP, including hawkers and private-hire car drivers, who thinks that he or she has been wrongly classified should approach MOM so that an appropriate determination can be made.Our surveys show that the proportion of primary SEPs1 in the resident workforce has remained stable at between 8-10%. The vast majority of them prefer self-employment over regular employment because of the increased range of work choices that it affords, greater flexibility and autonomy, as well as an alternative source of income. However, for SEPs who prefer to be an employee, the Ministry and our tripartite partners are working to improve their awareness of job matching schemes. Career centres run by Workforce Singapore and NTUC's Employment and Employability Institute can also offer job facilitation services."
singaporeans enrolled in courses related to esports,"Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) in the past year, how many Singaporeans have enrolled in courses related to eSports; (b) what are the career prospects for those in the eSports industry; and (c) what is the Ministry doing to expand professional opportunities for youths who are interested in the eSports industry.","Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: The Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY) has been closely monitoring the rising popularity of esports among our youth.  In August this year, the Ministry organised the inaugural ASEAN youth esports tournament, Hyperplay, to bring together youth of different backgrounds who share a common passion, as well as to promote greater understanding of ASEAN and build friendships across borders.Sport Singapore (SportSG) has been supportive of the esports fraternity's efforts to establish a National Sport Association (NSA). As with other sports, the NSA is expected to develop the sport’s ecosystem. This includes developing athletes, coaches, officials and administrators for the sport. The NSA will also oversee the development of athletes to represent Singapore, should esports competitions be introduced in future Major Games. We see that there is private sector interest to develop esports in the region, and this could provide more business and career opportunities for Singaporeans. For example, Razer and Sea (formerly known as Garena) are Singapore-based companies that are active in this space, both in Singapore and the region. Singtel also recently organised the PvP esports Championship in October.  There will be Singaporeans who will want to explore opportunities in this growing industry. Our polytechnics and universities offer programmes in design and media, such as in digital animation and game design. In particular, one of the local esports interest groups, the Singapore Cybersports & Online Gaming Association (SCOGA), has been working with Republic Polytechnic to incorporate esports content as part of the school’s Diploma in Sport Management.  We will continue to monitor the development of esports, as another area which our youth can express their passions and achieve their potential."
children below age 18 who are diagnosed with obesity-related illnesses,Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for Health (a) how many children below 18 years of age are currently diagnosed with obesity-related illnesses; (b) whether there are adequate medical resources to cater to their healthcare needs; and (c) what is being done to prevent and reduce obesity among children.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Obesity is a risk factor for developing medical conditions such as high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Childhood obesity often persists into adulthood, when it can cause adverse health effects. Overweight children at the upper end of the cohort weight range are at higher risk of developing such medical conditions earlier. About 13% of our children aged 6-18 are overweight. Among the higher risk overweight1 students screened at the Health Promotion Board's Student Health Centre (HPB SHC) in 2016, less than 2% had impaired fasting blood glucose, and about one in three had elevated blood pressure or elevated blood lipids.To strengthen intervention early through lifestyle management, higher risk overweight children are referred by schools to the HPB SHC for assessment and lifestyle coaching. Those found to have an obesity-related medical condition are referred for specialist care at public sector hospitals.  HPB works with schools to increase opportunities for physical activity and make healthier meals more accessible for students. Student Health Advisors are also deployed to secondary schools to provide counselling to help overweight students change unhealthy behaviors. To make healthy living a norm, NurtureSG also published a mini-booklet on ""5 Habit Hacks for a Healthier Child"" to educate and empower parents with the skills to improve their child's health. MOH and HPB will continue our efforts to foster healthy behaviours in our young to improve their physical well-being. "
additional cpf housing grant and special cpf housing grant for first-time buyers of hdb flats in matured estates,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry asked the Minister for National Development whether the Additional CPF Housing Grant and Special CPF Housing Grant can be extended to first-time buyers of HDB flats in matured estates as these buyers may wish to live near to their parents within the 4km radius.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB is committed to providing affordable public housing for Singaporeans. Helping families live with or near each other for mutual care and support has also been a longstanding priority for the Government.  To ensure new flats are affordable for first-timer families, we provide the Additional CPF Housing Grant (AHG) and Special CPF Housing Grant (SHG), on top of subsidised flat prices. All first-timer families earning up to $5,000 a month can receive an AHG of up to $40,000, regardless of whether they are buying a new flat in a mature or non-mature estate. The SHG of up to $40,000 is also extended to eligible first-timer families when they purchase 4-room and smaller flats in non-mature estates, to encourage prudence in home purchases. For those buying new flats in HDB’s Build-To-Order and Sale of Balance Flats exercises, we have various schemes that give priority to families who wish to stay with or near each other: the Married Child Priority Scheme, Multi-Generation Priority Scheme and Senior Priority Scheme. For multi-generation families that wish to stay together, we have also introduced purpose-built Three-Generation (3Gen) flats for a more comfortable living environment. First-timer families buying resale flats are also given significant government support. They can enjoy housing grants of up to $120,000, comprising a CPF Housing Grant of up to $50,000, an AHG of up to $40,000 and a Proximity Housing Grant of up to $30,000. This is regardless of whether the resale flat is in a mature or non-mature estate.  We will continue to review our housing policies to ensure that public housing remains affordable."
revenue generated by contracts that referred foreign patients to public hospitals,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Health (a) how many patients and how much revenue did the referral contracts for foreign patients bring in for the public hospitals during the life of this practice; and (b) whether this had compromised Singaporeans' priority access to public healthcare resources.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The priority of the Ministry of Health (MOH) and public healthcare institutions (PHIs) is to serve Singaporeans' healthcare needs. Our PHIs are not allowed to actively market themselves to foreign patients. MOH has also recently asked PHIs to cease any contracts with service providers to assist foreign patients referred for medical treatment in Singapore. Today, none of our PHIs have contracts with such service providers anymore.There are foreign patients who travel to Singapore to seek medical treatment on their own accord. Between 2013 and 2017, such patients make up about 1.5% of the total inpatient and day surgery attendances at our PHIs. Those whose referrals were supported by contracted service providers constituted about 0.4% of attendances in PHIs that had such contracts. Revenue from such patients made up 0.8% of total revenue in these PHIs. Singaporeans remained the majority of patients treated in PHIs. Foreign patients have not impacted our PHI's delivery of services and subsidised appointment slots given to Singaporeans. In fact, the median waiting time for new subsidised specialist appointments has improved steadily from 28 days in 2013 to 22 days in the first half of 2018. MOH will continue to work with our PHIs to ensure that meeting Singaporean's healthcare needs remains our priority."
causes of double-digit growth in healthcare inflation over last decade,"Mr Seah Kian Peng asked the Minister for Health what are the causes of healthcare inflation which has seen double digit growth over the past 10 years, far outstripping normal inflation.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: National Health Expenditure, or NHE, is commonly used to track healthcare spending. Between 2006 to 2016, our NHE increased at an average rate of 11% per year. In addition to healthcare inflation, the increased expenditure includes several factors, such as our ageing population, higher utilisation of healthcare services and capital expenditure on the building of more public healthcare facilities in recent years. The NHE figure for 2017 is not yet available.  Over the same period, the Government has provided more support for healthcare. These include the Pioneer Generation Package, MediShield Life premium subsidies and the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS). Between 2006 to 2016, the Government’s expenditure on healthcare increased significantly faster by 17% and consequently, the Government’s share of NHE increased from about 30% to more than 40%.As a result of increased government subsidies, while the growth in our NHE has been high, healthcare inflation, defined as the growth in prices of healthcare goods and services borne by Singaporeans, has been lower. Between 2007 and 2017, Singapore’s average annual healthcare inflation was 2.6% compared to 2.3% for all goods and services.  We will continue to monitor healthcare inflation closely and keep healthcare affordable for all Singaporeans. "
complaints of noise generated by pump and lift fixtures due to design issues of hdb flats,"Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for National Development in the past 10 years, what has been the number of feedback received from residents each year with regard to noise generated by pump and lift fixtures due to design issues of HDB flats.","Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB blocks are designed to insulate individual flats from noise generated by mechanical services such as pumps and lifts. For example, in situations where the lift shaft is next to the living room or bedroom of a flat, HDB provides a cavity wall buffer, or a wall with an air gap in between.  As mechanical services are managed and maintained by Town Councils, residents who provide feedback on noise from these systems typically approach the Town Councils directly, and not HDB. The Town Councils will then work with the maintenance contractors of the systems to address the feedback.  For cases where HDB is made aware of the feedback either through the Town Council or from the resident directly, HDB will work with the relevant Town Council to implement measures to mitigate the noise, where necessary.  "
public education on possible safety issues for water heaters connected by three-pin plugs,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for National Development what educational or other measures will be taken by HDB to address possible safety issues in relation to water heaters connected by three-pin plugs.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Water heaters should be connected to a 20 ampere socket switch instead of a normal 3-pin socket, which can only support currents of 13 amperes. The installation of water heaters must be done by an electrical worker licensed by the Energy Market Authority (EMA).The Government will do its part to educate residents on the proper installation of water heaters. Currently, HDB's Home Improvement Programme (HIP) contractors who find water heaters incorrectly installed during the course of their work will advise the residents to address the issue. HDB will also work with EMA on a public awareness campaign to remind all residents of the importance of the safe installation of water heaters."
proportion of hdb rental flats allocated to singaporeans who have owned hdb flats previously,Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for National Development (a) how many and what proportion of HDB rental flats under the Public Rental Scheme are currently allocated to Singaporeans who have owned HDB flats previously; and (b) how does prior home ownership affect the priority of allocation of HDB rental flats compared with applicants who have not previously owned HDB flats.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: About 24,000, or close to half of all public rental households, have previously owned HDB flats. Entry into public rental is on a needs-basis. Rental applicants are assessed based on factors such as household income, whether they have family support, and their ability to afford other housing options. For applicants who have previously owned a property, the proceeds from the sale of their last property will be taken into account when assessing their housing budget. "
reviews and changes made to saf training doctrines given recent deaths,"Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry asked the Minister for Defence in the wake of the recent SAF training accidents, whether there will be an SAF-wide review on training doctrines that will factor in the learning from the various incidents.","26 Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Defence in light of the recent fatal accident involving a national serviceman (a) how many serious vehicular incidents have there been over the past three years; (b) what have been the safety enhancements since the Shoalwater Bay Training Area incident in September 2017; and (c) what are the Ministry's proposed plans since this latest incident.27 Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Defence regarding the death of a national serviceman during training on 3 November 2018 (a) what was the cause of his death; (b) what is the status of the investigations; and (c) how can processes be improved to reduce the probability of something similar happening in the future.Dr Ng Eng Hen: The Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) and the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) offer our deepest condolences to the family of the late Corporal First Class (CFC) Liu Kai. CFC Liu was a dedicated soldier who served with honour and was well-respected by his peers. His passing is a loss to the SAF and our nation. Parallel and independent processes to investigate the cause of the training death of CFC Liu are on-going. They include Police investigations, wherein the Coroner may decide to hold a public Inquiry. The Armed Forces Council has convened a Committee of Inquiry (COI) whose members all work outside MINDEF/SAF. They comprise the chairperson, a civil servant from another Ministry; a consultant medical specialist; a member from the External Review Panel on SAF Safety (ERPSS); a senior-ranked National Serviceman and a member of the Workplace Safety and Health Council. The COI has started work. The COI has full access to material and witnesses to determine the facts and will make specific recommendations to rectify any systemic or human lapses found. The ERPSS will also provide a written report on the COI findings, which will be made public. Without prejudicing these official investigations, I will provide some preliminary findings in response to Members’ questions. On the morning of 3 November, CFC Liu was driving the Land Rover carrying a trainer that was involved in an Armour exercise at the Jalan Murai training area. The Land Rover was stationary behind a Bionix Armoured Fighting Vehicle which was part of the exercise. The Bionix responded to a simulated enemy encounter to reverse away from simulated enemy fire. The Bionix reversed into the Land Rover and partially mounted the Land Rover. The trainer was unhurt but CFC Liu sustained injuries. Training was immediately halted and the on-site medic attended to CFC Liu. The SAF Emergency Ambulance Service, unit medical officer, and Singapore Civil Defence Force were activated and arrived soon after to attend to CFC Liu. Unfortunately, CFC Liu succumbed to his injuries and passed away. There are obviously a number of questions that need to be answered in determining the cause of this incident. They include: Were safety protocols followed by the crew of the Land Rover and the Bionix vehicle during this phase of the exercise? Were the vehicle commander, driver and crew of the Bionix aware of the Land Rover behind them and did they conduct their reversal safely? What was the physical state of exercise participants and did it have an effect on their attention to safety protocols? Was there any mechanical malfunction of vehicles or platforms? Did Safety Officers and Vehicle Commanders perform their responsibilities? The COI and Police investigations will fully examine these and other related questions into the death of CFC Liu. When all the facts have been gathered, my Minister will give Parliament a full account, as we have done previously in this House.Following CFC Liu’s incident, a safety timeout was effected for both local and overseas training by the Army to review our safety systems and ensure that our servicemen can continue to train safely. This included a review of our training doctrines and safety processes, that Members of Parliament (MPs) asked about. Particular attention was paid to the safety management plans for high-risk activities such as live-firing and training which require the use of vehicles and military platforms. Vehicle operators and crew conducted a series of drills to refresh their training, and ensure that they were well-prepared to carry out their assigned tasks. Unit commanders reinforced the importance of safety in training to their soldiers and emphasised the responsibility of every commander and soldier in ensuring not just their own safety, but also of their buddies and those around them. The safety timeout was lifted on 8 November and training has resumed progressively.SMS Heng visited Exercise Trident in Shoalwater Bay, Australia. The troops had been conducting safety rehearsals to refresh their drills before the exercise. During the exercise, the sea was choppy, and affected plans for the conduct of ship-to-shore operations, which was a key highlight of this year’s bilateral exercise with the Australian Defence Force. The safety of our soldiers is of utmost importance to the SAF. The unit adjusted their plans and transferred the forces from ship to shore by helicopter.  We can train effectively and safely. Member Mr Desmond Choo had asked about the number of serious vehicular incidents in the last three years. Apart from this November’s incident, there was one other training-related vehicular incident that resulted in death, in the last three years. That involved the late Third Sergeant (3SG) Gavin Chan in September 2017. Apart from these two cases, there were no other combat vehicular incidents which resulted in serious injury.MPs Mr Henry Kwek and Mr Christopher de Souza have also asked how MINDEF and the SAF can learn from past incidents to prevent further injuries and deaths. Over the past three years, the Army has been deploying more Regulars to supervise and conduct the training of our full-time National Servicemen. The Army is now reviewing the experience level and roles of supervising, conducting and safety officers to further strengthen training and safety outcomes. MINDEF and the SAF will also undertake further reviews to curtail human lapses and mitigate risks associated with training. The SAF is also convening an External Review Panel on Combat Vehicle Safety. This panel will comprise experts outside of the SAF, to have a thorough review of current policies and measures surrounding combat vehicle training safety.The SAF will continue to find ways to enhance our safety systems and ensure that the processes in place remain sound and robust. The SAF will continue in its efforts to instil a strong safety culture to achieve zero training fatalities – which can only be achieved if every soldier has an ingrained concern for the well-being of himself and his fellow soldiers. This will be emphasised to every commander and soldier.  MINDEF and the SAF await the conclusion and recommendations of the investigative processes for the death of CFC Liu and will implement the necessary changes thereafter. We will do all we can to help support the late CFC Liu’s family through this difficult period. "
"inclusion of private security officers, cleaners and waste collectors as “public servants” under protection from harassment act","Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether all private security officers working in public places can be treated as ""public service workers"" under the Protection from Harassment Act instead of limiting protection under the Act to only those working in specified places such as public healthcare institutions, educational institutions, bus interchanges and railway premises.","31 Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether cleaners and waste collectors can be treated as ""public service workers"" under the Protection from  Harassment Act; and (b) whether such a class of workers can be expanded to cover all cleaners and waste collectors working in places to which the public has access, as such individuals are performing services which are essential to the well-being of the public or the proper functioning of Singapore and are vulnerable to harassment and abuse in the course of their work.Mr K Shanmugam: The Member asked if we could classify all private security guards, as well as all cleaners and waste collectors, as Public Service Workers. In general, we consider individuals as Public Service Workers for the purpose of additional protection under the Protection from Harassment Act (POHA) if their jobs serve the general public, and not just patrons of a private business or establishment. For example, cleaners in public hospitals and security guards at bus interchanges would be considered as Public Service Workers. On the other hand, cleaners in private hospitals and security guards in commercial buildings would not be considered as Public Service Workers.Notwithstanding this, there are sufficient protections under POHA for everyone. Offenders convicted under POHA for harassment can be punished with a fine of up to $5,000, or an imprisonment term of up to twelve months, or both, if the victim is a Public Service Worker or public servant. If the victim is any other member of the public, the punishment is a fine of up to $5,000, or an imprisonment term of up to six months, or both."
policies and guidelines for handling sensitive health data of patients in public and private sectors,"Prof Fatimah Lateef asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the Ministry has overarching policies, guidelines and oversight for handling sensitive health data and records of patients in both the public and private healthcare sectors; and (b) if so, whether there are audits and checks scheduled and conducted that are over and above that which individual institutions may have.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Healthcare entities in the public and private sectors are licensed under the Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act. They are required to have in place adequate safeguards to maintain and protect their medical records against loss, or unauthorised modification, destruction, access, disclosure, copying or use. They are also subject to requirements under the Personal Data Protection Act, which imposes obligations to protect personal data.  For selected clinical conditions, additional safeguards are required due to the sensitivity of such conditions. Some are protected by legislations such as the Termination of Pregnancy Act and the Human Organ Transplant Act. Other sensitive medical conditions are subject to additional technical controls to restrict access to records, in line with the Advisory Guidelines issued by the Personal Data Protection Commission for the Healthcare Sector in 2014. MOH regularly inspects and audits healthcare institutions for compliance, to ensure that licensees have taken reasonable actions to implement appropriate and adequate safeguards for the integrity and confidentiality of patients’ medical records. If licensees are found to be non-compliant, they may be subject to penalties under the relevant Acts."
prevalence and awareness of vitamin d deficiency,Mr Yee Chia Hsing asked the Minister for Health what is the estimated percentage of the population that is deemed deficient in Vitamin D and whether there are measures to increase awareness of the risks associated with Vitamin D deficiency.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Vitamin D promotes the absorption of calcium by the body, which in turn keeps our bones strong and healthy. Most people obtain Vitamin D from skin exposure to sunlight, supplemented with dietary sources. A lack of Vitamin D may put a person at higher risk of conditions such as osteoporosis. Other effects still being studied include the impact on immune function.According to the National Health Survey in 2010, 40% and 8% respectively of Singaporeans were deficient and very deficient for Vitamin D. However, not all people with Vitamin D deficiency would experience an impact on their health. Our survey findings are also comparable to other countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, and South Korea. To ensure adequate levels of Vitamin D and proper absorption of calcium by the body, the Health Promotion Board (HPB) recommends a diet containing foods rich in Vitamin D, such as eggs and oily fish, and at least five to 30 minutes of sun exposure at least twice a week. To promote adequate nutrition, HPB rolled out ""The Recipe for Healthy Ageing"", a toolkit designed to raise awareness on nutritional requirements for seniors aged 50 and above, and guide them on food sources that would meet their dietary needs. "
legal aid applications by family members of mentally disabled for appointment as deputies,"Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Law with regard to the expanded means test applicable to mentally disabled persons who are unable to work, whether the Ministry can treat legal aid applications by family members of the mentally disabled persons for appointment as deputies to manage their personal affairs as applications being made for and on behalf of the mentally disabled (instead of the individual family members) thereby entitling the legal aid applications to be assessed on the expanded means test.","Mr K Shanmugam: A legal aid application for deputyship has to be made in the name of the family member seeking to be made a deputy, as deputyship proceedings in the Courts are commenced in the family member’s name. The application for legal aid should thus be assessed on the means of the applicant for deputyship. It is not possible for legal aid applications to be made for, or on behalf of, the mentally incapacitated person, and then to use that person’s means to support the legal aid application. Legal aid is provided to low-income Singaporeans who cannot afford their own lawyers. To qualify for legal aid, the family member has to pass the means test. For the past 3 years, about 85% of legal aid applications for deputyship matters passed the preliminary means test.  We should add that the Ministry of Law intends to restructure the legal aid means test. This is intended to be achieved by the Legal Aid and Advice (Amendment) Bill which has been introduced. Instead of the applicant’s disposable income, we will be seeking to use Per Capita Household Income (PCHI) to assess means. PCHI takes into account both the income of the applicant applying for deputyship and the income of the mentally incapacitated patient, if they live in the same household. We will also provide greater flexibility to provide targeted help to applicants with extenuating circumstances. Finally, Singaporeans may wish to plan ahead and make a Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA). One key advantage of an LPA is that an individual, who has the requisite mental capacity, is able to choose his proxy decision maker, and discuss the LPA with his family so that his wishes are made known in advance. Crucially, if there is an existing LPA, family members of that individual also need not apply to the Courts to be appointed as deputies to make certain decisions on behalf of the individual if he lacks mental capacity, thereby saving expenses and time. The fee waiver for Singaporeans making an LPA has been extended to 31 August 2020, to encourage more Singaporeans to make an LPA."
dependants of hdb flat owners who have benefited from home protection scheme,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Manpower (a) in the past three years, how many dependants of HDB flat owners have benefitted from the Home Protection Scheme (HPS) upon the death of the owner; (b) what has been the number of unsuccessful claims and what are the reasons; and (c) how many dependants have made appeals for HPS claims.","Mrs Josephine Teo: From 2015 to 2017, the Home Protection Scheme (HPS) has helped to pay the remaining mortgage for about 1,800 HDB lessees who died. Another 70 unsuccessful death claims were made. Out of these, 22 dependants submitted an appeal, of which one was approved. The treatment of claims for HPS is in line with industry practice. Unsuccessful death claims remain a small minority and fall into three categories. First, serious pre-existing illness was undeclared when the HPS was purchased, and such declaration would have resulted in the HPS not having been extended in the first place. Second, the HPS cover had lapsed and was no longer in force when the policy owner died. This arises mainly because premiums remained unpaid despite repeated reminders from CPF Board. Third, the policy holder committed suicide within the first year of HPS cover. In cases where the HPS claim are not successful, dependants can explore other options with HDB. They can seek HDB’s assistance to reduce or defer mortgage payments until the family regains financial stability. HDB can also assist the family to right-size to a more affordable flat if they choose to do so."
licensing system for ownership of cats to prevent cat abandonment,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry will start a licensing system for the ownership of cats to prevent cat abandonment.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Pet licensing primarily serves to protect public health. As dogs are the most common cause of rabies transmission from animals to humans globally, AVA requires them to be licensed to enable traceability for the purposes of disease control.AVA has put in place several measures to deter pet abandonment. First, AVA conducts public education initiatives to promote responsible pet ownership, including school talks and community events. Second, AVA requires pet shops to do pre-sales screenings to assess and ensure that their customers are suitable pet owners. Finally, owners who are found to have abandoned their pets may be liable to a maximum fine of $10,000 and a jail term of up to 12 months, for first-time convictions. AVA investigates all feedback on alleged pet abandonment and will take enforcement action where required.AVA will continue to work with stakeholders to review measures to promote responsible pet ownership and deter pet abandonment."
elderly parents rendered homeless after being chased out of adult children’s flats bought with proceeds from elderly parents’ flats,"Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar asked the Minister for National Development in the last five years, how many cases have been brought to HDB's attention of elderly parents who have been rendered homeless after their adult children chased them out of their flats even though the flats owned by these adult children have been bought initially with the proceeds from the elderly parents' sale of their own flats.","Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB does not have data on the number of elderly who sold their flats, used the proceeds to help their adult children buy another flat, but were eventually chased out and rendered homeless.  Elderly parents whose children are not willing to support them may seek the assistance of Family Service Centres or the Office of the Commissioner for the Maintenance of Parents. If mediation is not successful, they can consider making an application for maintenance at the Tribunal for the Maintenance of Parents.  For elderly parents who are unable to obtain support from their children, HDB looks into their individual circumstances and will allocate a rental flat to those who have no other housing option. "
expedite upgrading works in common areas of private estates under estate upgrading programme,"Mr Chong Kee Hiong asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry can expedite and extend the upgrading works in the common areas of private estates under the Estate Upgrading Programme especially in estates above 30 years old, with priority given to older estates.","Mr Lawrence Wong: For the Estate Upgrading Programme (EUP), we do prioritise older estates, especially those with greater need and scope for significant improvement.We are currently coordinating with other agencies that are planning upgrading works, to minimise inconvenience to residents. We will contact the Citizens’ Consultative Committees to seek nominations for the next batch of EUP estates soon. "
improving level of sound-proofing of hdb bto flats,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether the level of sound-proofing in our HDB BTO flats has declined in recent years with the use of non-concrete walls and with the more recent flat or building designs; and (b) whether the Ministry has any plans to improve the level of sound-proofing in new BTO flats.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB buildings are constructed using reinforced concrete in accordance with the prevailing building codes and industry norms. This ensures that our buildings are structurally safe and suitable for occupancy. While the design of HDB flats have undergone some changes and improvements over the years, such changes in design do not reduce the level of sound-proofing in the flats.As part of efforts to improve overall construction productivity, since November 2014, BCA has required all residential non-landed developments to use non-concrete drywalls for internal partitions, except for wet areas such as the bathroom and kitchen areas. The drywall systems used in BTO developments, which comprise a metal framework enclosed with gypsum plaster panels on both sides and filled with sound insulation material, provide comparable acoustic insulation as concrete walls of similar thickness. To elaborate, the Sound Transmission Class (STC) is used to rate the acoustic performance of interior partitions. It is the decibel reduction in noise a partition can provide, with a higher STC value given for better acoustic performance. Interior walls using bricks or concrete have STC of about 40, which is considered suitable for residential units. The drywall systems used in new BTO developments since 2014 have a STC of at least 45, which is even higher.Notwithstanding the flat design or the material used, in a high-density living environment like a HDB block, it is also important that residents do their part by being considerate, such as through keeping the noise level down especially late at night, so as to provide a pleasant living environment for all."
expected time frame for lta to complete review with stakeholders on safety requirements for personal mobility devices (pmds),Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the expected timeframe for LTA to complete its review with stakeholders on safety requirements for personal mobility devices (PMDs) to mitigate fire risks; (b) whether the Ministry will impose a ban on PMDs and components that come from non-reputable sources in the interim; and (c) whether maintenance standards for PMDs can be made part of the Safe Riding Programme.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: LTA has studied the standards available today and determined that the UL 2272 standard is suitable for application for motorised personal mobility devices (PMDs) in Singapore. To improve the safety of motorised PMDs and reduce fire risks, we will require all motorised PMDs intended for use on public paths to conform to the UL 2272 standard. We will prohibit retailers from selling motorised PMDs which are not UL 2272 compliant from July 2019 onwards. This provides retailers with a nine-month transition period to change their inventories and comply with the new regulation. Existing owners of motorised PMDs which are not UL 2272 compliant can continue to use their devices until December 2020. They will thus have a grace period of over two years to make the transition to a UL 2272 certified PMD. This takes into account the average PMD lifespan of below three years. Motorised PMDs which are not UL 2272 compliant will be prohibited from use on public paths from January 2021 onwards. Meanwhile, we strongly encourage owners of motorised PMDs to switch to UL 2272 compliant devices in order to minimise the fire risk of their devices. When purchasing PMDs, consumers should seek out reputable sources and study their fire safety standards. They should not overcharge batteries, modify their PMDs or tamper with the electrical components of their PMDs. We will include such advisory information in the Safe Riding Programme curriculum."
restriction on claims for compensation for damage to building during construction to structural damage,"Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry intends to maintain the current restriction of claiming compensation for damage to any building arising from the construction or operation of the railway or road tunnel to just structural damage and loss due to displacement resulting from structural damage and, if so, why.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: LTA works closely with its contractors to minimise the impact of rail and road works on buildings. For example, prior to the commencement of construction activities, LTA undertakes engineering studies and site investigation works to ascertain the effects of the construction activities on the surrounding areas, and pre-emptively carries out any necessary engineering protection works.If damage is caused by LTA’s construction activities, LTA and its contractors will, as a general rule, try to rectify the damage and the issue of compensation therefore does not arise.Should there be a need for compensation, the Land Transport Authority of Singapore Act (LTA Act) lays out a framework for different types of compensation claims. The compensation framework is not limited to the types of claims mentioned by the Member. For example, in cases where LTA exercises its powers to enter private land to construct railways or public roads, compensation may also be claimed by owners of buildings which suffer damage, including non-structural damage, or building owners who are displaced.  In all cases, LTA will evaluate based on the circumstances and handle each case in consultation with the stakeholders."
sale of 2-room flexi flats or studio flats of shorter leases on open market,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development (a) to date, how many 2-room flexi flats or studio flats of shorter lease have been sold in the resale market and what are the reasons for the sale; and (b) whether buyers who bought such 2-room flats can buy an additional lease to top up the balance of the lease.","Mr Lawrence Wong: 2-room Flexi short-lease flats, and the earlier Studio Apartments (SA), are designed specifically for seniors to live out their retirement years. Before their purchase, seniors are made aware that these flats cannot be sold in the resale market. If they no longer need their flat, seniors can return the flat to HDB and receive a refund of the value of the unused portion of the lease.   Under the 2-room Flexi Scheme, seniors can buy a 2-room Flexi flat on a shorter lease of 15 to 45 years, as long as the lease can cover them and their spouse up to at least age 95. For example, a couple aged 60 have to buy a flat with a lease of at least 35 years. If they prefer a longer lease, they could have a lease of 45 years, to last till them age 105. Providing this option to seniors upfront mitigates the need for subsequent lease top-up. Seniors who own Studio Apartments, which were sold on fixed leases of 30 years, can apply to top up their lease by 5, 10 or 15 years at prevailing market value, at any point in time."
remaining number of obike bicycles left abandoned in public spaces,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the number of remaining oBike bicycles left abandoned in public spaces particularly in the private estates; (b) how does the LTA plan to remove these bicycles; and (c) when will these bicycles be completely removed from our public spaces.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Since oBike's exit on 25 June 2018, its liquidator, FTI Consulting, and the Land Transport Authority (LTA) have removed over 60,000 oBike bicycles. This has not been easy as the oBike bicycles do not have GPS transmitters to indicate their locations. Apart from systematic sweeps of residential areas, major roads and public transport nodes, many were found based on public feedback and reports by agencies. We thank Singaporeans for their feedback.We estimate that there are less than a thousand oBike bicycles left in public spaces. Many of these are likely in less accessible areas within industrial estates or parks. LTA is working closely with FTI Consulting to remove the remaining bicycles by end of this month. Meanwhile, members of the public who come across oBike bicycles are welcome to report their locations to FTI Consulting via obikelocated@fticonsulting.com, or LTA."
singles who have applied successfully to secure hdb bto flats,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development in the past three years (a) how many singles have applied successfully to secure HDB's BTO flats; and (b) what has been the ratio of successful applications between singles, senior citizens and low-income families for 2-rooms flexi flats since they were launched.","Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB introduced the 2-room Flexi Scheme in November 2015. At least 40% of 2-room Flexi BTO flats in non-mature estates are set aside for elderly aged 55 and above. The balance of up to 60% of the flat supply are divided equally between families and singles. Any quota not taken up by the elderly or families is allocated to singles. From 2015 to 2017, the proportion of applicants who were invited to book a 2-room Flexi flat increased from 52% to 84%. During this period, elderly, families and non-elderly singles made up about 33%, 7% and 60% respectively of those invited to book flats. Specifically, from November 2015 when the 2-room Flexi flats were introduced to end-2017, more than 5,500 non-elderly singles booked a BTO 2-room Flexi flat."
schedule for implementing extension of home improvement programme,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for National Development whether he can clarify on the timetable for implementing the Home Improvement Programme extension for the HDB estates that are now eligible.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: There are still around 80,000 flats built up to 1986 that are awaiting HIP. We have been ramping up the pace of HIP to complete these projects, and hope to complete the upgrading for these blocks by around 2021.  Once we have completed this batch of HIP, we plan to start on HIP for the blocks built between 1987 and 1997, which will cover about 230,000 flats. The exact timetable for implementing HIP for the newly eligible flats will be contingent on the Government’s fiscal position and budget availability."
high shelters spanning across public roads,"Mr Ang Wei Neng asked the Minister for Transport (a) to date, what is the number of high shelters built on public roads and which span across roads with two lanes each way; (b) what is the average construction cost of such high shelters; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider building more of such high shelters across the island.",Mr Khaw Boon Wan: I thank the Member for his questions. I have addressed them in my written reply at the 1 October 2018 Parliament sitting.
requirement for pre-payments collected by businesses in sale of goods and services to be deposited into escrow account,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether the Ministry will introduce a law to require all pre-payments collected by businesses in the sales of goods and services to be deposited into an escrow account that is free from encumbrances and creditors' claims and which account is strictly for use by the affected consumers for goods and services that have yet to be rendered or consumed.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: Today, it is not unusual for businesses to collect monies from consumers before they provide their goods and services to consumers. Consumers bear the risk of not being able to recover their monies in the event that a business suddenly ceases operations. This has resulted in public concerns on how companies should handle the monies they receive from consumers and the member’s suggestion to require all businesses to deposit advance monies collected from consumers in an escrow account. Let me first set out a few broad scenarios under which businesses may collect monies from consumers before they provide their goods and services to consumers. These are not exhaustive.  First, a business which is acting as an agent for its clients may need to hold monies in trust for its clients. We have rules that specify how such agents should handle monies that are held in trust. An example of this is for conveyancing transactions. Under the law, lawyers are not permitted to receive and hold conveyancing monies unless such monies are deposited in special conveyancing accounts opened with appointed banks, the Singapore Academy of Law or in an escrow account. Second, businesses may, as part of their loyalty programs and promotions, come up with their own stored value facilities and offer consumers a better deal when they purchase using these facilities. For example, a business may give consumers a discount off their purchases if they choose to pay using their stored value cards. There are also businesses which offer stored value facilities for payment of goods and services offered by various merchants. These are commonly known as multi-purpose stored value facilities. Third, businesses may also decide to offer consumers a variety of payment options for their services, such as prepaid packages and coupons. Businesses usually offer a lower unit price for these options. For example, an operator may charge consumers $100 for each session of their service but may offer consumers a better price of $90 per session if they choose to prepay for 10 sessions.   Fourth, businesses may also require consumers to make full or partial payment before they deliver the goods and services to consumers in full. Businesses may do this to ensure that the consumers are committed to the purchase before they put in time and resources to engage their own suppliers.  Fifth, businesses may also collect security deposits from consumers. The purpose of collecting such deposits is usually to cover the cost to businesses in the event of consumers' damage of rented goods or consumer default in payment for post-paid services.  As illustrated, there are many different scenarios under which businesses may collect monies from consumers before they provide their goods and services. Different scenarios carry different risks and require different controls to manage those risks. A mandatory requirement for businesses to ringfence all prepayments in an escrow account would stifle growth and innovation of legitimate businesses and affect the operations of small and medium enterprises, in particular. Broad-based regulatory measures would inevitably raise the cost of doing business which would be passed on to consumers. In some cases, this may even undermine the commercial viability of an industry. Instead of imposing broad-based regulatory measures, the Government has taken the approach of assessing the need and scope for specific regulatory measures for each sector. For instance, the Committee for Private Education (CPE) has imposed requirements on private education institutions to protect students’ course fees through fee collection caps and insurance schemes. The Singapore Tourism Board (STB) requires travel agents to offer consumers the option to purchase travel insurance that includes protection of their prepayments in the event of the travel agent’s insolvency. The Monetary Authority of Singapore has oversight of stored value facilities under the Payment Systems (Oversight) Act. The Act requires large multi-purpose stored value facilities holders that hold stored value exceeding S$30 million to seek approval from the Monetary Authority of Singapore to operate and appoint a bank to guarantee the outstanding stored value. Besides regulatory measures, the industry also plays a role in uplifting standards. The Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) has worked with industry associations to develop CaseTrust accreditation schemes for specific industries. A number of these schemes, including those for spa & wellness, renovation, motor vehicles and school bus services have prepayment protection requirements. We encourage consumers to patronise CaseTrust accredited businesses.  Consumers can also manage potential risks by making informed decisions. In this regard, CASE has issued several consumer tips on prepayment protection to help consumers. There are some questions that consumers can ask a business before committing to a prepayment. For example, ""Can I choose to pay for the cost of goods or services in parts over a period of time rather than pay for the full cost upfront?""; ""What is your refund policy?""; and ""Does your business provide any protection on consumer prepayments?"". By asking such questions and also comparing what different businesses offer, consumers will be empowered to make informed decisions. In conclusion, we need to strike a balance between safeguarding consumers and enabling business innovation and growth. The risks and controls would be different for different scenarios and while the Government has put in place regulatory measures to safeguard consumers' interests, the industry and consumers also have a role to play. The Government will continue to monitor developments and consider additional sector-specific prepayment protection requirements as necessary, taking into consideration the cost impact on businesses and consumers."
measures to prevent elderly suicide and isolation,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Health whether any new and additional measures will be taken to (i) address the increase in elderly suicides and (ii) prevent or minimise elderly isolation.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: While the number of elderly suicides has increased in recent years along with our ageing population, the suicide death rates among our elderly have in fact declined over the past decade. The suicide rate among Singapore residents aged 60 years and above fell from 22.4 per 100,000 residents in 2007 to 16.4 in 2017. However, each suicide is one too many. Government agencies and partners in the health and social sectors work together to prevent suicides by promoting upstream prevention, proactively reaching out to pre-empt social isolation and providing support to those at-risk.PreventionFirst, in the area of prevention, it is important to build mental resilience in our population, increase awareness of the importance of good well-being and share information on available community resources for mental health support. For example, the National Council of Social Service recently launched a new Mental Health Public Education Campaign that aims to de-stigmatise mental health issues and encourage help-seeking behaviour. The Health Promotion Board (HPB) helps older adults learn more about mental well-being and resilience through the National Seniors' Health Programme in the community and at workplaces.Proactive Outreach and SupportSecond, we need programmes to pre-empt social isolation, especially for seniors who live alone or have weak social support. For example, we are building communities of care through the Community Networks for Seniors, which will be progressively expanded to achieve nationwide coverage by 2020. The Community Networks for Seniors (CNS) will connect seniors, identified by the Silver Generation Ambassadors, who are single or live alone as to a befriender. To date, there are over 1,000 befrienders serving more than 3,200 seniors. This complements the efforts of Senior Activity Centres that reach out to seniors in the community. Seniors living alone can also be referred to ""Care Line"", a pilot one-stop 24/7 hotline that provides tele-befriending services to those with medical or emotional conditions or facing difficulties in coping. Over 2,100 seniors have enrolled with Care Line to date. We plan to expand Care Line nation-wide to reach out to more seniors across Singapore through partnerships with CNS and other community partners. Identifying At-risk SeniorsThird, we have established services and programmes to support seniors identified to be at higher risk of suicide. The Agency for Integrated Care’s (AIC’s) Community Resource, Engagement and Support Teams (CREST) programme reaches out to seniors at risk of dementia or depression, and teaches them and their caregivers basic social-emotional skills and coping strategies, including where to seek help if needed. Seniors with mild to moderate depression may be referred to counselling and therapy services. Family Service Centres (FSCs) also provide counselling and support services to families with seniors to help them with relationship problems, as well as financial and emotional difficulties.Crisis InterventionsLastly, services are in place to support persons facing a crisis and who require urgent assistance. The Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) operates a 24-hour hotline to counsel persons in distress. Similarly, the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) operates a 24-hour Mental Health Helpline to assess and triage cases, and activate home visit teams if necessary. For cases of attempted suicide, the Police may engage the next-of-kin to link them up with support or refer the individual to IMH for an assessment and treatment, if needed.  The causes of suicide are complex and multifaceted. An interaction of factors such as family, social and mental health issues may sometimes trigger suicidal behaviour. Individuals, the community and the government can all play a part in identifying and caring for seniors who may exhibit signs of distress or require emotional support. We will continue to strengthen our inter-agency and multi-pronged efforts."
waiting time for applicants for heavy vehicle season parking in nee soon grc,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for National Development in view of the 370 applicants on the waitlist for heavy vehicle season parking spaces in and around Nee Soon GRC (a) how long will the waiting time be; and (b) what is the Ministry doing to expedite the waiting process.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: As of mid-July 2018, there were 339 applicants on the wait list for the 845 public heavy vehicle parking (HVP) spaces in and around Nee Soon. The waiting time will vary depending on how many drivers give up their parking spaces, the length of wait list, and the number of spaces for each parking lot. Besides the public HVP spaces, applicants can also take up private HVP spaces in the area, where there are vacancies available.On a nation-wide basis, as of mid-July 2018, the 42,372 HVP spaces far exceeded the 33,500 heavy vehicles registered with LTA. All registered heavy vehicles are required to have a designated overnight HVP space. Those who prefer to remain on the waiting list for public HVP spaces should continue to park at their designated parking lot, or explore alternative spaces via LTA's one-motoring website. Business owners should also work out the appropriate transport options for their HVP drivers to commute to and from work.While HVP drivers would like to park near their homes, we have also received feedback from local residents about noise and safety concerns arising from the heavy vehicle traffic. Land near residential areas is also needed for housing and community needs. It is therefore difficult to continue meeting the demand for HVP spaces in residential areas. Instead, if and when existing public HVP spaces in residential areas are phased out due to development plans, we will introduce HVP spaces in industrial sites sold through the Government Land Sales programme near the area, where possible."
sectors that have successfully use professional conversion programme to recruit mid-career jobseekers,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Manpower (a) which are the top three sectors that have successfully used the Professional Conversion Programme to recruit mid-career jobseekers; and (b) what are the success factors.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: Under the Adapt and Grow initiative, the Professional Conversion Programmes (PCPs) provide training and salary support to companies to hire and train individuals who are switching into new jobs or sectors. Workforce Singapore (WSG) currently offers over 100 PCPs in about 30 sectors. In 2017, about 3,800 individuals were placed through PCPs. The top three sectors were Early Childhood Care and Education, General Manufacturing and Marine. These three sectors accounted for about one in three placements last year. The success of PCPs depends chiefly on the participation of progressive employers who adopt a ""plug-train-play"" mindset. The employers on our PCPs are prepared to hire and train Singaporean workers who may not have the full set of skills and experience preferred for the job, but have the potential to do the job with some effort in training. In addition, about 500 of the PCP placements in 2017 came from PCPs where employers partnered WSG to retrain existing staff whose jobs were being phased out, and redeploy them into new job roles within the same company. Redeployment PCPs are a new area of focus, given the increasing pace of technological disruption and company transformations. This requires companies to plan ahead for their workforce needs, and work closely with WSG and economic agencies on suitable retraining to be able to redeploy staff into new job roles."
alternative remedies to reinstatement for those seeking mediation for unfair dismissal,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Manpower with regard to persons undergoing mediation by the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM) for alleged unfair dismissal (a) whether there are remedies other than reinstatement that are provided in the law given that the complainant may prefer other forms of redress instead; and (b) if so, in what proportion of alleged unfair dismissal mediation cases have non-reinstatement remedies been applied in each of the past five years and what have been these remedies.","Mrs Josephine Teo: The Employment Act empowers the Minister for Manpower to direct an employer to reinstate an employee who has been wrongfully dismissed in his former job and to pay the employee for the loss of income, or direct the employer to compensate the employee.  An average of 200 employees sought assistance for wrongful dismissal each year, in the past five years. Following mediation, slightly more than half of the cases came to an amicable settlement with payments to the employee. Another 10% of cases were settled through other mutual agreements between employer and employee such as converting the employee’s dismissal into a resignation or the employer providing the employee with a service testimonial. A further 20% of the cases were withdrawn by the employee. These cases account for about 80% of the cases. The remaining 20% of the cases were escalated to the Minister for Manpower for a decision. Where an employee is found to have been wrongfully dismissed, compensation is generally preferred to reinstatement at this stage because the employer-employee relationship would have been strained and reinstatement would not be practical. In the last five years, where wrongful dismissal is substantiated, the Minister has ordered compensation instead of reinstatement."
cost savings given liberalisation of electricity market for jurong region,Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for Trade and Industry with liberalisation of the electricity market for the Jurong region since 1 April 2018 (a) how many eligible households have opted to switch from buying electricity from SP Group; and (b) what is the average cost savings experienced by these households who chose the alternative providers.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: The Energy Market Authority introduced the Open Electricity Market in Jurong in April 2018, providing around 120,000 households and small businesses with the choice to buy electricity from a retailer with a price plan that best meets their needs. Consumers who do not wish to switch to a retailer can remain with SP Group and continue buying electricity at the regulated tariff, and there is no deadline for switching. This soft launch has gone well. As of mid-September 2018, more than 30% of Jurong households have switched to a retailer. These households are paying an average electricity rate that is 20% lower than the regulated tariff. EMA will progressively extend the Open Electricity Market to the rest of Singapore from 1 November 2018."
monopolising of hospital cleaning contracts,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the current total number of cleaning service providers that are contracted by the different hospitals under the Ministry; and (b) how does the Ministry ensure that other cleaning companies have the chance to build their capacity in this sector and prevent the hospital cleaning contracts from being monopolised.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Our three public healthcare clusters – National University Health System (NUHS), National Healthcare Group (NHG) and Singapore Health Services (SingHealth) – are currently served by four different cleaning providers. All three clusters adopt an open process in selecting cleaning providers. Tenders are open to all cleaning companies, including those that are not currently contracted, and bidders can submit bids for consolidated contracts or sub-components of contracts. This arrangement enables smaller and newer vendors to participate in the tenders. Submitted tenders are evaluated for both price and quality, so as to ensure that the cleaning providers have the operational capabilities to meet our healthcare institutions' requirements in a cost effective way."
review of retirement age,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar asked the Minister for Manpower whether there are plans to review the retirement age and push it up to 65 years old automatically without any disruption to salary or benefits in light of Singaporeans living longer.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: Earlier this year, I announced the formation of the Tripartite Workgroup on Older Workers (TWG-OW). Among other things, the Workgroup will review the longer-term relevance of the retirement and re-employment age, and consider the next steps that will best address the needs of our economy and society. The TWG-OW held its first meeting last month. It has started to gather views from different groups and will consider the matter holistically, taking into the account the perspectives of both workers, employers, and other stakeholders. MOM hopes to share the Workgroup's initial set of findings at the Committee of Supply debate next year."
imported fresh durians found tainted with excessive chemical agents,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development whether there have been any imported fresh durians that have failed the food safety check or found to be contaminated or tainted with chemicals or excessive chemical agents that were not allowed to be imported for the past three years.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: As part of its food safety regime, AVA inspects and takes samples from imported fruits, including durians, to ensure that they comply with our standards and requirements. Samples are tested for the presence of pesticide residues and other non-permitted chemicals. Imported fruits that fail AVA's inspection and food safety tests will not be allowed for sale. Over the past three years, all the durian samples tested have met our food safety standards."
"prosecutions, convictions and investigations carried out against human trafficking cases","Prof Fatimah Lateef asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether he can provide an update on the number of prosecutions, convictions and investigations carried out against cases of human trafficking in the last three years; and (b) what is the Government's response to Singapore's position in Tier 2 of the 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report published by the US Department of State.","Mr K Shanmugam: Since the Prevention of Human Trafficking Act (PHTA) was enacted in 2015, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and the Singapore Police Force (SPF) have received information on and investigated 177 cases of alleged sex and labour trafficking. Eight were found to be substantiated as trafficking cases, while the other 169 were not. Of the eight trafficking cases, four cases have been concluded with four persons convicted under the PHTA, fined up to $30,000, and sentenced to imprisonment terms ranging from 38 to 80 months. The remaining four cases are still undergoing court proceedings. The United States (US) Department of State’s ranking of Singapore in Tier 2 of the 2018 Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report means that, in their view, we do not fully meet the ""minimum standards"" for the Elimination of Trafficking in Persons under the US Trafficking Victims Protection Act 2000, but we are making ""significant efforts"".  We do not share the US' view. Our laws are tough and fair, and our approach to human trafficking is, like our approach to any other crime, uncompromising. The report misrepresents ground realities. For example, the report alleges that ""large numbers"" of migrant workers experience conditions indicative of labour trafficking in Singapore, but provides no statistics to back this claim. On the contrary, MOM surveyed about 1,000 foreign domestic workers in 2015, and found that approximately 97% of them were satisfied with working in Singapore, and approximately 80% said that they would recommend Singapore to their friends and relatives as a place to work. The results were similar to an earlier survey done in 2014. The report also claims that Police did not consistently screen for trafficking indicators among women apprehended in law enforcement operations. On the contrary, all persons found to have been engaging in vice activities are interviewed and assessed by the Police to ascertain if they might be TIP victims. Frontline officers from MOM, SPF and Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) are issued with a 'TIP awareness card' containing the key elements and indicators of TIP to aid their identification of possible victims. They are then referred to specialised TIP units in MOM or SPF for follow-up investigations. Singapore takes a serious view of TIP. We have in place robust laws and processes, as well as a committed and competent law enforcement system, to ensure that we are not a destination for human traffickers. We have achieved several significant milestones in our efforts against TIP, such as the enactment of PHTA in 2015, which prescribes severe penalties for such crimes. This includes a mandatory prison sentence of up to 10 years. For first-time offenders, the court may also impose a fine of up to S$100,000 and caning of up to six strokes. For recalcitrant offenders, the law prescribes mandatory caning of up to nine strokes.  In addition to investigating and prosecuting trafficking cases under the PHTA, Singapore also adopts a proactive approach to detect and deal early with cases that have the potential to become TIP cases. Our wider legal framework comprises various pieces of legislation to protect women and workers in Singapore, such as the Women's Charter and Employment of Foreign Manpower Act. Under this framework, enforcement agencies like SPF and MOM conduct regular operations to detect and deter illegal activities that may be indicative of human trafficking, such as vice activities and illegal labour. Our pre-emptive enforcement stance has helped to keep the number of TIP cases low. The PHTA also provides measures for the care of TIP victims to encourage the reporting of trafficking activities. These include mandatory in-camera court proceedings for child victims, media gag-order for all proceedings involving sexual exploitation, and protection for informers to incentivise the reporting of TIP activity.  In addition to the enactment of PHTA, Singapore acceded to the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children (""UN TIP Protocol"") in 2015. The UN TIP Protocol lays out international standards for the elimination of TIP, and seeks to prevent, suppress and punish TIP perpetrators while protecting victims and promoting cooperation among State Parties to meet these objectives. Singapore is fully in compliance with the Protocol. The Singapore Inter-Agency Taskforce on Trafficking in Persons (""TIP Taskforce""), formed in 2010 and comprising six ministries, the Police, ICA, and Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC), actively engages various stakeholders, including Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), embassies and academics, to co-develop our strategy to combat TIP. The TIP Taskforce conducted its annual stakeholder engagement session in July 2018, which was attended by over 40 stakeholders. The TIP Taskforce also regularly engages the U.S. on TIP-related matters. We have consistently clarified the misrepresentations set out in this and previous annual reports, but regrettably, the misconceptions remain. We strongly urge the U.S. to seek clarification and better understand Singapore's actual ground situation and approach to combat TIP, and not make unsubstantiated claims. "
deter taking of voyeuristic photos or videos with hidden cameras,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is being done to deter the taking of voyeuristic photos or videos involving hidden cameras; and (b) whether there has been an increase in the number of police investigations and prosecutions related to this offence.,"Mr K Shanmugam: We encourage victims of voyeurism to make a Police report as soon as possible. It gives us a better chance of apprehending the culprit. Under our current laws, those found guilty of taking voyeuristic photos or videos are liable to imprisonment of up to one year, or a fine, or both.The Penal Code Review Committee (PCRC) has made recommendations to strengthen deterrence against voyeurism. It has recommended introducing new offences relating to the making, distribution, possession, and accessing of voyeuristic recordings. The PCRC has also recommended that offenders who make such recordings be liable to imprisonment of up to two years, or a fine, or both, and caning. The penalty will be enhanced if the victim is below 14 years of age. The Government has just completed its public consultation on the PCRC's recommendations, and will take the public feedback into consideration when making our decisions.The number of voyeurism cases involving hidden cameras investigated by the Police has increased in the last few years. This is partly because more people are willing to step forward to report the cases. Between 2013 and 2017, the number increased from about 150 to about 230 per year. About a quarter of these cases resulted in court prosecution."
basis for ica's blacklisting of ms clare rewcastle-brown,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is the basis for ICA's blacklisting of Ms Clare Rewcastle-Brown; (b) what is the reason given to our Government for the blacklisting request; (c) who requested the blacklisting; and (d) whether the Ministry or ICA has (i) a policy of objective review of the bona fides of all blacklisting requests from a foreign state or leader and (ii) a system of regular reviews of existing blacklistings.,"Mr K Shanmugam: ICA decides on a foreigner's right to enter into Singapore, taking into account a variety of factors, including our national interests and security, based on our own information and assessment, as well as that provided by foreign partners. We also do not, generally, confirm or deny whether a person has been blacklisted.Ms Clare Rewcastle Brown was granted entry into Singapore on 14 September 2018. She was not stopped or questioned. On 15 September 2018, Ms Brown left Singapore. When she was leaving, she was interviewed by ICA officers as part of the immigration clearance process. Our records showed that she completed her immigration clearance and interview in 16 minutes. Many travellers are subjected to additional checks or interviews as part of the immigration clearance process. Ms Brown was not denied entry into Singapore – she was allowed to enter Singapore. Members can assess for themselves how credible it is, to assume that a person had been blacklisted, because she was asked some questions when she was leaving the country – when she had not been denied entry into the country in the first place."
job creation and economic value-add from opening of changi airport’s jewel,"Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Transport with the impending opening of Changi Airport's Jewel (a) what, and how many, jobs will be created; (b) what is the economic value of the jobs created; and (c) how will the Ministry help to place Singaporeans into these jobs.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Jewel Changi Airport (Jewel) is targeted to open in the first half of 2019. It will increase Changi Airport's capacity by three million passengers a year and enhance Changi Airport's attractiveness as an air hub. Its offerings include airport facilities, a 130-room hotel, gardens, shopping and dining facilities, and play attractions.Jewel is expected to create close to 3,000 jobs. While the new jobs will mainly be in the retail and Food and Beverage sectors, there will also be jobs in hospitality, customer service, and horticulture. We expect the manpower productivity and value add of each employee at Jewel to be enhanced through leveraging technology and working closely with partners and retailers.Most of the recruitment will be driven by the individual retailers and companies operating in Jewel. Nevertheless, in the lead-up to the opening of Jewel, Changi Airport Group (CAG) will link up with Workforce Singapore (WSG) and the Employment and Employability Institute (e2i) to enable job matching between these retailers and companies and suitable Singaporean applicants."
strategy and sustainable actions to handle drug-related problems in geylang,"Prof Fatimah Lateef asked the Minister for Home Affairs what is the strategy and sustainable action to handle the drug-related issues in the back lanes and coffee shops in Geylang, in particular Lorong 22 to Lorong 40.","Mr K Shanmugam: The Police, Central Narcotics Bureau and Health Sciences Authority adopt a coordinated and multi-agency approach to tackle illicit activities in Geylang. This includes frequent joint patrols and enforcement operations.These efforts are augmented by the deployment of auxiliary police officers, who also perform high-visibility patrols and enforce against a wide range of regulatory offences.The Police have also installed more cameras and improved the lighting in Geylang to enhance the deterrence and detection of illicit activities, especially at the back lanes. There are now close to 300 cameras in Geylang, six times more than in 2014.  With these sustained efforts by the law enforcement agencies, including at Lorong 22 to Lorong 40, the crime, drug and illegal medicine situation in Geylang remains under control. We will continue our tough enforcement approach, and further step up as necessary. We will also continue to work closely with the local grassroots, residents, business operators and other Government agencies."
requests for more high sheltered linkways across roads and crossings,Prof Fatimah Lateef asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether he can provide an update and findings on the pilot for high covered linkways across roads and crossings; and (b) when is the expected roll out for some of the long pending requests.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Under its Walk2Ride Programme, LTA has completed 200 km of covered linkways last month. These include around 900 high covered linkways across roads of up to three lanes wide. LTA has also received requests for high covered linkways over roads with four lanes or more. As these linkways are longer and span across roads more frequently used by faster vehicles, they need to be properly reinforced to prevent a collapse of the linkway should a vehicle hit its supporting columns. The additional reinforcements take up more space and require more civil works and diversions. As a result, these linkways are more expensive to construct, costing around $550,000 each. This is six times more costly than high covered linkways over two- or three-lane roads. LTA will need to carefully assess and prioritise the construction of such linkways, taking into account inputs from the local communities."
breakdown of traffic lights in bad weather conditions,"Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Transport (a) over the last five years, how many incidences of traffic lights breaking down as a result of short circuits during heavy rain have occurred; and (b) what is being done to ensure that our traffic systems remain in working condition during bad weather.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Since 2009, LTA has installed automatic circuit re-closer devices in all traffic lights, which serve to safely restore traffic light operations in the event of power trips. This has drastically reduced the number of traffic lights breakdowns during heavy rain from over 800 a year to an average of 35 a year. LTA also works closely with Singtel and SP Group to ensure smooth communications and power supply to our traffic light systems.  LTA monitors Singapore's road system round the clock. When traffic lights break down, LTA responds within 20 minutes at high-priority locations, and 30 minutes at other locations. Where necessary, LTA and the Traffic Police will work together to assist in traffic management at affected junctions while the traffic lights are being repaired."
advice for hdb flat applications on eligibility for hdb loan and instalment amounts,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry asked the Minister for National Development whether HDB flat applicants are given detailed advice on their eligibility for a HDB loan including the appropriate quantum to ensure that applicants will not over-commit and be unable to secure a loan after being successfully allocated the flat.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: New flat buyers who wish to take up an HDB housing loan are required to apply for an HDB Loan Eligibility (HLE) letter before they book a flat. The HLE letter provides them with useful information for financial planning, such as the loan amount, interest rate, repayment period and monthly instalment payable. During the flat booking appointment, HDB conducts financial counselling to help home buyers understand the costs involved in their flat purchase, the different financing options, for instance how they can finance the flat by using their CPF savings, housing loan and/or cash, and the implications of these options.  HDB will continue to remind home seekers to exercise financial prudence, and buy a flat within their budget."
measures to protect private-hire vehicle drivers against harassment from commuters,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry can introduce measures to better protect private-hire vehicle drivers against harassment from commuters.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Under the Protection from Harassment Act (POHA), it is an offence to use any threatening, abusive or insulting words, or behave in such a manner that is likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress to the victim. Commuters who contravene an offence under POHA may be liable upon conviction to fines and/or imprisonment. We will continue to work with the National Private Hire Vehicles Association and the private hire car (PHC) booking service operators to ensure that PHC drivers can work in a safe environment."
initiatives to ensure compliance with advisory guidelines for nric and other identification numbers,Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Communications and Information in light of the updated Advisory Guidelines issued by the Personal Data Protection Commission for NRIC and other national identification numbers (a) what are the initiatives that will be taken to ensure organisations review and implement the necessary changes to their business practices and processes to be aligned to the guidelines; (b) how will enforcement be carried out to check on organisations who continue to inappropriately collect NRIC numbers and ensure those who had previously done so dispose of these sensitive data in a proper manner; and (c) what is the platform and process for consumers or members of the public who wish to make a report on organisations who inappropriately collect NRIC numbers.,"Mr S Iswaran: The Personal Data Protection Commission, or PDPC, recently updated its Advisory Guidelines on the collection, use and disclosure of NRIC and other national identification numbers. In summary, the Guidelines set out that organisations are allowed to do so only if it is required by the law, or if it is necessary to accurately establish or verify an individual's identity to a high degree of fidelity.The PDPC, together with the Infocomm Media Development Authority, or IMDA, is adopting a two-pronged approach to help organisations align their practices with the Guidelines. Firstly, PDPC is increasing awareness among organisations of the Guidelines through its outreach activities. For example, PDPC has briefed trade associations on the Guidelines. PDPC will also be carrying out additional briefings and producing collaterals for distribution to companies. Secondly, PDPC and IMDA are providing organisations with technical support to make the transition. These include a technical guide on alternatives to NRIC numbers for websites and public facing computer systems; a template to notify customers of the organisation's efforts and time frame to comply with the Guidelines; and pre-approved solutions that organisations can adopt, such as visitor management and customer management systems. Organisations can reach out to PDPC or PDPC's panel of Data Protection Advisors for assistance.To allow organisations adequate time to review and refine their existing business practices and processes to comply with the Guidelines, they will take effect on 1 September 2019. Thereafter, individuals who encounter non-compliance can lodge a complaint with the PDPC. PDPC will review each complaint and take appropriate actions, such as directing non-complying organisations to dispose of the data and imposing financial penalties."
evaluation process for approving citizenship applications by pr spouses of singaporeans,"Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) how does ICA ensure fairness, transparency and consistency during the evaluation process in approving citizenship applications by PR spouses of Singaporeans; and (b) what are the reasons for not stating the grounds for rejection of citizenship applications especially if spouses of Singaporean are involved.","Mr K Shanmugam: Applications for Singapore Citizenship (SC) are assessed on a range of criteria. The applications are put through a few layers of checks. The same approach is adopted for appeals and subsequent applications.  On the Member's second question, ICA evaluates applications from foreign spouses married to Singaporeans on a range of factors, including the ability of the Singaporean sponsor to support the foreign spouse, the length of marriage, and whether they have any children from the marriage. These general factors are shared openly with the public. However, we do not share the specific criteria or grounds for rejecting applications.(a) Information about detailed assessment criteria can be abused to inflate an undeserving applicant's chances of success. Some people could then try and game the system.(b) Those whose applications have been rejected may also use the reasons for rejection to try and arouse sentiments in other countries, with potential diplomatic implications. This is not in Singapore's interests.  That said, I assure the Members that if they raise specific deserving cases to our attention, we will re-assess them carefully."
proposal to review alumni priority admission scheme for primary 1 registration,"Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Education (a) whether the alumni priority admission scheme for Primary 1 will be reviewed; (b) whether a higher proportion of admission places can be reserved for non-alumni related students in primary schools; and (c) whether in the current system, parents who are alumni members and active contributors have priority over parents who are just dormant alumni members.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: The current Primary 1 (P1) Registration Framework reflects a careful consideration of factors, such as siblings already studying in the school, parental ties to the school, proximity between the school and homes, various forms of voluntary contributions to the school and the community. Each is a valid justification for admission on a priority basis.Like all other policies, MOE reviews the P1 registration framework periodically, and has refined the system over the years after taking into account feedback. The last significant change was for the 2014 P1 Registration Exercise, when we reserved 40 places in every school for registrants in Phase 2B and 2C. This ensures that all schools remain open to children with no prior connections to the school. We will monitor the effects of these changes before deciding if further refinements should be made. MOE will continue to resource all our schools with well-trained teachers, invest in suitable education facilities, and provide support for good school programmes, so that all students can receive a good quality and holistic education, regardless of the school which he or she attends."
applications for term financial assistance for nsfs that were supported by commanders,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Defence (a) whether the figure of 80% of applications approved for Term Financial Assistance (TFA) for NSFs refers only to the applications supported by commanders; and (b) if so, what percentage of applications by NSFs for TFA were not supported by their commanders in the past five years.",Dr Ng Eng Hen: Eighty per cent of all applications for Term Financial Assistance were approved and includes applications that were not supported by the commanders.
impact of brexit on trade between singapore and eu,"Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Trade and Industry in view of Britain's membership of the EU lapsing in about six months, what is the impact on (i) trade between Singapore and the EU (ii) the Singapore-EU Free Trade Agreement and (iii) Singapore companies operating in Britain.","Mr Chan Chun Sing: The UK is an important economic partner of Singapore; as the second largest economy within the EU, and the fifth largest globally. Brexit is expected to take place on 29 Mar 2019. What happens after will depend greatly on the terms negotiated between the UK and the EU. A soft Brexit scenario will include an ""Implementation Period"" from the day the UK formally leaves the EU to 31 Dec 2020. This scenario offers the greatest predictability and stability. This is because during the Implementation Period, the UK will continue to be functionally treated as an EU Member State, and remain a party to EU international agreements. This will include the EU-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (EUSFTA) when it is ratified by the Euoprean Parliament as targeted in 2019. Disruptions to trade and investment flows would be minimised and business continuity would be preserved while the UK irons out its future trade and investment relationships with other partners, including Singapore. In the event of a hard Brexit where there is no deal between the UK and the EU, the UK will cease to be a party to the EU’s agreements with third countries when it formally leaves the EU. This would mean that the EUSFTA will not apply between the UK and Singapore even after its ratification. This in itself would not impact our trading relationship with the UK as the current tariff and non-tariff regime for Singapore companies are based on WTO terms (pending EUSFTA ratification) which will continue to apply. The UK Secretary of State for International Trade Dr Liam Fox and his officials have affirmed that the UK's priority post-Brexit is to ensure that its bilateral trade ties, as well as companies operating in the UK, are not disrupted. MTI's assessment is that trade between the UK and Singapore, as well as companies invested in the UK's domestic sectors, will not be structurally affected. Nonetheless, as Brexit is a major development, some volatility is to be expected. In addition, companies based in the UK, which use the UK as a gateway to access opportunities in the EU single market, will be impacted. The magnitude will depend on where the UK and the EU land on their future trade and economic relationship where it pertains to their common market today. Access to talent and general labour supply could also be impacted if immigration conditions are more stringent between the UK and the EU. MTI and Enterprise Singapore have continued to work closely with Singapore companies that remain keen to expand in the UK. The UK is home to a diverse range of Singapore companies from sectors such as engineering, infrastructure, medical technology, digital, transport, lifestyle, real estate and hospitality. In some sectors, Singapore companies1 have made new investments in the UK even after the referendum in 2016, after careful assessment of the UK's continued potential alongside the attendant risks despite the imminence of Brexit, pointing to our companies’ continued confidence in the UK economy. Pending the final post-Brexit arrangements with the EU, MTI is in close discussions with the UK Department of International Trade on how we can strengthen our strong and multifaceted bilateral relationship. Meanwhile, work on the EUSFTA is on track. The EUSFTA will deepen our robust bilateral trade and investments with the EU. Even as the UK prepares to leave the EU, British leaders have continued to reaffirm their support for the EU's free trade agenda, including for the EUSFTA."
"accidents involving children under age of 12 at commercial playgrounds, carnivals, fun fairs and amusement parks","Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for National Development (a) in the last five years, how many accidents involving children under the age of 12 have occurred at commercial playgrounds, carnivals, fun fairs and amusement parks; (b) what measures are in place to ensure child safety; and (c) whether the Ministry has plans to review and update safety requirements at such venues.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Since 2013, there have been 17 reported incidents on amusement rides involving children under the age of 12, which required medical treatment beyond basic first aid. Of the 17 incidents, 16 were due to user behaviour, and only one case in 2014 was due to a safety lapse on the ride operator's part. BCA, which regulates amusement rides in Singapore, took enforcement action against the ride operator, and the safety lapse was rectified before the ride was reopened to the public.  Under the Amusement Rides Safety Act, amusement rides have to be designed, maintained and operated according to internationally recognised safety codes and standards. Rides that are low-powered or battery-operated, including rides in playgrounds, are excluded from the regulatory framework, as they pose relatively lower risk.  The ride operator is responsible for the safety of amusement ride operations. Amongst other measures, the operator is required to appoint a Ride Manager to manage and supervise the daily operations and routine maintenance of the ride. For example, the Ride Manager needs to ensure that a thorough inspection is done before the ride is opened for public use each day, and that only trained persons operate the ride.Some rides have restrictions, for instance, that patrons must be above a specified height, or within a specified weight. This is due to the design of the ride seats and safety restraints. Operators are required to inform patrons if rides have such restrictions, and to conduct checks to ensure compliance.BCA also conducts inspections on the operation and maintenance of amusement rides. If safety issues are detected, BCA will take action as required, such as suspending the operations of the ride. This year, BCA has conducted more than 250 inspections of amusement rides in Singapore as of August 2018.We will continue to work closely with the industry to ensure that amusement rides are designed, maintained, and operated according to prescribed safety standards. Ride users can also play a part in creating a safe and fun experience for themselves and their families by adhering to the safety guidelines."
eligibility of unemployed single person above 35 years old with disability for additional cpf housing grant and special cpf housing grant,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for National Development whether an unemployed single person above 35 years old with a disability is eligible for the Additional CPF Housing Grant (AHG) and Special CPF Housing Grant (SHG) when the person wishes to buy a HDB flat under the Singles Scheme.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The purchase of a flat is a long-term financial commitment. Hence, it is important for flat buyers to have steady employment to ensure that they are financially able to service the housing loan and sustain ownership of the flat over the long term.HDB provides the Additional CPF Housing Grant (AHG) and the Special CPF Housing Grant (SHG) to help low- to middle-income households buy their first homes. To assess the household's income fairly, we require at least one applicant to have worked continuously for at least 12 months prior to the flat application, and remain working at the point of flat application. A person who is unfit for work due to disability may apply for the grants with eligible family members, or other eligible singles under the Joint Singles Scheme. For cases where a person is unfit for work due to a disability, and would like to buy a flat under the Single Singapore Citizen Scheme with the help of grants, he/she may approach HDB for assistance. HDB will assess such requests, taking into account whether the appellants are able to produce a medical certification that they are unfit for work due to illness or disability, and whether they are able to sustain the flat purchase over the long term without employment."
amount of compensation payable to flats buyers who have to cancel their purchase due to divorce or nullity of marriage,Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for National Development whether HDB can review the amount of compensation payable to purchasers of flats who have to cancel their purchase due to divorce or nullity of marriage.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The financial forfeiture for cancellation ensures that flat applicants are committed to their purchase. This is necessary as HDB sets aside flats for successful applicants, and has to turn away other applicants as a result. The forfeiture also covers the holding and administrative costs incurred by HDB as a result of the flat cancellation. Flat buyers who cancel their application after signing the Agreement For Lease but before key collection will receive a partial refund of the downpayment made for the flat, if the downpayment was more than 5% of the flat price. As for flat buyers who return their flat to HDB after they have collected their keys, they may receive substantial compensation of up to 95% of the flat price. In cases where the cancellation of the flat purchase is due to a change in family nucleus, for instance due to divorce, HDB can allow one of the parties to retain the flat by including another eligible person into their flat application, subject to the outgoing party's consent. There is no financial forfeiture involved for such cases. If they are unable to retain the flat, HDB will look into their individual circumstances and can exercise flexibility if they have extenuating circumstances such as financial hardship."
disputes between neighbours linked to cigarette smoke,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for National Development (a) in the past year, how many disputes between neighbours have been reported to HDB; (b) how many were because of cigarette smoke; (c) how many were mediated successfully; and (d) whether there have been any disputes that were escalated to Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals or other channels.","Mr Lawrence Wong: In 2017, HDB received 3,493 instances of feedback regarding disputes between neighbours. Of these, 216 instances, or about 6%, were related to smoking.It is natural that disagreements arise between neighbours from time-to-time, and in general, it is best for such disputes to be settled informally between the parties involved. Where mediation is required, residents can approach the Community Mediation Centre (CMC), which provides trained neutral parties to help neighbours arrive at mutually acceptable solutions. In 2017, 24 cases involving disputes arising from cigarette smoke were registered with the CMC, of which two proceeded to mediation. Both cases were successfully mediated. For intractable cases where parties are unable to resolve their disputes, aggrieved parties can file a case with the Community Disputes Resolutions Tribunals (CDRT) as a last resort. The CDRT judge can order parties to attend mandatory mediation in the Courts or at the CMC, to attend counselling, or to fix the case for hearing by the Courts. There were no cases pertaining to cigarette smoke filed with the CDRT in 2017."
precautionary measures for fruits from australia after poisoned fruit scare,"Mr Chong Kee Hiong asked the Minister for National Development in view of the recent incidents of fruits sabotaged with needles in Australia, what precautionary measures are in place for fruits imported from Australia.","Mr Lawrence Wong: As part of its food safety regime, AVA regularly inspects and conducts sampling of imported fruits to ensure that they comply with our standards and requirements. Imported fruits that fail AVA’s food safety inspections will not be allowed for sale.Following the reports of needles found in Australian strawberries, AVA has been in close communication with the Australian authorities, which have implemented additional export control measures. From 19 September 2018, exporters have been required to provide assurance, such as evidence of metal detector or x-ray screening, to Australian authorities that their consignments of fresh strawberries are free from metal contaminants prior to export.AVA will continue to closely monitor the situation and take action where necessary."
investigation into data register pte ltd for passing off as government agency,Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether the directors of Data Register Pte Ltd (previously known as Company Register Pte Ltd) will be investigated for any offence of cheating or deceiving companies/businesses by representing that they are a government agency; and (b) whether contracts entered into by companies/businesses due to such deception can be voided.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The Police have received several reports against Data Register Pte Ltd in 2018. The Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority and law enforcement agencies are looking into the reports and consulting the Attorney-General's Chambers.In the meantime, businesses should seek legal advice if they are of the view that they had been misled or deceived into entering into contracts with Data Register."
latest findings on harmful effects of alcohol consumption,Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked the Minister for Health in view of the latest findings showing the harmful effects of alcohol consumption and that there is likely no safe level of alcohol consumption (a) whether the Ministry will consider lowering the recommended limit for alcohol consumption to no more than two standard drinks a day for men and no more than one for women; and (b) how will the Ministry conduct an updated public education programme to inform Singaporeans and residents.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong:  The current recommended limit for regular alcohol consumption in Singapore is already two standard drinks a day for men and one standard drink a day for women as suggested by Dr Chia. According to the latest National Population Health Survey, 2.3% of Singaporeans aged 18-69 years exceeded the recommended limit in 2017. Although this was an increase from 1.4% in 2007, our alcohol consumption is still among the lowest in Asia1.Together with its partners, the Health Promotion Board (HPB)'s current strategy is focused on raising awareness on the harms of alcohol consumption and binge drinking among youth. HPB worked with the Ministry of Education (MOE) to include information on the harmful effects of alcohol in the school curriculum for all students at primary and secondary schools. Information on the effects of excessive alcohol consumption, particularly binge drinking, is embedded in the lifeskills programme and health related activities for ITE and Polytechnic students, as well as national servicemen. Similar information is also made available to members of the public on HPB's Healthhub website.HPB also collaborates with other agencies such as the National Addictions Management Service and Traffic Police to include pertinent messages on sensible drinking in their campaigns. MOH and HPB will continue to take into consideration evidence that is relevant and applicable to our local context when reviewing recommended limits and public education initiatives. We will also continue to closely monitor the trends of regular alcohol consumption and binge drinking in Singapore."
setting aside more places in primary schools for residents living within one km,"Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for Education whether more places in primary schools can be set aside for residents living within 1 km of the primary school if, historically, there are consistently insufficient places for students living in the vicinity of the school.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: MOE regularly reviews the demand and supply trends at the national and regional levels to ensure that there are sufficient school places for school-going children, taking into account the current and projected population as well as planned housing development programmes. MOE ensures that there are sufficient places for all eligible Singaporean Primary One-going children within a reasonable distance from their homes. For the last three P1 Registration Exercises, about 98% of the registrants were able to obtain a place in a primary school of their choice, or a primary school within 2km of their residence. While MOE plans the location of schools and the number of vacancies carefully, it is not possible to predict exactly how many students will register in a particular school in a particular year. The number changes from year to year, and proximity to the school is not the sole determinant of choice of school. For example, some parents may prefer to register their children in schools further away of which the parents are alumni, or where the grandparents live. In determining the number of classes for each school, MOE also has to calibrate the intake with the capacity of the school so as to ensure an optimum learning environment for all students. In instances where there are insufficient vacancies in the school of their choice, we encourage parents to consider other primary schools near their residential address. MOE will continue to ensure every school is resourced with well-trained teachers, investing in their facilities, and ensuring sufficient support for good school programmes, so that every student can receive a good quality and holistic education, regardless of the school which he or she attends."
impact of rise of factoryless goods producing firms on singapore's economic competitiveness and exports,Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for Trade and Industry how has the rise in the number of factoryless goods producing firms changed Singapore's economic competitiveness and its capacity to export; and (b) what are the implications to job creation and prospects as well as overall economic value-add in Singapore.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: Singapore's manufacturing ecosystem has become more diverse over the years, with a shift towards higher-value activities. This includes a rise in the number of Factoryless Goods Producing Firms (FGPFs). These are firms that undertake pre-production activities such as R&D and product design in Singapore, but outsource the physical production to another company, which could be located in Singapore or overseas. FGPFs contribute to our economy in several ways. First, due to the high-value nature of their activities in Singapore, FGPFs contributed to 5.2% of the value-added of the manufacturing sector in 2016, even though they accounted for around 0.5% of manufacturing firms. They also provide business to firms in supporting industries that are engaged in logistics, sales and marketing.Second, FGPFs generate skilled and well-paying jobs. In 2016, FGPFs accounted for around 2,700 jobs in the manufacturing sector. Around two-thirds of these jobs were filled by Singaporeans. About 80% of the 2,700 jobs were skilled jobs that provide higher salaries for the workers.  Third, FGPFs conduct R&D with local contract manufacturers and equipment suppliers to jointly develop advanced production processes. Such partnerships help to strengthen the capabilities and competitiveness of our manufacturing sector.Manufacturing remains an important part of Singapore's economy. The Government will continue to strengthen and upgrade our manufacturing capabilities by attracting investments in both production and production-related services, and helping Singapore companies to raise their productivity and move into higher-value manufacturing activities."
impact on local businesses and smes of singaporeans and prs shopping in malaysia,Mr Seah Kian Peng asked the Minister for Trade and Industry what is the impact to local businesses especially SMEs of Singaporeans and permanent residents shopping in Malaysia and Johore in particular.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: The Government does not have data on overseas spending by Singaporeans and permanent residents.  Singapore retailers face competition not just from shops in Malaysia, but also from other countries due to online shopping and more convenient air connections. This increases competition for local businesses, but it benefits Singapore consumers.  Competition is a two-way street. Our businesses can also draw customers from overseas by offering greater value, higher quality products, or better service levels. Indeed, tourist spending on shopping in Singapore has grown by 4% from 2016 to 2017.Some of our SMEs have developed creative marketing strategies. For example, home grown furniture brand Commune has a retail experience centre at Defu Lane that enhances the shopping experience of its customers. The retail experience centre's 3D floor planner and virtual reality simulation allow customers to recreate their homes and visualise Commune's furniture within their spaces. The Singapore economy has thrived because of competition. It drives us to improve our capabilities and up our game, including expanding our international presence and exporting our products and services to overseas markets."
e-commerce scams on online marketplaces,"Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Home Affairs in view of the increase in e-commerce scams on online marketplaces (a) what is the solving rate for such cases; (b) how many offenders have been prosecuted so far, and (c) how is the Ministry working with e-commerce companies to protect users.","Mr K Shanmugam: Only a minority of e-commerce scams have been solved. One reason is that a significant proportion of online crimes, including e-commerce scams, are committed by syndicates based overseas. Online crimes are also difficult to solve due to the anonymity provided by the internet.For the same reasons, the number of persons prosecuted is low compared to the number of scams reported.Police have been working with operators of online platforms to put in place measures to better protect users. The online platforms have put up advisories on how users can minimise their risk of falling victim to scams – for example, to require cash on delivery and to check the items carefully before completing the transaction. If advance payments are required, users should make use of secured payment systems. For example, Carousell has recently introduced CarouPay, an escrow payment system. Using the system, payment will only be released to the sellers after the buyers have acknowledged receipt of the items purchased. "
regular inspection and pruning of trees along roads,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for National Development (a) how regularly are trees along roads inspected and pruned to ensure that they do not overshadow street lamps; and (b) how many instances of feedback have been received from the public concerning trees covering street lamps in the past year.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: NParks oversees about two million urban trees across Singapore. Depending on their species, trees are pruned at least once or twice a year prior to the monsoon seasons. NParks also conducts regular health inspections on its trees. Additional pruning may be carried out as a result of these inspections. While pruning is usually carried out to improve the structure and balance of trees, NParks also ensures that branches do not block the light from street lamps during its pruning exercises. In 2017, NParks received about 200 reports from the public, about trees blocking street lamps. These made up less than one per cent of the feedback that NParks receives per year on roadside greenery. If members of the public spot trees covering street lamps, they can report it through the OneService mobile app or by calling the NParks hotline.   "
plans for polyclinic in braddell heights constituency,Mr Seah Kian Peng asked the Minister for Health whether there are any plans for a polyclinic in Braddell Heights constituency.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: MOH conducts regular reviews of subsidised primary care facilities in different geographical localities, including Braddell Heights and the surrounding areas. In doing so, we will take into account the existing subsidised capacity in CHAS GPs and polyclinics in the areas as well as the projected primary care demand. Meanwhile, residents within the Braddell Heights constituency can seek subsidised primary care at nearby polyclinics located in Toa Payoh, Hougang or Geylang, and nine CHAS GP clinics in the Braddell Heights area."
alleged improper transfer of s$10 million to obike hong kong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether the former directors and management of oBike Singapore will be investigated by the Commercial Affairs Department for any alleged improper transfer to oBike Hong Kong of about S$10 million that is allegedly collected from its former Singapore customers by way of prepayment.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The Police are investigating oBike Asia Pte Ltd (or ""oBike Singapore"") for misappropriation of funds. As investigations are ongoing, we are unable to comment further."
private developments on freehold land sold as 99-year leasehold properties,"Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling asked the Minister for National Development in respect of private developments on freehold land that are marked and sold as 99-year leasehold properties, what percentage of the residential properties in Singapore do such developments constitute.","Mr Lawrence Wong: As of April 2018, there are about 3,000 private residential units built on freehold and 999-year land but sold on shorter leases. This represents about 0.8% of the total stock of private residential properties in Singapore."
"central developmental authority to support early intervention sector to improve coordination, collaboration and resource allocation","Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) whether a central developmental authority should be set up to support the early intervention sector to improve coordination, collaboration and resource allocation; and (b) whether there are plans to train mainstream preschool teachers to work with children with special needs.","Mr Desmond Lee: The Disability Office within the Ministry of Social and Family Development coordinates the planning, development, resourcing and service delivery of programmes for persons with disabilities, including Early Intervention services. The Disability Office works closely with the hospitals, polyclinics and preschools, for the timely detection of children with developmental needs. The Office also works closely with the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA), SG Enable, Voluntary Welfare Organisation (VWO) providers of early intervention services, and with preschools to provide early intervention services to children with developmental needs, and caregiver training for their families. The Ministry also oversees service management for early intervention services to ensure that service standards are met. It also works with key partners, including the National Council of Social Service and Institutes of Higher Learning, to support the early intervention sector through coordinating manpower planning, capability development for early intervention professionals and setting salary guidelines.All early childhood educators are trained in the development milestones of young children. As part of their pre-service training, they are also introduced to various forms of special needs in young children, including cognitive, behavioural, emotional and sensory characteristics. They are also briefed on the availability of community resources and professionals that provide support for these children.In line with their training, early childhood educators who notice a child falling behind his/her development milestones will advise parents to bring the child to a Polyclinic or GP for referral to KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH) or to the National University Hospital (NUH) Child Development Programme for further assessment.ECDA has also worked with educational institutes and training providers to offer Continuing Professional Development modular courses to existing early childhood educators to be equipped with further skills to better support children with a range of developmental needs.  In addition, early childhood educators may take up the Advanced Diploma in Early Childhood Intervention (Special Needs) or the Specialist Diploma in Early Childhood Learning Support at National Institute of Early Childhood Development campus to gain specialised knowledge and skills to identify and work with children with additional needs. The Specialist Diploma will allow early childhood educators to become Learning Support Educators (LSEds), who are able to identify children with developmental needs in relation to their peers, and to deliver the appropriate intervention in the preschool setting, also known as the Learning Support (LS) and Development Support (DS) programmes. LS and DS are Government-funded early intervention programmes for children with mild developmental needs and provide targeted short-term support through LSEds and therapists in the preschools. LSEds also collaborate with the main early childhood educators of the classes in preschools to adapt teaching methods and activities to better engage children with mild development needs in the classroom. This is critical in sustaining the progress made by the child after the interventions. Over the next four years, MSF will expand LS and DS to more preschools and build up a pool of 200 LSEds to provide targeted intervention and learning support for children with developmental needs in preschools. This will support more early childhood educators in the care and education for their children."
scams deceiving businesses into signing contracts with companies purporting to be authorised government agencies or authorised company registrars,Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for Finance how can the Government better assist or advise businesses which have been deceived or misled into signing contracts with companies purporting to be authorised Government agencies or authorised company registrars.,"Mr Heng Swee Keat: The Government takes a firm stand against any company that impersonates a government agency or an authorised company registrar. In Singapore's context, the authorised company registrar is the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA). ACRA is the statutory body responsible for the registration of companies and businesses in Singapore, and will not hesitate to investigate suspected breaches and prosecute offenders.There are safeguards against a company that tries to pass off as a government entity. Companies and other business entities are required to state their name and registration number in all business correspondences, so that members of the public know the identity of the business entity that they are interacting with. ACRA takes any breach of this requirement seriously. Such a breach can be liable for a fine of up to S$1,000. In the past six years, ACRA has, upon receiving complaints, investigated seven business entities for failing to properly state their name and/or registration number.To protect themselves, businesses are reminded to exercise vigilance when dealing with any unsolicited letter or email from companies purporting to be authorised Government agencies or authorised company registrars. Letters from government agencies have distinct letterheads, with their names and logos. When in doubt, businesses should contact the government agency. They can use the free business entity search function on ACRA's website to verify the identity of the entity they are dealing with. Businesses should peruse carefully all the terms and conditions before entering into any form of agreement.ACRA, in collaboration with the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE), has an online guide for consumers, which includes a checklist on what consumers should watch out for before making business decisions and how they can use ACRA's business information services to conduct background checks on business entities. This guide, available on ACRA's website, includes advice on how to distinguish if the correspondences are from businesses or government agencies.Businesses and consumers should alert ACRA if there are any suspected wrongdoings or misrepresentations by companies purporting to be authorised Government agencies or authorised company registrars. They should also make a police report.In short, be alert, check and if necessary, report."
update on progress of conversion to digital tv,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) what is the current progress of the conversion to digital TV; and (b) what are the plans to increase awareness and hasten the conversion.,"Mr S Iswaran: Today about four in five1 Singaporean households are receiving DTV either over the air or through their Pay TV subscription. The Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) is reaching out to the remaining households to get them DTV-ready before analogue TV signals are switched off on 31 December 2018. In April this year, IMDA launched the DTV Starter Kit to encourage more households to be DTV-ready. The DTV Starter Kit allows Singaporean HDB households without a Pay TV subscription to redeem an indoor DTV antenna and digital set-top box with free installation, or enjoy $100 off selected DTV equipment at participating electronics stores. As of 31 Aug 2018, more than 207,000 households have redeemed their DTV Starter Kits. I encourage all households who have not yet redeemed their DTV Starter Kits to do so right away.IMDA has also been working closely with community partners like the People's Association, the Silver Generation Office and Voluntary Welfare Organisations to help households become DTV-ready. This includes organising roadshows in every town, deploying service counters in high-traffic areas such as markets, hawker centres and community clubs, and conducting briefings at community events. Since June, Mediacorp has also run on-screen crawlers to inform those who are still viewing analogue channels to switch to DTV. Mediacorp will soon reduce the size of the screen area displaying content on analogue channels, which we hope will remind viewers to switch over to DTV early."
monitoring amounts of microbeads in water resources,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether the Ministry monitors the amounts of microbeads in reservoirs, tap water, and discharge into the ocean; (b) what percentage of microbeads is removed during the water treatment process; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider banning cosmetics that contain microbeads.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: PUB has in place a comprehensive water quality monitoring programme to ensure that our potable water supply complies with regulations and international standards, and is safe for drinking. Microplastics, which include microbeads, are removed at our waterworks that treat water for potable supply. At our NEWater and desalination plants, microplastics are removed using reverse osmosis membranes. Monitoring by PUB shows that our drinking water is free from microplastics.  PUB also ensures that all used water is collected and treated at water reclamation plants to internationally recognised discharge standards. During the treatment process, microplastics in used water will be substantially removed as sludge and incinerated. The bulk of the treated used water is further processed and reclaimed as NEWater. As a result of these processes, only a miniscule amount of microplastics is discharged into the sea. Nevertheless, PUB is looking into incorporating membrane bioreactor technology in our used water treatment process to further improve the microplastics removal rate.We are monitoring international developments on microplastics, including microbeads in cosmetics. The National Environment Agency encourages businesses to reduce the use of microbeads in their products. Multinational corporations, such as Johnson & Johnson, Unilever, L'Oreal Group, Colgate-Palmolive, and Estee Lauder Company, have voluntarily phased out microbeads in their products. Major local retailers such as Guardian Singapore, Watsons and NTUC Fairprice, have also indicated that they have phased out microbeads in their house-brand products.We are committed to keeping our watercourses free from pollution, and will continue to review the effectiveness of our regulatory and monitoring regime in safeguarding our water resources and the environment."
adequacy of exposure to mother tongues in kindergarten curriculum,Mr Chong Kee Hiong asked the Minister for Education (a) whether the Ministry will review our kindergarten curriculum to evaluate if the exposure to mother tongues among our young is adequate; and (b) what measures will be introduced to strengthen their foundation in these increasingly important languages.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: MOE, in consultation with early childhood educators as well as local and international experts, has developed the Nurturing Early Learners (NEL) Framework and Educators’ Guides for Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) to support education for pre-school children. The Framework articulates a broad set of vision, objectives, guiding principles and learning goals, including enabling children to learn and use MTL.  Today, MOE Kindergartens offer all three MTLs. Every day, one hour of lesson time is dedicated to MTL. This has not been adopted by all pre-schools but more will expand their offering of MTLs in the coming few years. Beyond classroom exposure, the MTL Promotion Committees and Lee Kuan Yew Fund for Bilingualism have also supported various programmes to encourage MTL use at home and in everyday setting. These efforts, together with the support of community and parents, will provide a conducive environment for our children to learn MTL. "
coordinating body for road resurfacing work,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether road resurfacing work is on a scheduled or condition basis; (b) whether there is a prescribed standard on the quality of road resurfacing work; and (c) whether there is central coordination to minimise repeated road surfacing work along the same road over a short period of time.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The Land Transport Authority (LTA) regularly inspects our roads to ensure their serviceability, and will resurface roads if their surfaces are found to be in poor condition. Road resurfacing may also be required on an ad-hoc basis to repair damage caused by accidents, or to rectify defects such as potholes that require immediate rectification. Finally, road resurfacing is also required after utility laying works are conducted. LTA adheres to international standards when resurfacing roads, such as the International Roughness Index which measures the riding quality of roads.The Road Opening Coordination Committee (ROCC), which is chaired by LTA, centrally coordinates all road resurfacing works among different agencies to minimise repeated road resurfacing works along the same road over a short period of time."
coordinating body for organisation of all mass sports activities,"Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth whether there can be a co-ordinating body for the organisation of all mass sports activities to ensure that organisers do not create traffic shutdown for residents and that there be no loud music being played in the middle of the night.","Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: There is close coordination among Government agencies to assess requests involving mass sports activities. For those requiring road closures or traffic diversion, the event organisers have to submit plans for approval by the Traffic Police and the Land Transport Authority, and will also have to obtain a letter of support from Sport Singapore. Organisers are also required to engage affected stakeholders, such as residents and businesses, and advise them of the road closure timings and alternative vehicular access to the area.  MCCY notes the Member's suggestion for a coordinating body for the organisation of mass sports activities, and will be engaging him to study this suggestion."
enforced physical exercises or physical drills as punishment for disciplinary infringements by servicemen in saf,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Defence (a) whether physical punishments of servicemen by way of enforced physical exercises or physical drills for disciplinary infringements are still allowed in the SAF; and (b) if not, when have such punishments been prohibited in the SAF.","Dr Ng Eng Hen: Physical exercises in the form of push-ups and sit-ups, or foot drills, and non-physical punishment such as additional duties and weekend confinements, can be meted out by SAF commanders as disciplinary measures to soldiers for their disorderly behaviour and improper attire. These forms of discipline are strictly prescribed in the SAF's Joint Manpower Directive which states the number of repetitions that are allowed for specific exercises, the number and duration of additional duties or confinement and the seniority of the commander who are allowed to mete out such disciplinary measures.  SAF personnel who mete out unauthorised punishments, or have wilfully or negligently infringed training safety regulations in the conduct of punishment, have been dealt with and prosecuted within the SAF or criminal prosecution in the State Courts."
"statistics on number of e-mobility devices registered, violations committed and offenders charged","Mr Ang Wei Neng asked the Minister for Transport whether he can provide an update on the registration of e-bicycles, e-scooters and other power-assisted personal mobility devices in terms of (i) the number registered (ii) the number of violations and (iii) the number of offenders charged.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: About 13,300 power-assisted bicycles (PABs) have been registered so far. The registration regime for PABs commenced in August 2017. We will implement a registration regime for e-scooters early next year. Other types of personal mobility devices (PMDs), such as hoverboards and unicycles, will not be subjected to the registration regime as their usage is less widespread and their speeds are lower when used.  Since the start of the year, there were about 650 offences involving PABs including the use of non-compliant PABs. After the Active Mobility Act commenced on 1 May 2018, which provided for enforcement powers, there were over 700 offences involving PMDs, including the use of non-compliant PMDs and speeding offences. LTA does not have records on the number of offenders charged."
update on progress of industry transformation maps for precision engineering industry and electronics industry,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Trade and Industry what has been the progress on the precision engineering industry transformation map and the electronics industry transformation map since their launch in 2017.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: The Precision Engineering Industry Transformation Map (ITM) and the Electronics ITM were launched in October 2016 and September 2017 respectively. Both ITMs were developed and are being implemented in close collaboration with industry, unions, institutes of higher learning (IHLs), and trade associations and chambers, such as the Singapore Precision Engineering & Technology Association (SPETA) and the Singapore Semiconductor Industry Association (SSIA). The Economic Development Board (EDB) is the lead government agency coordinating both ITMs. Both ITMs aim to transform their industries by strengthening existing growth sub-sectors, diversifying into new growth opportunities, and deepening the capabilities of our Precision Engineering and Electronics companies. The Precision Engineering industry is characterised by a large number of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). To help these SMEs grow, we will need to lower their barriers to innovation and technology adoption. One specific initiative aimed at doing so is the development of model factories, which allow SMEs to experience and experiment with advanced manufacturing technologies in a real-life production environment, before deciding whether to implement them in their own premises. As part of the Precision Engineering ITM, the Model Factory @ SIMTech was launched in October 2017. Another Model Factory will be launched by the end of this year. For the Electronics ITM, one area of focus is strengthening our innovation eco-system to enable our companies to harness new growth opportunities. The ITM has outlined a few strategies that are being implemented, such as fostering ""one-to-one"" collaborations between multi-national companies (MNCs) and SMEs, and building up structures to groom Electronics SMEs and startups. Since the launch of the ITM, EDB has worked with Enterprise Singapore (ESG) to support and grow more than fifteen Electronics startups through accelerators and incubators. ESG also supported seven startups in featuring their solutions at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2018 in Las Vegas. As we shift the Precision Engineering and Electronics industries towards higher value-added and innovation-intensive activities, both industries will also see the creation of jobs that require greater depth of knowledge. EDB has worked with SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG), unions and industry stakeholders to roll out Skills Frameworks to help our people identify the key skills, competencies and training programmes that they will need to capitalise on new job opportunities and advance in their careers. We have also put in place programmes to attract young talent, and support the leadership development of our people. For example, with the support of EDB, the SSIA launched the Semiconductor Leadership Accelerator in October 2017 and has since trained about 40 Singaporean professionals over the course of two runs. In addition to the ITM initiatives, EDB has worked with TÜV SÜD to develop the Singapore Smart Industry Readiness Index, a comprehensive tool to help companies identify challenges in adopting Industry 4.0 technology. EDB, in partnership with six trade associations and ESG, has targeted 300 funded assessments of the Index. To date, more than 170 funded assessments have been awarded, and of which 40% were to SMEs. More than a third of the assessments were awarded to Precision Engineering and Electronics companies. Industry feedback has been positive, with several companies sharing their experience at industry seminars.Thus far, the Precision Engineering and Electronics ITMs, as ""live"" roadmaps of transformation, are supporting our companies in harnessing advanced manufacturing technologies, and our people through skills deepening and upgrading efforts. The ITMs will be reviewed continually to take into account industry feedback and prevailing economic conditions. We will continue to work with our tripartite partners in this joint transformation journey. "
participation in skillsfuture leadership development initiative and asean leadership programme,"Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) how many Singaporean workers have participated in the SkillsFuture Leadership Development Initiative and ASEAN Leadership Programme respectively; (b) what industries are these workers employed in at the time of participation; (c) what is the profile of these workers (age, gender, profession and years of work experience); and (d) how many of these workers have progressed into higher-value job roles or leadership roles as a result of participating in the SkillsFuture Leadership Development Initiative and ASEAN Leadership Programme.","Mr Chan Chun Sing: The SkillsFuture Leadership Development Initiative (LDI) aims to develop more Singaporeans as business leaders in their respective fields. This is achieved in two ways. First, LDI supports companies’ efforts to provide promising employees with on-the-job leadership opportunities. Second, LDI supports training providers to develop market- and sector-specific leadership programmes. To-date, companies have committed to develop about 450 Singaporeans under LDI. The scheme is designed to address leadership development needs across different industries and career stages. Accordingly, participants come from diverse industries, including Electronics, Biomedical Sciences and Consumer Businesses, just to name a few. They also have a wide range of professional experience, from the entry level to more advanced stages of their career. Participants are identified by their companies based on merit and performance, regardless of age or gender. So we do not track these statistics.In addition to company-centric programmes, another 80 Singaporeans have completed LDI programmes which focus on sectors and markets, such as the Singapore Semiconductor Leadership Accelerator Programme and the Asian Retail Leaders Programme. There are more cohorts in the pipeline. In particular, the ASEAN Leadership Programme is a new initiative that seeks to help business leaders better understand emerging markets, build networks, and advance their companies' growth throughout South-East Asia. This will help develop Singapore leaders with the necessary expertise in ASEAN markets to operate confidently in the region. The inaugural run of the Programme will be in September this year, with a projected class size of 20 participants. Strong business leaders are critical to a company's success and viability. They are also important to our economy as a whole. We need leaders with vision, know-how and a ""can-do"" spirit to build and grow globally competitive businesses. The Government will continue partnering industry to help more Singaporeans realise their full potential as effective leaders. As to LDI and the ASEAN Leadership Programme specifically, these initiatives are still in their early stages. We have received good feedback so far. LDI participants have affirmed that such programmes are important to their development, and provide them with useful networking opportunities and industry insights. We will continue to engage employers and participants to assess the effectiveness of these programmes and make improvements along the way."
amount spent by hdb in upgrading programme for homeowners in 2017 compared to 2007,Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked the Minister for National Development (a) how much has HDB spent in its upgrading programme for home owners in 2017 as compared to 2007; (b) how many home owners benefited from the upgrading works; and (c) how have these works translated to enhancing the value of the flats.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The estimated expenditure spent in FY2017 on all HDB upgrading programmes was about $590 million. In FY2007, the total amount spent was about $580 million. If we look at just the Main Upgrading Programme (MUP) and the Home Improvement Programme (HIP) alone, about 253,000 flats have benefited from the upgrading works so far, out of a total of 450,000 eligible flats built up to 1986. Another 230,000 flats will benefit from the extension of HIP to cover the flats built between 1987 and 1997.  Upgrading works enhance the value of the flat in several ways, depending on the type of upgrading work. Under programmes such as the Lift Upgrading Programme and the Remaking our Heartland Programme, the Government builds new amenities which improve the living environment, and result in more convenience to residents and added vibrancy to the area. As for programmes such as the HIP, the Government heavily subsidises the works to help resolve common maintenance problems of aging flats. By keeping the flats in good condition, HIP helps flats maintain their value even as they age. Without HIP, potential buyers of older flats and flat owners would have to undertake the works themselves, which can cost up to about $25,000 per flat."

Industry feedback has been positive, with several companies sharing their experience at industry seminars.Thus far, the Precision Engineering and Electronics ITMs, as ""live"" roadmaps of transformation, are supporting our companies in harnessing advanced manufacturing technologies, and our people through skills deepening and upgrading efforts. The ITMs will be reviewed continually to take into account industry feedback and prevailing economic conditions. We will continue to work with our tripartite partners in this joint transformation journey. "
participation in skillsfuture leadership development initiative and asean leadership programme,"Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) how many Singaporean workers have participated in the SkillsFuture Leadership Development Initiative and ASEAN Leadership Programme respectively; (b) what industries are these workers employed in at the time of participation; (c) what is the profile of these workers (age, gender, profession and years of work experience); and (d) how many of these workers have progressed into higher-value job roles or leadership roles as a result of participating in the SkillsFuture Leadership Development Initiative and ASEAN Leadership Programme.","Mr Chan Chun Sing: The SkillsFuture Leadership Development Initiative (LDI) aims to develop more Singaporeans as business leaders in their respective fields. This is achieved in two ways. First, LDI supports companies’ efforts to provide promising employees with on-the-job leadership opportunities. Second, LDI supports training providers to develop market- and sector-specific leadership programmes. To-date, companies have committed to develop about 450 Singaporeans under LDI. The scheme is designed to address leadership development needs across different industries and career stages. Accordingly, participants come from diverse industries, including Electronics, Biomedical Sciences and Consumer Businesses, just to name a few. They also have a wide range of professional experience, from the entry level to more advanced stages of their career. Participants are identified by their companies based on merit and performance, regardless of age or gender. So we do not track these statistics.In addition to company-centric programmes, another 80 Singaporeans have completed LDI programmes which focus on sectors and markets, such as the Singapore Semiconductor Leadership Accelerator Programme and the Asian Retail Leaders Programme. There are more cohorts in the pipeline. In particular, the ASEAN Leadership Programme is a new initiative that seeks to help business leaders better understand emerging markets, build networks, and advance their companies' growth throughout South-East Asia. This will help develop Singapore leaders with the necessary expertise in ASEAN markets to operate confidently in the region. The inaugural run of the Programme will be in September this year, with a projected class size of 20 participants. Strong business leaders are critical to a company's success and viability. They are also important to our economy as a whole. We need leaders with vision, know-how and a ""can-do"" spirit to build and grow globally competitive businesses. The Government will continue partnering industry to help more Singaporeans realise their full potential as effective leaders. As to LDI and the ASEAN Leadership Programme specifically, these initiatives are still in their early stages. We have received good feedback so far. LDI participants have affirmed that such programmes are important to their development, and provide them with useful networking opportunities and industry insights. We will continue to engage employers and participants to assess the effectiveness of these programmes and make improvements along the way."
lowering cost burden to hawker centre tenants and stallholders from implementation of e-payments and other measures,"Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether NEA can lower the cost burden passed to hawker centre tenants and stallholders such as that in the implementation of one-stop payment terminals, electronic cashless payments, tray returns, dishwashing, and general cleaning.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The primary objective of hawker centres is to provide hygienic and affordable food. The Government has invested in helping stallholders make a decent living and preparing them for future challenges, such as increased manpower shortage and rising labour costs.The implementation of centre-level productivity initiatives, such as Centralised Dishwashing and Automated Tray Return Systems, will enhance productivity in our hawker centres. It will also reduce the hawkers' workload while addressing their manpower constraints. As labour costs are expected to increase in future, the productivity savings from these initiatives will translate into cost savings for the stallholders.To help lower the initial cost burden, the Government is co-funding up to 70% of the operating costs of these initiatives for two years. This has been well-received in the hawker centres which have come on board our Productive Hawker Centres initiative, where more than 90% of the stallholders have adopted Centralised Dishwashing services. With these services, stallholders no longer need to collect and wash crockery or employ someone to do so. Stallholders also do not have to buy their own crockery as these are provided by the Centralised Dishwashing vendor.In October last year, NEA launched the Hawkers' Productivity Grant that provides funding support for the purchase of kitchen automation equipment. This also helps to increase our hawkers' productivity and reduce their workload. Stallholders can claim 80% of the qualifying cost of the equipment on a reimbursement basis, up to a total of $5,000 within a three-year time frame. As of 31 August 2018, NEA has approved 170 applications. In the same vein, the Government called a Call-for-Collaboration (CFC) for the provision of e-payment solutions for food businesses in April 2018. This will reduce the costs to hawkers who wish to adopt the option of electronic cashless payments to increase productivity. For cleaning, NEA adopts procurement best practices to maximise value for money. These include open tenders to facilitate price competition, and demand-aggregation to bring down unit costs. NEA also adopts a price-quality model which balances between costs and service standards to stall-holders.We will continue to monitor the costs to stallholders closely and, where necessary, review the measures to help our stallholders better manage their business costs."
transition of early childhood educators from other kindergartens and childcare centres to moe kindergartens,Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for Social and Family Development in light of more MOE Kindergartens (MKs) being set up (a) how will the transition of early childhood educators from other kindergartens and childcare centres be managed to ensure a seamless shift to the new work environment or employer; (b) whether there have been many enquiries and applications from existing educators to join the MKs; and (c) whether there is re-skilling required for affected teaching staff whose kindergartens are impacted by the emergence of MKs and who have not been successful in transiting to the MK environment or employment.,"Mr Desmond Lee:  With more dual-income families and working grandparents, as well as growing awareness of the importance of early childhood development, there has been a rising demand for preschool services in Singapore. To meet this demand, over 30 percent more or 40,000 new preschool places will be provided by 2023.The expansion of MOE Kindergartens, which cater to children aged five to six, is only one part of this effort to provide for more affordable and quality early childhood services. Selected MOE Kindergartens partner with Anchor Operators, which run Early Years Centres catering to children aged four and below. The sector remains open to other operators, who continue to play an important role in meeting the demand for preschool services and the different needs of parents and children.In this context, the demand for early childhood educators for the entire sector, and not just the MOE Kindergartens, will continue to grow. For this reason, the Early Childhood Diploma intake at polytechnics has almost doubled from 380 places in 2015 to 727 places in 2017. The Early Childhood Development Agency (or ECDA) will work with the new National Institute of Early Childhood Development to ensure a sufficient pipeline of qualified early childhood educators for the entire sector.ECDA requires the same professional qualifications for early childhood educators, regardless of the preschool they work in. Hence, existing early childhood educators who have taken up employment at the MOE kindergartens would have similar skillsets needed to succeed in their new environment. To supplement their professional training, operators generally have their own on-boarding and induction programmes for new staff to smoothen the transition for them into the workplace. In the case of MOE Kindergartens, headquarter and centre-level induction programmes have helped incoming MOE Kindergarten teachers adjust well to their new working environment.Given the growth and transformation of the sector, Early Childhood educators today have a wide array of options for their career development. We will continue to encourage all early childhood educators to deepen their competencies through continuing development opportunities and milestone programmes for the sector. This not only helps them to keep current with professional requirements and developments in the early childhood field, but also enhances their chances to teach in the centres of their choice. Overall, the quality of the sector will rise."
minimum standards for providers of home-based and centre-based services for elderly care,Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked the Minister for Health what measures will be implemented to ensure that (i) providers of home-based and centre-based services for elderly care meet minimum standards of quality (ii) professionals and staff are adequately trained and certified and (iii) this employment sector has a strong Singaporean core.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Ministry of Health (MOH) takes a developmental approach to ensure the provision of good quality home- and centre-based care services. In 2015, MOH, in consultation with the sector, introduced developmental service guidelines for home- and centre-based care providers covering areas such as care delivery, staff training and staff qualifications. Separately, healthcare professionals in the sector, such as doctors, nurses and therapists, are subject to licensing by their respective professional bodies, and are held to strict professional standards in areas such as code of conduct, practice standards and competencies. Eldercare centres receiving MOH funding are also required to pass service audits. To continually raise standards and improve quality of care, the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) conducts regular capability-building programmes in areas such as infection control and medication management, and holds sector forums to regularly share good practices. AIC also provides funding support to providers for staff development.  MOH will review the need for more formal regulation, including licensing under the upcoming Healthcare Services Act. The Act is scheduled to be rolled out in 2020. As the sector is still nascent and evolving, we will adopt a risk-based approach and subject services with higher patient risks to higher levels of regulation, so as not to add excessive regulatory burden to providers, which could consequently raise the cost of care for seniors. We recognise the importance of building a strong Singaporean core to support the growth of home and centre based services. In fact, locals comprise more than seven out of 10 of the workforce in the sector as at end 2017. MOH has provided funding to providers to raise salaries, and this had led to an increase in local staff salaries by around 30% across providers which tapped on our funding support from 2012 to 2017. We agree that better recognition of the importance of care workers will help to encourage more Singaporeans to step forward to join this sector, and we will continue our efforts to reach out to the society at large. "
review of relevant literature text for lower secondary classes with global pivot to asia,Mr Chong Kee Hiong asked the Minister for Education (a) whether the Ministry will be considering a review of relevant literature texts for lower secondary classes in view of the global pivot to Asia; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider exposing our students to excerpts from great Asian literature classics such as the Romance of the Three Kingdoms.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: MOE has been reviewing and will continue to regularly review Literature texts. We do so based on educational objectives: the literary merit of the texts, their accessibility and age-appropriateness of language and themes, and their relevance to today’s context.So for Literature in English, a text list for secondary school students is provided and updated every three years. This list comprises texts from Singapore, our region and other parts of the world. Given Singapore's position as a nation in Southeast Asia and a global city connected to the rest of the world, MOE needs to ensure a sufficiently wide range of texts, to allow students to be exposed to different cultures, beliefs and practices. Schools have a choice when it comes to selecting texts that best meet the needs of their students. At the lower secondary, they may choose from the recommended text list or select their own Literature texts.  In recent years, there has been a greater emphasis on texts from Singapore and the region. I think this is reflective of the point in history we are living in.  Beyond Literature, students are also exposed to texts as part of language learning. For the Mother Tongue Languages, adapted excerpts from suitable classics have been included in the textbooks. For Chinese Language, these include short stories extracted from Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and selected poetry from the Tang Dynasty. Similarly, poetry and excerpts from ancient classics such as Sejarah Melayu (The Malay Annals), Panji Tales, Thirukural and Naladiyar are adapted and included in the Malay and Tamil Language textbooks."
appropriate security assessment measures in place for screening of cybersecurity staff and contractors,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Communications and Information whether the Government will put in place appropriate security assessment measures for cybersecurity staff or contractors working with the civil service, statutory boards, banks and other organisations or businesses, who are foreigners, employment pass holders, Singapore PRs or new citizens, including those originating from the country that is linked to the Advance Persistent Threat group who carried out the recent cyberattack against SingHealth, NUS and NTU.","Mr S Iswaran: All public service staff and contractors dealing with Government cybersecurity matters, who require access to classified Government information, must undergo security screening by the authorities. Similarly, organisations in the Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) sectors such as Banking and Finance as well as Land Transport are required by their respective sectoral regulators to screen all staff and contractors with access to key infrastructure such as IT systems. Such measures go some way to mitigating the ‘insider’ risk, though they are not fool-proof.The Cyber Security Agency (CSA) will also license organisations offering penetration testing and managed security operations centre monitoring services as well as individuals directly engaged for such services, to ensure they meet certain criteria including that their key executive officers are fit and proper persons. Under the Cybersecurity Code of Practice issued by CSA, all CII owners must calibrate a vendor’s access to their CII, based on their organisations’ business needs and cybersecurity risk profile."
plans to encourage singaporeans to have more children,Mr Alex Yam asked the Prime Minister (a) what plans are being considered to encourage Singaporeans to have more children in light of the 2017 birth rates being at a seven-year low; and (b) whether the Government has studied the main reasons leading to (i) later marriages (ii) later age for first child and (iii) smaller families.,"Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): Singapore's total fertility rate (TFR) had been around 1.2 in recent years, but fell to 1.16 in 2017. This fall in TFR is in part due to a demographic shift in our population. A relatively large cohort of young Singaporeans, many of whom are children of the ""baby boomers"" born between 1988 and 1998, are just entering the peak childbearing ages between the ages of 25 and 39. For birth and population trends, beyond yearly variations, it is useful to look at longer time periods. In the last five years since 2013, which was when the oldest cohort of ""echo baby boomers"" first turned 25 years old, we have seen a slight uptick in the average number of births compared to the preceding five-year period (from 2008 to 2012).1 At the same time, compared to earlier cohorts, many of these ""echo baby boomers"" are not yet married or have not yet started having children. When this cohort starts having children, and as the younger ""echo baby boomers"" (currently aged between 20 and 24 years) enter their peak childbearing years, we are hopeful that the number of births will increase. Our TFR could correspondingly improve. While our birth rates have fallen, it is encouraging that the number of resident marriages has risen – from 25,927 in 2016 to 26,348 in 2017, higher than the average of the past decade of about 25,000 resident marriages. The increase in marriages could translate to more births in the coming years, as young couples build their families. Indeed, our surveys show that Singaporeans' aspirations to get married and have children remain strong. The 2016 Marriage and Parenthood (M&P) Survey indicated that more than 8 in 10 (83%) of single Millennials (aged 21-35) want to get married, and more than 9 in 10 (92%) of married Millennials want at least two children. However, young Singaporeans have other life goals as well. With better education and career opportunities, some decide to delay marriage and starting a family, in order to first fulfil other aspirations. From the same survey, half of the single Millennials (54%) indicated that they wanted to focus on their career and studies before marrying. These factors have contributed to the trends highlighted by Mr Alex Yam, with Singaporeans getting married and having children later, and subsequently having smaller families. From 2006 to 2016, the median age of Singaporean women at first marriage increased from 26.7 to 28.0 years, and the median age of mothers at first birth increased from 29.4 to 30.3 years. Nonetheless, there are other reasons for cheer. A small but growing number of couples in Singapore are choosing to have larger families. 2,118 babies born in 2017 were the fourth or higher birth-order child, the highest in the past five years. Marriage and parenthood are ultimately personal decisions, and the reasons and timing for getting married and having children vary across couples. The Government cannot interfere with people’s personal decisions, but we can and will continue to encourage Singaporeans to get married and have children, and to help them with strong support when they do.We have invested significant resources in the Marriage and Parenthood Package over the past 17 years, to better support Singaporeans at every stage of their marriage and parenthood journey. In line with the feedback we have received, we are doing more in the three key areas of housing, pre-school and workplace support. Housing. Many couples aspire to own their homes before they start a family. To help them, HDB has launched more than 50,000 new BTO flats since 2015, with priority allocation for first-timers. To provide faster access to housing, HDB will launch 1,100 flats with shorter waiting times of 2.5 years in the next few months, and another batch of 2,000 in 2019. HDB has also been more flexible to allow deferment of income assessment for housing loans and grants till before keys collection. This would benefit young couples who are studying or serving National Service, and are ready to settle down earlier in life. Pre-school. Many parents cite finding good caregiving options and financial costs as key concerns when having children. One of our key priorities is to ensure more affordable and quality preschool places, to give parents peace of mind that their children are well taken care of while they are at work. The Government is committed to ensuring that every parent who wants a preschool place for their child will be able to have one. ECDA is enhancing the provision of affordable and quality infant and child care, with 40,000 more places to be added in the next five years. MOE will set up more MOE kindergartens (MKs), with a target of 50 MKs by 2023. As announced by Minister Desmond Lee in July, we are also reviewing our preschool subsidy framework to improve affordability for parents. Work-life support. We recognise that more Singaporeans want to fulfil their career aspirations even as they build their families. We are doing more to support them in managing their work and family responsibilities. In particular, parental leave provisions have been progressively enhanced over the years, including improved leave support for fathers to play a more active role in caring for their children. Last year, we made the second week of Paternity Leave mandatory, and increased Shared Parental Leave from one to four weeks. In total, fathers can now tap on up to eight weeks of leave to care for their children in the first year of birth. Over the past year, we have also launched two Tripartite Standards to encourage more family-friendly workplaces – one on Flexible Work Arrangements, and another on Unpaid Leave for Unexpected Care Needs. To date, about 880 employers have signed up to the Tripartite Standard on Flexible Work Arrangements, and 290 employers to that on Unpaid Leave for Unexpected Care Needs. We have also launched the enhanced Work-Life Grant in July, to better encourage the adoption of flexible work arrangements by employees. We will work with tripartite partners to encourage more companies to adopt the Tripartite Standards and Work-Life Grant, so that they can better support their employees' flexible working needs. It is not enough for Government to act alone. For marriage and parenthood to be achievable, enjoyable and celebrated, the whole of society must come together to foster more family-friendly workplaces and communities. Employers and co-workers can play their part, by showing understanding and support if colleagues need time off to care for young children or aged parents. I was also heartened to hear that the Singapore University of Social Sciences has recently launched a Marriage and Baby Bonus Scheme, that offers each part-time adult student up to two free modules if they get married or have a child during their study. These efforts by the larger community go a long way in celebrating and supporting parenthood. We have just celebrated our 53rd National Day a month ago. With the combined efforts of Government, employers, co-workers and the wider community, we can together make Singapore a Great Place for Families, for many more generations of Singaporeans to come."
new sectors considered for implementation of progressive wage model,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what new sectors are being considered for implementation of the progressive wage model beyond security, cleaning and landscaping sectors; and (b) whether the progressive wage model will be implemented in the eldercare sector.","Mrs Josephine Teo: The Progressive Wage Model (PWM) provides a clear progression pathway for workers to earn higher wages as they become more skilled, more productive and take on higher job responsibilities. PWM has been implemented in the cleaning, security and landscape sectors as a targeted intervention to address low and stagnant wages caused by cheap sourcing. The PWMs in these sectors have led to wage growth for more than 70,000 resident workers. Between 2011 and 2016, the real median gross wages of full-time resident cleaners, security guards and landscape maintenance workers increased by 5.7%, 6.4% and 3% per annum respectively, higher than resident median income growth. Each PWM is developed through extensive tripartite negotiations, taking into consideration sector-specific issues such as past and prevailing wages, working conditions and the required skills for the relevant jobs. The PWMs are also regularly reviewed by the tripartite committees to ensure that they remain relevant and aligned with the sectors' industry transformation goals. The Government continues to work closely with tripartite partners to develop, promote and adopt PWMs in other sectors on a voluntary basis, such as for bus captains and baggage handlers. It was earlier announced that tripartite partners are exploring a PWM for the lift sector to attract more skilled workers into the sector and improve service quality. Discussions are at an advanced stage and more details will be released in the Sectoral Tripartite Committee’s report soon. For the eldercare sector, MOH has provided funding support between 2012 and 2017 to raise wages of workers. Local eldercare workers' salaries of providers that have tapped on this funding have increased by an average of around 30% over this period. MOH also supports skills training scholarships and grants, and productivity improvement and job redesign initiatives, to raise the value of jobs alongside salary increases in line with the intent of the PWM. MOH will continue to work with the employers to review salaries of workers regularly to ensure that they are adequately recognised for their efforts. MOH will study if further efforts are needed, including whether to introduce a PWM for the eldercare sector with tripartite partners. "
percentage of mobile phone ownership by income group,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what is the current percentage of mobile phone ownership for each income group; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider defining basic necessities to include mobile phones when calculating the cost of living, especially in light of the Government's push towards a Smart Nation.","Mr Chan Chun Sing: Based on data from the latest Household Expenditure Survey published by the Department of Statistics, the mobile phone ownership rate is high across all household income groups. For instance, the proportion of resident households with mobile phones ranged from 88.7 per cent for the lowest 20 per cent of households by income to 99.7 per cent for the 61st to 80th percentiles of households by income.1Mobile phones and their related subscription fees and call charges are included in the consumption basket used to compute the Consumer Price Index (CPI-All Items), which in turn is used as a proxy to measure changes in the cost of living of resident households. Between 2012 and 2017, the communications category of CPI-All Items, which largely consists of mobile phones and related services, saw a price decline of 0.2 per cent per annum on average as compared to the 0.6 per cent per annum increase in the overall CPI-All Items. The decline in communications costs faced by households reflects the increasingly vibrant and competitive telecommunications market.More broadly, the Government recognises that mobile phones are an important enabler for many of the digital services that we want to provide to our citizens. Guided by the Digital Readiness Blueprint, the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) is looking into providing support to those who do not have access to such devices. In assisting low-income households with financial difficulties, the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) also includes their communications needs in the ComCare assistance provided."
terms and conditions to protect employees hired as individual contractors in the public sector,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Prime Minister with regard to employees hired as individual contractors by the public sector (a) how many employees does the public service have on such contracts currently; (b) what guidelines are in place to protect the interests of these workers in terms of leave benefits and compensation review; (c) what channels are available to them to seek redress on their grievances; (d) whether there are limits to the duration of such contracts; and (e) when such contractors go on to secure permanent employment in the public sector, whether there are provisions to ensure that their prior contract work counts towards the compensation and grade they obtain.","Mr Chan Chun Sing (for the Prime Minister): The intent of the contract framework is to allow public agencies the flexibility to employ officers to undertake specific projects over a fixed period, or as a means to assess their suitability for the job. As at 31 December 2017, about 10% of all public officers or 14,600 public officers are employed on contracts, excluding those on re-employment contracts. Contract officers generally enjoy the same leave and medical benefits and are paid according to the same salary structure as permanent officers1. Public agencies can appoint officers on contract for up to four years to assess their suitability for the job. For officers who perform well in the job and are assessed to be suitable for a long term career with the Public Service, agencies will offer them permanent positions after one or two years. When contract officers are emplaced as permanent officers, their period of service is considered continuous from the contract employment episode. Agencies also consider the period of contract service when determining the substantive grade and corresponding salary to offer at the point of emplacement. As adopters of the Tripartite Standard on Grievance Handling, public agencies have grievance handling procedures in place for officers, whether contract or permanent, to raise their grievances and for these grievances to be properly investigated and resolved."
recourse available to pedestrians and motorists involved in accidents,Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for Transport (a) what recourse do pedestrians and motorists have in accidents involving (i) private cars that bear only non-commercial use insurance (ii) private-hire vehicles and taxis doing courier service delivery; and (b) what actions will be taken when apps operators conduct themselves in violation of regulations.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The Motor Vehicles (Third Party Risks and Compensation) Act requires all motor vehicles, whether private cars, private-hire cars (PHCs) or taxis, to be insured against third-party claims on injury and death. Drivers must thus ensure that their motor insurance policies provide the appropriate coverage taking into account the intended use of the vehicle. Drivers who contravene this requirement can be fined up to $1,000 and/or be imprisoned for up to 3 months. They may also be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving license for 12 months from the date of conviction. In the event of accidents involving vehicles which do not have the required insurance coverage, the victim may initiate civil proceedings against the other party. In addition, PHCs and taxis are prohibited from being used for the conveyance of goods for reward without LTA's approval. PHC and taxi drivers who accept such jobs may have their vocational licences revoked. PHC booking service operators (BSOs) are required under the Road Traffic Act to ensure that only licensed and appropriately insured drivers and cars are deployed on their platforms. Errant BSOs are liable for warnings, fines, and in egregious cases, a General Suspension Order."
rise in outrage of modesty cases on public transport,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Home Affairs with regard to the rise in outrage of modesty cases on public transport (a) what are the current measures in place to ensure that commuters are able to travel safely and whether they are sufficient; (b) how does the Ministry plan to deal with the rise; (c) whether most cases occur at peak or non-peak hours; and (d) whether the number of male victims has risen.,"Mr K Shanmugam: To deter outrage of modesty (OM), the Police conduct patrols at bus interchanges, train platforms, and on board trains. Police are also working with community volunteers through the Citizen on Patrol (COP) initiative to complement the patrols conducted by the Police. The Police will continue their efforts to educate and raise public awareness of OM. Advisories have been placed at prominent locations in the MRT stations, bus interchanges, on trains and buses. Police officers have been distributing advisories on OM to commuters.We urge victims to make a Police report as soon as possible. Reporting the crime early is crucial to help the Police identify and arrest the perpetrator. OM happens during both peak and off-peak hours, in roughly the same proportion. Hence, we urge commuters to be vigilant at all times. The percentage of OM cases involving male victims has remained relatively low over the past three years. The Police are monitoring the increase in OM cases and will regularly review their measures."
mechanisms to ensure affordability of school bus services to all school-going children,Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for Education what mechanisms have been put in place to ensure school bus services remain affordable to all school-going children.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: Schools select school bus operators through a competitive bidding process and award contracts to transport operators who best meet their needs. In January 2015, MOE enhanced the bidding process for school bus services so that schools can reach out to more bus operators to obtain more competitive offers.  The competitiveness of bus fares proposed is one of the key evaluation factors considered by schools.The Government has put in place a number of measures to help school bus operators keep their operating cost low so that they can offer more competitive bus fares. For example, school buses are exempted from Certificate of Entitlement requirements. Other private bus operators who use their buses to provide school bus services would be given 50% road tax rebate by the Land Transport Authority. To help students who need further assistance to meet their transport expenses, MOE has also implemented a transport subsidy for students on the Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS) since 1 April 2015. MOE subsidises 50% of the actual monthly school bus fares for primary school FAS students who commute to school via school bus.  About 3,600 primary students are currently in receipt of MOE's transport subsidy."
jobs created by new firms in last five years,Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what is the number of jobs which new firms have created in the last five years; (b) how does this number compare to job creation by older firms; and (c) what is the profile and prospects of these new jobs created.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: A study by MTI showed that young firms are key contributors of jobs in Singapore. These are firms which have been formed for five years or less. Between 2012 and 2016, young firms created an average of more than 106,000 jobs per annum, accounting for close to 90 per cent of the 120,000 jobs created each year.  Many of the jobs created by young firms are in sectors that provide good wages and career development prospects for Singaporeans. In particular, around one-third of the 106,000 jobs created by young firms from 2012 to 2016 were in key growth sectors such as wholesale trade, manufacturing, information & communications and finance & insurance. These are sectors which pay higher monthly wages compared to the economy-wide average. The Government will continue to work with industry and other key stakeholders to encourage entrepreneurship and attract new investments into Singapore."
actions against people smugglers,"Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Home Affairs what actions have been, and are being, taken to prosecute people smugglers.","Mr K Shanmugam: We take tough action against people smugglers. Between 2016 and July 2018, eleven persons were charged and successfully prosecuted under the Immigration Act for people smuggling or abetment. They were sentenced to imprisonment terms ranging from six to 30 months, and caning of up to six strokes.  People smuggling is a transnational crime, and so we also work closely with our foreign counterparts through regular information exchanges and law enforcement cooperation."
"central developmental authority to support early intervention sector to improve coordination, collaboration and resource allocation","Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) whether a central developmental authority should be set up to support the early intervention sector to improve coordination, collaboration and resource allocation; and (b) whether there are plans to train mainstream preschool teachers to work with children with special needs.","Mr Desmond Lee: The Disability Office within the Ministry of Social and Family Development coordinates the planning, development, resourcing and service delivery of programmes for persons with disabilities, including Early Intervention services. The Disability Office works closely with the hospitals, polyclinics and preschools, for the timely detection of children with developmental needs. The Office also works closely with the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA), SG Enable, Voluntary Welfare Organisation (VWO) providers of early intervention services, and with preschools to provide early intervention services to children with developmental needs, and caregiver training for their families. The Ministry also oversees service management for early intervention services to ensure that service standards are met. It also works with key partners, including the National Council of Social Service and Institutes of Higher Learning, to support the early intervention sector through coordinating manpower planning, capability development for early intervention professionals and setting salary guidelines.All early childhood educators are trained in the development milestones of young children. As part of their pre-service training, they are also introduced to various forms of special needs in young children, including cognitive, behavioural, emotional and sensory characteristics. They are also briefed on the availability of community resources and professionals that provide support for these children.In line with their training, early childhood educators who notice a child falling behind his/her development milestones will advise parents to bring the child to a Polyclinic or GP for referral to KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH) or to the National University Hospital (NUH) Child Development Programme for further assessment.ECDA has also worked with educational institutes and training providers to offer Continuing Professional Development modular courses to existing early childhood educators to be equipped with further skills to better support children with a range of developmental needs.  In addition, early childhood educators may take up the Advanced Diploma in Early Childhood Intervention (Special Needs) or the Specialist Diploma in Early Childhood Learning Support at National Institute of Early Childhood Development campus to gain specialised knowledge and skills to identify and work with children with additional needs. The Specialist Diploma will allow early childhood educators to become Learning Support Educators (LSEds), who are able to identify children with developmental needs in relation to their peers, and to deliver the appropriate intervention in the preschool setting, also known as the Learning Support (LS) and Development Support (DS) programmes. LS and DS are Government-funded early intervention programmes for children with mild developmental needs and provide targeted short-term support through LSEds and therapists in the preschools. LSEds also collaborate with the main early childhood educators of the classes in preschools to adapt teaching methods and activities to better engage children with mild development needs in the classroom. This is critical in sustaining the progress made by the child after the interventions. Over the next four years, MSF will expand LS and DS to more preschools and build up a pool of 200 LSEds to provide targeted intervention and learning support for children with developmental needs in preschools. This will support more early childhood educators in the care and education for their children."
scams deceiving businesses into signing contracts with companies purporting to be authorised government agencies or authorised company registrars,Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for Finance how can the Government better assist or advise businesses which have been deceived or misled into signing contracts with companies purporting to be authorised Government agencies or authorised company registrars.,"Mr Heng Swee Keat: The Government takes a firm stand against any company that impersonates a government agency or an authorised company registrar. In Singapore's context, the authorised company registrar is the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA). ACRA is the statutory body responsible for the registration of companies and businesses in Singapore, and will not hesitate to investigate suspected breaches and prosecute offenders.There are safeguards against a company that tries to pass off as a government entity. Companies and other business entities are required to state their name and registration number in all business correspondences, so that members of the public know the identity of the business entity that they are interacting with. ACRA takes any breach of this requirement seriously. Such a breach can be liable for a fine of up to S$1,000. In the past six years, ACRA has, upon receiving complaints, investigated seven business entities for failing to properly state their name and/or registration number.To protect themselves, businesses are reminded to exercise vigilance when dealing with any unsolicited letter or email from companies purporting to be authorised Government agencies or authorised company registrars. Letters from government agencies have distinct letterheads, with their names and logos. When in doubt, businesses should contact the government agency. They can use the free business entity search function on ACRA's website to verify the identity of the entity they are dealing with. Businesses should peruse carefully all the terms and conditions before entering into any form of agreement.ACRA, in collaboration with the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE), has an online guide for consumers, which includes a checklist on what consumers should watch out for before making business decisions and how they can use ACRA's business information services to conduct background checks on business entities. This guide, available on ACRA's website, includes advice on how to distinguish if the correspondences are from businesses or government agencies.Businesses and consumers should alert ACRA if there are any suspected wrongdoings or misrepresentations by companies purporting to be authorised Government agencies or authorised company registrars. They should also make a police report.In short, be alert, check and if necessary, report."
update on progress of conversion to digital tv,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) what is the current progress of the conversion to digital TV; and (b) what are the plans to increase awareness and hasten the conversion.,"Mr S Iswaran: Today about four in five1 Singaporean households are receiving DTV either over the air or through their Pay TV subscription. The Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) is reaching out to the remaining households to get them DTV-ready before analogue TV signals are switched off on 31 December 2018. In April this year, IMDA launched the DTV Starter Kit to encourage more households to be DTV-ready. The DTV Starter Kit allows Singaporean HDB households without a Pay TV subscription to redeem an indoor DTV antenna and digital set-top box with free installation, or enjoy $100 off selected DTV equipment at participating electronics stores. As of 31 Aug 2018, more than 207,000 households have redeemed their DTV Starter Kits. I encourage all households who have not yet redeemed their DTV Starter Kits to do so right away.IMDA has also been working closely with community partners like the People's Association, the Silver Generation Office and Voluntary Welfare Organisations to help households become DTV-ready. This includes organising roadshows in every town, deploying service counters in high-traffic areas such as markets, hawker centres and community clubs, and conducting briefings at community events. Since June, Mediacorp has also run on-screen crawlers to inform those who are still viewing analogue channels to switch to DTV. Mediacorp will soon reduce the size of the screen area displaying content on analogue channels, which we hope will remind viewers to switch over to DTV early."
specific period for traffic summons to be issued to driver/offender,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether there is a specific period for a traffic summons to be issued to a driver/offender as in-car evidence or human recall of the incident may be lost after a certain period after the incident.,"Mr K Shanmugam: Traffic Police, Land Transport Authority, Urban Redevelopment Authority and Housing Development Board issue traffic and parking summonses, only when there is strong evidence that the recipient has committed an offence.In cases where the offender is the vehicle owner, he would be notified of the offence within a week. In cases where the offender is not the vehicle owner, he would be notified of the offence within six weeks or so. More time is required, as the agency needs to establish his identity, based on the information provided by the vehicle owner and other relevant facts. The above time norms may not apply, in scenarios where the offence was reported by members of the public without strong accompanying evidence. In such cases, the relevant agency will conduct an investigation to establish the facts of the case."
tweaking bus services within boon lay place and jurong west to better serve residents,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Minister for Transport whether a re-route of existing bus services or additional stops for certain hours or a new bus loop service which ply through Boon Lay Place and the Jurong West parts of Boon Lay constituency can be introduced so that residents living in the Jurong West side of Boon Lay can commute to Boon Lay Place (where most of the community facilities are located) more conveniently and vice versa.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Currently, commuters can travel between Boon Lay Place and Jurong West via a direct public bus service, that is, Service 99 or within one bus transfer. As the area is adequately served by existing bus services, there are no plans to roll out new services or to amend existing services. LTA has to be mindful that many commuters could be negatively affected if existing bus services are amended."
"measures to deal with personal mobility devices and vehicle users blaring loud music or sounds in public areas, pathways and roads","Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Transport whether measures can be introduced to deal with personal mobility devices and vehicle users who blare loud music or sounds thereby causing annoyance whilst travelling in or along public areas, pathways and roads.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: LTA encourages all users of personal mobility devices and vehicle drivers to be considerate and gracious to others. As individuals, we should also be prepared to advise and nudge one another against ungracious behaviours."
what hdb flat owners should do at different life stages to ensure a home for life and adequate nest-egg for retirement,"Mr Alex Yam asked the Minister for National Development in light of the various new initiatives on public housing, whether the Ministry can clarify what HDB flat owners at different life stages should do to ensure that they will have a home for life and also an adequate nest-egg for retirement.","Mr Lawrence Wong: The Government has put in place strong support for Singaporeans to meet their housing needs across different life stages.We are committed to helping young Singaporeans own their homes, just like previous generations of Singaporeans. We will ensure HDB flats are kept affordable for first-timers, by selling them at subsidised prices and providing generous housing grants.  In this way, Singaporeans will continue to have a tangible stake in the nation’s progress, and their housing asset will appreciate as the economy grows.  With evolving life circumstances, some families may subsequently choose to move to a larger flat, or near their parents or children for mutual care and support. They should be in a good position to do so, as they would have enjoyed some appreciation from their first flat. We also have schemes to help them live near their parents or married children, such as the Proximity Housing Grant, which was enhanced earlier this year.  For seniors, the HDB flat provides a nest-egg for retirement. The Government is committed to providing home owners with many options to unlock the value of the flats for their retirement needs. For example, seniors can rent out a spare bedroom or right-size to a smaller flat and apply for the Silver Housing Bonus. They can also sell part of their lease to HDB under the Lease Buyback Scheme (LBS). We recently announced the extension of LBS to five-room and larger flats so that more Singaporeans can benefit from the scheme. Government upgrading programmes will also help to maintain the value of the HDB flats, and ensure they remain safe and liveable through their lifespan. We will implement the Home Improvement Programme for the next batch of flats built between 1987 and 1997; and will undertake a second round of HIP upgrading for HDB flats when they are about 60 to 70 years old.  The Government has announced ambitious housing plans for the next few decades. Singaporeans can do their part too, by planning ahead and making informed housing choices. Working together, we can continue to strengthen public housing and home ownership for current and future generations of Singaporeans."
regulation of careshield life under insurance act to protect premiums collected and payouts claimed,"Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry asked the Minister for Health (a) whether Careshield Life is subjected to the Insurance Act; and (b) if not, how will the Government ensure that the premiums collected are properly managed and payouts made available when claims arise."," Mr Gan Kim Yong: CareShield Life will not be subject to the Insurance Act as it will be administered by the Government. However, the Government will ensure that CareShield Life is managed in line with relevant regulatory requirements that MAS sets for private insurance companies, including measures to ensure solvency. This is similar to how the MediShield Life scheme is managed today.To ensure the proper governance of premiums collected for CareShield Life, the Government intends to enact new legislation for CareShield Life in 2019. The new CareShield Life legislation will provide for the setting up of a CareShield Life Fund. All CareShield Life premiums collected, along with any investment returns from these premiums, will remain entirely within the Fund. The Fund will be used solely for the benefit of policyholders. It will be audited annually and the financial accounts made public to ensure that all the monies are accounted for. In addition, the Government also intends to legislate the setting up of an independent Council to provide advice on the administration of the CareShield Life scheme. The Council will regularly review and recommend changes in premiums and payouts, in accordance with an actuarially sound adjustment framework. If claims are higher than projected, the Council could recommend raising premiums or slowing down payout increases. Conversely, if claims are lower than expected, the Council could recommend payout increases, slower premium increases, or to return surpluses to policyholders as premium rebates. This legislated arrangement will help safeguard the long-term sustainability of the Fund."
amount spent by hdb in upgrading programme for homeowners in 2017 compared to 2007,Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked the Minister for National Development (a) how much has HDB spent in its upgrading programme for home owners in 2017 as compared to 2007; (b) how many home owners benefited from the upgrading works; and (c) how have these works translated to enhancing the value of the flats.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The estimated expenditure spent in FY2017 on all HDB upgrading programmes was about $590 million. In FY2007, the total amount spent was about $580 million. If we look at just the Main Upgrading Programme (MUP) and the Home Improvement Programme (HIP) alone, about 253,000 flats have benefited from the upgrading works so far, out of a total of 450,000 eligible flats built up to 1986. Another 230,000 flats will benefit from the extension of HIP to cover the flats built between 1987 and 1997.  Upgrading works enhance the value of the flat in several ways, depending on the type of upgrading work. Under programmes such as the Lift Upgrading Programme and the Remaking our Heartland Programme, the Government builds new amenities which improve the living environment, and result in more convenience to residents and added vibrancy to the area. As for programmes such as the HIP, the Government heavily subsidises the works to help resolve common maintenance problems of aging flats. By keeping the flats in good condition, HIP helps flats maintain their value even as they age. Without HIP, potential buyers of older flats and flat owners would have to undertake the works themselves, which can cost up to about $25,000 per flat."
people's association’s malay activity executive committees council,Mr Azmoon Ahmad asked the Minister for Environment and Water Resources & Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (a) what does the People's Association Malay Activity Executive Committees Council (MESRA) set out to achieve and what is its mission; (b) how is MESRA different from the Malay/Muslim Community Leaders Forum (CLF); and (c) whether the CLF Steering Committee is still functioning and if it has achieved its objectives since it was formed in 2003.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The People's Association Malay Activity Executive Committees Co-ordinating Council (MESRA) and the Malay Activity Executive Committees (MAECs) play a key role in developing opportunities for which the Malay community can interact and collaborate with other communities and groups in Singapore. MESRA coordinates the efforts of the MAECs, which are based at Community Clubs across Singapore. The Community Leaders’ Forum (CLF) is a platform under MENDAKI, formed in 2003 to support Malay/Muslim Voluntary Organisations (MMOs).Our MMOs are central to efforts to uplift and empower the Malay/Muslim community. The Community Leaders' Forum (CLF) will continue to support the MMOs in areas such as education, youth, family and employability. For example, the Youth-in-Action programme carried out by 12 MMOs, such as the Association of Muslim Professionals, the Majulah Community and the Progress Class Society, addresses low school attendance rates and negative social behaviours, complementing efforts by schools. The CLF will also continue to fund partners that collaborate with community or government agencies to address social issues. For instance, through the Vista Sakinah programme, the CLF funds PPIS (Singapore Muslim Women's Association) to support remarriages and stepfamilies.Over the years, the CLF has made significant progress.  (a) Within 10 years, the number of CLF partners increased from 10 MMOs and two mosques in 2004, to 65 in 2015. (b) The CLF identified service gaps that led to the implementation of flagship programmes by CLF partners, including Tiga M, Community Tuition Subsidy Scheme (CoTS), Family Excellence Circles, and SENSE employability programmes. Having achieved its initial objectives of forging community partnerships and providing capacity building for MMOs, the CLF Steering Committee was succeeded by two committees in 2015 – namely, the Malay/Muslim Capability Development Fund (MMCDF) Steering Committee and the CLF Leadership and Advancement Benefaction Scheme (CLF LABS) Steering Committee – which collectively oversee the CLF. MENDAKI serves as the CLF Secretariat, and also administers the MMCDF, which supports projects by the MMOs. CLF LABS supports youth-led and informal groups in test-bedding innovative ideas with MENDAKI’s seed funding. Moving forward, the Malay/Muslim political office holders and I will strengthen collaboration across our key community institutions – comprising MESRA, MENDAKI, and MUIS. We will strive to enhance MENDAKI's and MESRA's programmes so that they collectively they can reach more community segments, and deliver greater impact. They will also strengthen the last-mile for outreach, as well as expand and develop our pool of volunteers and community leaders. MESRA, MENDAKI and MUIS will work in partnership with government agencies, MMOs and other partners to harness the Malay/Muslim community's energy and creativity to contribute back to the community and the wider society."
update on local enterprise and association development-plus (lead+) programme,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether he will provide an update on (i) the $30 million that was set aside for the Local Enterprise and Association Development-Plus (LEAD+) programme introduced in 2016 to improve the capabilities of Trade Associations and Chambers (TACS) and (ii) the LEAD+ feature to second up to 20 public officers to TACs to forge closer partnerships between the Government and industry and to better the public officers' understanding of the needs of enterprises.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: Trade Associations and Chambers (TACs) have an in-depth understanding of industry needs and growth opportunities, and are connected to extensive business networks. They are able to complement efforts by government agencies to support and reach out to a wide pool of enterprises. Our TACs play important roles to help companies transform their operations, enhance their competitiveness and capture new growth opportunities in domestic and overseas markets. As we move into a new phase of economic development, we must continue to evolve and strengthen the partnership between the Government and TACs.Many TACs have stepped up to work closely with government agencies to catalyse enterprise and industry transformation. For instance, the Singapore Food Manufacturers’ Association and the Singapore Manufacturing Federation worked with JTC to jointly conceptualise the development of JTC Food Hub @ Senoko, which lowers business costs for food companies through features such as a shared cold room and warehouse facility. The Singapore Business Federation has also been working with MTI and Enterprise Singapore to organise training workshops for our companies, so that they know what the benefits are under the Free Trade Agreements which we have signed with other economies. In the area of sector-specific training, the Singapore Precision Engineering and Technology Association and the Logistics Alliance have also worked with SSG to curate a list of SkillsFuture Series courses for their respective industries. These are some of the important roles which we want our TACs to focus on. The Local Enterprise and Association Development-Plus (LEAD+) programme was introduced at Budget 2016 to encourage TACs to raise their internal competencies to be more effective champions of industry transformation. At COS 2018 this year, MTI announced the consolidation of several grant programmes for TAC initiatives, including LEAD+, into a single enhanced LEAD programme to drive comprehensive industry upgrading and internationalisation efforts. The combined LEAD programme budget for 2016-2020 is about $115 million.TACs can now tap on the enhanced LEAD scheme to strengthen their leadership and secretariat teams, improve organisational processes, and deliver new and value-added services to their members. As of June 2018, Enterprise Singapore has provided almost $10 million to 9 TACs to upgrade their internal capabilities. We expect more TACs to come on board over the next few years. The enhanced LEAD programme covers all areas that were previously supported under LEAD+, including the secondment of public officers. Efforts to second public officers to TACs are not new. Prior to Budget 2016, then-SPRING had seconded over 10 public officers to TACs to drive the implementation of key programmes such as the SME Talent Programme and SME Centres. Since Budget 2016, three more officers have been seconded to the TACs. We will facilitate more secondment arrangements for TACs which are keen to play a constructive role, and can organise themselves to work with the Government to transform their sectors and upgrade the capabilities of their members."
nea’s standard protocol for handling feedback about smoking in prohibited areas,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what is the standard protocol for NEA to handle feedback about smokers smoking in prohibited areas; and (b) where there is no pictorial evidence and NEA is unable to catch the culprit red-handed, what other measures are taken to ensure that culprits will be apprehended especially those who have had multiple reports made against them in residential areas.","63 Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what is the progress of efforts to keep our neighbourhood spaces smoke-free; (b) whether banning smoking in more designated areas have resulted in improving a smoke-free environment; (c) whether operators and premise managers are doing their part to stop patrons and visitors from smoking in prohibited areas; and (d) whether there are adequate enforcement resources and penalties to stop smokers who disregard the prohibitions imposed by NEA. Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The Government has over the years progressively extended the smoking prohibition to more public places, to protect more people from the harmful effects of passive tobacco smoke. Such places include the common areas of housing estates such as void decks, fitness corners, and playgrounds, as well as sheltered pedestrian walkways and bus stops. In 2016, the prohibition was further extended to neighbourhood and reservoir parks. Today, smoking is disallowed in more than 32,000 places and progress has been made towards our vision of a smoke-free and conducive living environment.  Generally, smokers appreciate the reasons behind these restrictions and most comply willingly. However, there is a minority who do not, and this is where the concerted efforts of various stakeholders can make a difference. When someone we know – be it a family member or a friend – lights up where he or she should not, we ought to remind them to spare a thought for those around. Such social cues are important for signalling and entrenching the positive social norms that smokers should abide by.Operators and managers of smoking-prohibited premises have a statutory responsibility to stop patrons from smoking and request them to leave if they refuse. Most managers are aware of the important role they play in safeguarding the health of their non-smoking patrons. Managers who fail to discharge their duties will be liable for a maximum fine of $2,000 upon conviction. Regarding the Member's question about the National Environment Agency's (NEA) protocol in responding to feedback on unlawful smoking, NEA upon receiving such feedback, will engage the manager of the relevant smoking-prohibited premises to ensure that signs are prominently displayed to remind smokers of the prohibition, and to remove any misleading cues such as litter bins fitted with ashtrays. If the complaints persist, NEA will undertake further investigations by contacting the complainant and other witnesses for additional information. NEA may also obtain video footage from nearby CCTVs if available. If the alleged offender is identified, NEA will interview the person to ascertain culpability. A summons may then be issued if there is evidence that an offence had been committed. Errant smokers can face fines of up to $1,000 upon conviction.  All said, it is not possible for the NEA to monitor every one of the 32,000 smoking-prohibited places at all times. Residents who come across people smoking in prohibited areas can submit feedback, including details of the incident, to NEA through the myENV mobile application, and NEA's hotline and website. Such information can provide useful leads for us to target areas where breaches of the smoking prohibition occur repeatedly.While enforcement of the smoking prohibition will continue, it is not the panacea to curbing inconsiderate smoking. Our hope is for smokers to be mindful of the potential harm they may cause others, and not light up in places where smoking is prohibited. The families and friends of smokers, as well as the general public can also help reinforce positive social norms through reminders. Ultimately, we would like to help smokers kick the habit for the benefit of their own health, their loved ones, and the community. "
top-performing students opting for further studies in information technology and engineering,"Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked the Minister for Education among the students who perform in the top 10% tier for GCE ""O"" and ""A"" levels (a) what is the proportion who opt to pursue studies related to information technology and engineering fields in each of the last three years; (b) how do these figures compare to those who opt to study medicine and law; and (c) what measures are in place to encourage more of our best and brightest to consider pursuing their studies in engineering, computer sciences, information technology, artificial intelligence and robotics in order to build a strong Singaporean core in these fields.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: Among the top 10% of students in the GCE A-Level exam between 2012 and 2014, 14% entered courses in engineering or information and digital technologies, while 22% entered medicine or law courses at the local Autonomous Universities (AUs). It is not meaningful to compare the numbers for those who take O-Level exams because not all students sit for the O-Level exams, such as those in the Integrated Programme (IP).  MOE encourages and enables our students to discover their inter-ests and strengths through the curriculum taught in our schools and a variety of programmes and experiences, supported by strengthened ed-ucation and career guidance at all levels. For example, to expose students to STEM, 60% of our secondary schools offer Applied Learning Programmes (ALPs) in STEM domains. MOE also organises Science enrichment and mentorship programmes for secondary school and junior college students. The Science Centre Singapore also conducts a range of science-related activities and enrichment programmes to en-courage interest in STEM among the public, including students.  The polytechnics pool their efforts to promote engineering diploma programmes to secondary school students. They hold talks featuring industry practitioners who share why they chose engineering as a career. They also reach out to school teachers and involve them in industry learning journeys and workshops.  Our AUs also offer unique programmes tailored to attract good students with the interest and aptitude in STEM. For example, NTU offers the Renaissance Engineering Programme, and NUS the Global Engineering Programme. SUTD infuses technology and design into every aspect of a student's learning experience."
government's plans to further liberalise energy market,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) how will the further liberalisation of the energy market and introduction of new energy sources such as JTC's SolarRoof project help to moderate prices of electricity in the short term and long term; and (b) what are the Government's plans to further liberalise the energy market.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: Singapore relies on imported fuel to meet our energy needs, with natural gas accounting for about 95% of our electricity generation. Our electricity prices are thus largely driven by movements in the global energy markets, given that we are a small country and price takers for natural gas. Nevertheless, the Energy Market Authority of Singapore, or EMA, has pursued various measures to improve the price-competitiveness of our electricity supply. EMA has progressively introduced competition into our electricity market since the 1990s, so that companies would strive to be more cost-effective and offer better service in competing for customers. This includes our retail electricity market, which EMA has gradually opened up to competition since 2001, by allowing larger businesses to purchase electricity from retailers, instead of buying from SP Group at the regulated tariff. EMA is working to open up the rest of our retail electricity sector through the Open Electricity Market (OEM), which would allow all households and small businesses to choose an electricity supplier and price plan that best suits their needs. We introduced a soft launch of the OEM in Jurong in April 2018 and are on track to begin the nationwide rollout from the fourth quarter of this year. We will be sharing more details in the next few months.Beyond promoting competitive markets, the government has also sought to diversify our sources of generation, to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and exposure to volatile global fuel prices. For instance, we have been working to facilitate the adoption of solar power, which has grown from 0.4 megawatt peak (MWp) in 2008 to around 145 MWp by end-2017. Initiatives such as JTC's SolarRoof project is part of our plan to raise solar adoption further to 350 MWp by 2020, and 1 gigawatt peak (GWp) beyond 2020."
update on trap-neuter-release-manage scheme for stray dogs,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether he can provide an update on the Trap-Neuter-Release-Manage Scheme for stray dogs; (b) what resources can be provided to animal welfare groups who are helping and working with the community to address the stray dog problem; and (c) whether there are plans to regulate the pet industry further to minimise irresponsible abandonment of pets.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The Trap-Neuter-Release-Manage programme, or TNRM in short, is a humane and science-based method to reduce the stray dog population through sterilisation. Our animal welfare groups or AWGs, have been working on localised sterilisation efforts in different areas in Singapore for many years. To take these efforts further, AVA has announced a nation-wide TNRM programme to sterilise more than 70% of the stray dogs in Singapore over five years. AVA plans to implement the programme progressively from the last quarter of this year, with support from AWGs, veterinarians, and other stakeholders. AVA will provide funding support and resources, and maintain oversight over key operational work, such as trapping, sterilisation, and outreach. However, AVA cannot do it alone. The success of this programme requires close partnership with many stakeholders. In particular, we will need AWGs and vets to continue contributing their experience and expertise. For example, AWGs can help with trapping and rehoming efforts while vets can assist with the sterilisation procedure.As for the Member's question on pet abandonment, AVA regularly reviews its regulations and programmes to promote responsible pet ownership. For example, AVA revised the dog licensing regime in March 2017. Pet businesses now have to license all dogs before they are sold. They also have to transfer the dog licenses to the new owners when the dogs are sold or transferred. This helps to improve traceability and deters abandonment. AVA will continue to monitor the effectiveness of the revised dog licensing regime. AVA will take enforcement action against errant pet owners who abandon their dogs. A person found guilty of pet abandonment may be fined up to $10,000 and/or jailed up to 12 months."
trend of graduate under-employment in singapore,Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for Manpower what is the trend of graduate underemployment in Singapore and what Government interventions are in place to facilitate optimal deployment of degree holders to relevant jobs.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: In line with international practice, Singapore tracks time-related underemployment, or the percentage of residents in part-time jobs but willing and able to engage in additional work. Among resident degree holders, such underemployment has remained stable at around 2% over the last decade. Singapore's autonomous universities work closely with industry partners and sector agencies to ensure that course offerings stay relevant to the needs of industry. Increasingly, the curriculum and learning experience are infused with work-learn elements to better prepare students for employment. As a result, our AUs have consistently seen high rates of employment for their graduates. In addition, autonomous universities provide students with career services such as career preparatory workshops and modules on resume writing and interview skills. Career guidance offices also continue to offer such support to their alumni. These efforts are complemented by MySkillsFuture portal, a key source of industry information with tools that enhance our students’ knowledge of employment opportunities and progression pathways in various sectors.Graduates who join the workforce can continue to tap on various SkillsFuture initiatives to acquire new skills and upgrade themselves. They may also take up Adapt and Grow programmes such as the Professional Conversion Programmes to move into new jobs or careers. Those looking for relevant job opportunities can use the MyCareersFuture online portal for smarter and faster job search. Jobseekers who require further assistance in their job search may also approach WSG's Careers Connect or NTUC's Employment and Employability Institute (NTUC's e2i) career centres for help."
proposal for free public transport on buses and mrt for senior citizens during off-peak hours,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the Ministry will consider implementing free public transport on buses and MRT for senior citizens above the age of 75 during off-peak hours; and (b) whether audio announcements on buses to indicate stop locations can be introduced to aid elderly passengers.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan:  Public transport is affordable for our seniors. First, senior citizens above 60 years old enjoy substantial discounts of up to 57% off adult trip fares. With these discounts, their rail and basic bus fares do not exceed 87 cents. Second, with Differential Fares, senior citizens enjoy a further discount of up to 50 cents off their rail fare if they started their journeys before 7.45am. Third, senior citizens who travel frequently can buy monthly concession passes at $60, to enjoy unlimited bus and train rides. Fourth, senior citizens from lower-income households receive further assistance through Public Transport Vouchers.  The Public Transport Council (PTC) regularly reviews our fares to keep them affordable while ensuring the financial sustainability of the public transport network. In fact, over the past three years, fares for senior citizens have decreased as part of the annual Fare Review Exercise. Today, the total discounts for senior citizens travelling on our public transport network amount to about $80 million every year. Larger subsidies for one group of commuters will mean higher fares for other commuters or a heavier burden on taxpayers. The PTC has to balance these difficult trade-offs. As for the Member's second suggestion, I am pleased to inform that all new buses will have visual and audio announcements of the next bus stop."
design of lift lobbies at bto blocks traps rain,Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for National Development what can be done to rectify the situation where BTO blocks' lift lobbies and the walkways between lifts and flats are always drenched during rainy days.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The lift lobbies and common corridors at HDB BTO projects are designed to be naturally lit and ventilated. This open concept design is eco-friendly and lowers maintenance costs. In Singapore's tropical climate, especially during monsoon seasons, rainwater splashing along more open areas like lift lobbies and common corridors in a heavy downpour is inevitable. Hence, for weather protection, common corridors are provided with an extended overhang (that is, a canopy). While this measure is generally adequate, it may not be able to fully prevent the corridor from getting wet during heavy downpours accompanied by strong winds. To avoid water-ponding and overly wet floors during rain, the floors at lift lobbies and common corridors are graded to allow excess water to flow to the scupper drain.HDB introduces rain screens where appropriate, based on feedback from residents as well as its own studies. Nonetheless, such screens are not installed in all locations as some locations need to be kept open and well-ventilated for fire safety reasons. Some residents may also view the rain screens as an obstruction to their view.Members who have feedback on issues related to specific blocks can approach HDB so that we can look into the details."
subsidies for early intervention programmes at pre-school level,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) how many special needs children are receiving subsidies for early intervention programmes at pre-school level under the Enhanced Pilot for Private Intervention Providers (PPIP) scheme; and (b) whether there are plans for increasing the number and geographic distribution of Enhanced PPIP centres.,"Mr Desmond Lee: The Enhanced Pilot for Private Intervention Providers (PPIP) scheme complements the Early Intervention Programme for Infants and Children (EIPIC). It provides developmental and therapy services for children aged 0-6 who are at risk of moderate to severe developmental delays. Parents whose children are referred to EIPIC can also enrol their child in an approved PPIP Early Intervention (EI) programme. Children will receive the same MSF subsidies, whether they enrol in PPIP or EIPIC programme. There are currently 21 EIPIC centres serving 3,000 children with developmental delays. MSF has recently increased the number of PPIP providers from 6 to 10. From 2015 to 2017, an average of 115 children were enrolled in PPIP each year. To ensure that these centres are accessible to parents and children, we have expanded the geographic spread of the centres. Earlier, the six PPIP centres were located in the Central, West and East regions. The current 10 centres operating are geographically spread across the North, North-East, Central, West and East regions. "
update on construction of pedestrian overhead bridge lifts in toa payoh east-novena,Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the Ministry can provide an update on Pedestrian Overhead Bridge (POB) lifts slated for construction in Toa Payoh East-Novena; and (b) whether a lift can be prioritised for the POB in front of 308 Thomson Road.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: To make public transport more accessible, LTA has been retrofitting pedestrian overhead bridges near public transport nodes with lifts. We give priority to bridges which are used by large numbers of less ambulant pedestrians. By the end of this year, we will have completed such retrofitting works at 47 sites, including a recently completed one near Blk 26 Toa Payoh Lorong 6. As for the pedestrian overhead bridge at 308 Thomson Road, the site will undergo major works as part of the North-South Corridor construction. LTA is taking the opportunity to study the various barrier-free crossing options, including the possibility of a lift, at this site. LTA will engage the Grassroot Advisors and other stakeholders in mid-2019 after the preliminary findings are ready."
singapore's contribution to upcoming singapore convention on mediation,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Law (a) what is Singapore's contribution to the anticipated Singapore Convention on Mediation to be signed in August 2019; (b) how will the Convention be promoted; and (c) how is Singapore preparing the legal industry for it.,"Mr K Shanmugam: On 25 June 2018, the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) at its 51st session in New York, decided to recommend to the 73rd United Nations General Assembly the following: (a) first, to adopt a United Nations Convention on International Settlement Agreements Resulting from Mediation; (b) second, to authorise a signing ceremony for the Convention to be held as soon as practicable in 2019 in Singapore; and (c) third, for the Convention to be known as the ""Singapore Convention on Mediation"". The Commission also adopted the Model Law on International Commercial Mediation and International Settlement Agreements Resulting from Mediation.In recent years, mediation has become an increasingly popular means for resolving cross-border commercial disputes. Mediation is cost-effective, flexible and efficient. It is particularly attractive for businesses who wish to preserve relationships and leave open the possibility of working together in future. However, one oft-cited concern of mediation is the lack of enforceability, should one party later renege on his obligations. The Convention will address this concern. It will make it easier for businesses to enforce mediated settlement agreements, provide certainty to users, and facilitate international commerce. Singapore will host the signing ceremony of the Convention in August next year. It will be the first UN treaty named after Singapore. This will put Singapore on the world map for our thought leadership.  Support for Singapore to host the signing of this significant Convention and for the Convention to be known as the ""Singapore Convention on Mediation"" at UNCITRAL was unanimous. This is a strong testament to Singapore's leadership in international dispute resolution and Singapore’s contribution to the development of the Convention. Singapore is today one of the leading cross-border dispute resolution centres in the world. We have a trusted legal system, with strong rule of law. We provide a complete suite of professional dispute resolution services to meet the varying needs of business, including litigation, arbitration and mediation. To this end, we have also set up Maxwell Chambers, the world’s first integrated dispute resolution complex. As part of our efforts to strengthen the dispute resolution eco-system, Singapore has invested heavily in the development of international commercial mediation, including through building up institutions and updating our laws.  (a) In 2014, we set up the Singapore International Mediation Centre (SIMC) to provide international commercial mediation services and the Singapore International Mediation Institute (SIMI) to set standards for mediation and professionalise the sector. (b) In 2016, we set up the Singapore International Dispute Resolution Academy (SIDRA) to complement service and training with research, to develop Singapore thought leadership in negotiation and dispute resolution, including in mediation. (c) In 2017, the Singapore Parliament passed the Mediation Act to strengthen the enforceability of mediated settlement agreements in Singapore. In other words, we have already sought to address in Singapore the fundamental problem which the Convention seeks to overcome.  As part of this effort, Singapore also contributed directly to the development of the Convention at UNCITRAL. We had a multi-agency team which worked hard on this. The team included MinLaw representatives and local industry experts, all of whom played a big part in seeing to the outcome we have today. Over a period of about three years, the delegation worked on the terms of the Convention, negotiating and building consensus when there were different positions amongst member states, and taking steps to ensure that diverse interests were accommodated. This process was chaired by a Singaporean. Overall, our team at UNCITRAL was able to exercise thought leadership on various issues of differences which emerged over the course of negotiation, leading to a successful outcome. While conclusion of the Convention would be a significant achievement, it is but the start of a long journey. Adoption will take time, as individual countries consider the implications of becoming parties to the Convention, get the support of various domestic stakeholders and make the necessary adjustments to enable implementation. When the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (the New York Convention) was first adopted in 1958, it had 10 signatories. This year, as it marks its 60th anniversary, the New York Convention now covers close to 160 parties.The Singapore Convention on Mediation will enter into force six months after three States have signed and ratified the Convention. We hope that a critical mass of like-minded countries can sign on to the Convention in the first instance when the Convention is open for signature in Singapore in August next year. Singapore will support UNCITRAL in its work to promote awareness of the Convention amongst member states. Singapore will also be happy to share our own expertise and experience supporting and developing international commercial mediation. We look forward to welcoming all interested States to Singapore to be the first signatories to the Convention.Within Singapore, the next step is to ensure that we are ""Singapore Convention-ready"" in two ways: first, that our businesses are familiar with and competent in the use of mediation as another tool to handle commercial disputes; and second, that we have a good pool of practitioners who are capable of handling international commercial mediation and advising parties on its use. MinLaw will work with the industry and mediation institutions like the SIMC to conduct briefings to raise awareness of international commercial mediation, and to have available training in this area for interested corporate executives and legal practitioners.  The Singapore Convention on Mediation is a great opportunity for Singapore to further strengthen our reputation as an international dispute resolution hub and for our legal industry to play a greater role in this growth area. My Ministry looks forward to working closely with the legal industry to propagate the benefits of the Convention and the strengths of our dispute resolution services to ensure that the needs of international commercial businesses operating out of Singapore continue to be well-served."
singapore’s role post trump-kim summit,Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs after the Trump-Kim summit (a) what role can Singapore play to keep up the momentum for dialogue between the US and North Korea; (b) whether Singapore is involved in any diplomatic efforts to encourage the denuclearisation of North Korea; and (c) how has the summit strengthened relations between Singapore and North Korea.,"Dr Vivian Balakrishnan: Singapore acceded to the request by the US and the DPRK to host the Summit between US President Donald Trump and DPRK State Affairs Commission Chairman Kim Jong Un on 12 June 2018. We did so in order to facilitate peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula.Before I address the role of Singapore in future developments on the Korean Peninsula, allow me to highlight two key features of the Summit that resonated with some of the key attributes of Singapore.First, the choice of Singapore as the venue of the Summit reaffirmed our reputation as an impartial, reliable and safe country. We did not put our hand up or volunteer to host the Summit, but we were pleased to provide a conducive and secure venue which had the full confidence of both parties. The US and the DPRK have publicly stated that they selected Singapore as host because we are politically neutral. Singaporeans can take pride in this expression of trust and confidence in us. We should continue to uphold our reputation as a credible, trusted and consistent partner that is able to play a constructive role on the international stage.Second, hosting the Summit highlighted the importance of a whole-of-government effort. While MFA was the lead coordinating agency, an undertaking of this scale and nature is not something that MFA can do alone. We worked closely with other Ministries and agencies, including MHA, MINDEF and MCI, amongst others, to organise the Summit. The various agencies had to deal with the major security and logistical challenges, as well as facilitating the large global media presence. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all members of Team Singapore who made this Summit possible. I am also grateful to all Singaporeans for your understanding and patience during the Summit.  Let me now address the question on Singapore's role in the dialogue between the US and the DPRK. We were not involved in the direct bilateral discussions between the US and the DPRK that led to the signing of the Joint Statement between the two leaders in Singapore. Neither are we party to the ongoing discussions between the US, Japan, ROK, China, Russia and the DPRK. Singapore welcomes the Joint Statement at the Singapore Summit, which is an important step forward, and we wish the US and the DPRK success in implementing it.  Of course, we are aware that the Summit is only the first step in a long and difficult peace process. We hope that the US and the DPRK will continue to engage in dialogue and make efforts towards peace, building on the agreement forged during the Singapore Summit. The ASEAN Foreign Ministers have also issued a statement welcoming the successful conclusion of the Summit.Although Singapore is not party to the ongoing negotiations on the Korean Peninsula, anything that happens on the Peninsula will affect the rest of the region, including Singapore. It is in our collective interest to see a peaceful, stable and denuclearised Korean Peninsula, and we will continue to support efforts to these ends. What are some of these efforts? On our part, we encourage the DPRK's engagement with the international community, such as through participation in multilateral fora. One of these is the ASEAN Regional Forum, or the ARF for short, which was just held in Singapore over the last weekend on 4 August 2018. The ARF is a constructive platform for participants to promote confidence-building and preventive diplomacy in the region. It is currently the only ASEAN-led platform that the DPRK is a member of, and we hope that their continued participation in the ARF would contribute to efforts in resolving the situation on the Korean Peninsula. The Singapore Summit has also helped broaden our relations with the DPRK. Prime Minister Lee met Chairman Kim on the sidelines of the Summit, where the two leaders exchanged views on Singapore-DPRK relations, as well as developments in the DPRK and on the Korean Peninsula. I also visited Pyongyang in the lead-up to the Summit, at the invitation of Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho. During my visit, I called on President of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly Kim Yong Nam, and met Foreign Minister Ri. We had wide-ranging and frank discussions on bilateral relations, developments on the Korean Peninsula and global issues. I continued my discussion on these issues when I hosted Foreign Minister Ri on his visit to Singapore last week, in conjunction with his participation in the ARF. These engagements with the DPRK have increased the mutual understanding between our two countries.At the same time, notwithstanding the positive developments on the Korean Peninsula in recent months, the reality is that United Nations Security Council sanctions on the DPRK remain in place. All UN Member States, including Singapore, are obligated to implement the UN Security Council Resolutions. We take our international obligations seriously, and remain committed to fully implementing the sanctions. We look forward to concrete progress towards the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula, which would create an environment for the easing of sanctions. We will continue to keep our channels with the DPRK open, while fully complying with the UN Security Council Resolutions. We encourage the DPRK to continue engaging with the international community through multilateral fora. We hope that all parties involved will continue the dialogue and efforts towards establishing lasting peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula."
impact of digitalisation on bank tellers and their jobs,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Prime Minister in light of the announcement by a major bank to reduce the number of bank tellers by half (a) whether there will be similar changes across the banking industry; (b) what are the measures in place to help older residents migrate to digital banking; and (c) how is the Ministry helping bank tellers who are at risk of losing their jobs as digitalisation persists.,"Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): Technology is changing the way that financial services are being provided and used. Consumers in Singapore, as in other countries, are increasingly making use of their smartphones for electronic payments and other banking transactions. This reduces the demand for physical bank branches, and for bank tellers. However, this also means new jobs are created in areas such as service ambassadors, software development for banking apps, data analytics for consumer insights, and cyber security.  The opportunities presented by technology are immense. But the upside is limited by how much we can retrain and reskill employees to take on new roles, and to educate and help consumers to embrace technology.On the first1, the approach taken by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is to work closely with the banks and unions, to pre-emptively reskill and redeploy affected employees into new job roles.  Specifically for jobs in consumer banking, NTUC, MAS, Workforce Singapore, the Institute of Banking and Finance (IBF), and the banks have put together a professional conversion programme to reskill bank tellers and customer servicing staff to take on new roles in relationship management, quality assurance, process re-design, data analytics and digital marketing. Through the programme, the major consumer banks have committed to retrain 3,500 employees over the next three years under the PCP. To date, more than 800 employees have commenced training, of which over 450 have successfully completed their training and have been deployed into new roles. PCPs are in the works for three other areas in banking, namely operations, technology and wealth management. In the case of the bank which the member asked about, as announced by the bank earlier, it has committed to retrain existing customer service officers at branches to take on these new roles, and does not expect them to be retrenched.Digital banking models will become more ubiquitous in the years ahead. This is a trend not just in banking, but across industries. With close collaborations between Government, unions and employers, we will do our best to educate and help consumers, and to retrain workers, so that Singaporeans can ride the wave of the digital revolution.  "
treatments that blend western and traditional chinese medicine,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Health (a) how many clinical trials featuring integrative treatments that utilise Western and Traditional Chinese Medicine are in the works; and (b) how will the landscape for integrative medicine evolve in the years to come and what are the expected treatment costs.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong:  The Ministry of Health has been encouraging collaborative research between researchers and practitioners in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and those from our healthcare institutions and institutes of higher learning.  To support this, the Ministry established the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Research Grant in 2013. We have provided $8 million funding to date. Ten research projects were funded after the first two grants calls, and they are in various stages of progress. Examples of the collaborative projects include (i) a randomized controlled trial conducted by the Singapore Eye Research Institute and Singapore Chung Hwa Medical Institution on the use of acupuncture and herbal treatment in dry eyes, and (ii) a study conducted by KK Hospital and Singapore Thong Chai Medical Institution on the supportive role of TCM in the management of mild to moderate childhood asthma. The third grant call closed on 30 June 2018 and the proposals are being reviewed. TCM plays a complementary role in our healthcare system. Where evidence for efficacy and safety is demonstrated, like acupuncture for pain management and post-stroke rehabilitation, our public healthcare institutions have incorporated these into the care for patients. As more research evidence supporting its efficacy emerges, TCM can play a larger role. However, as we are still in the early stages of our research collaborations, we are unable to estimate the future costs of treatments integrating conventional western and traditional Chinese medicine. We will continue to monitor the progress and evaluate research evidence supporting not only its effectiveness but also its safety when TCM is used together with modern mainstream medicine."
retrenchment benefits paid out by companies that retrench workers for reasons not related to financial distress,Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for Manpower what levers are available to the Ministry to ensure that retrenchment benefits meet industry norms in the case of companies that retrench workers for reasons not related to financial distress.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: Companies must pay retrenchment benefits to workers who have served two years and above, if it is specified in their individual employment contracts or the collective agreements negotiated by their unions. Tripartite partners recognise that retrenchment is a difficult time for companies and affected employees. In this regard, we issued the Tripartite Advisory on Managing Excess Manpower and Responsible Retrenchment to provide guidance to employers on implementing retrenchment in a fair and responsible manner. The Advisory states that the prevailing norm is to pay a retrenchment benefit of between 2 weeks to 1 month of salary per year of service, depending on the financial position of the company and industry practices. According to our survey on retrenchment benefits in 2017, around 90% of establishments which retrenched workers paid retrenchment benefits, of which more than 70% paid retrenchment benefits that met or exceeded the prevailing norms.Retrenched workers who have not been paid retrenchment benefits as specified in their employment contracts can lodge a claim at the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM) for mediation. If mediation fails, the claim will be heard at the Employment Claims Tribunals. Retrenched workers who do not have retrenchment benefits specified in their employment contracts can also approach TADM for advisory and mediation services. For eligible union members with retrenchment benefit disputes, the unions will help to negotiate an agreement with the employer. If no agreement can be reached, the unions can refer the disputes to the Ministry of Manpower for conciliation, failing which the disputes can be arbitrated at the Industrial Arbitration Court."
bicycles with long handlebars not allowed on footpaths,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether any action is taken to ensure that owners of bicycles with handlebars exceeding 700 mm length are made aware that such bicycles are not allowed on footpaths and walkways; and (b) whether owners are given reasonable opportunity to change their handlebars without their bicycles being impounded immediately when they are found on footpaths and walkways.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: After extensive public consultation in 2015, the Active Mobility Advisory Panel recommended that bicycles used on public paths be subject to a maximum width of 700 mm. This is to ensure that there is sufficient space for cyclists to pass other path users, including individuals in wheelchairs, safely on footpaths that may only be 1.5 metres wide. This width limit has been widely publicised by LTA since 2016 through numerous platforms including videos, posters and banners. LTA also works with retailers, interest groups and Active Mobility Patrol volunteers to reach out to the public about this width limit. Participants in the Safe Riding Programme developed by LTA and the Singapore Road Safety Council are also informed of this width limit. It is an offence to use a non-compliant bicycle on public paths, and bicycle owners should proactively ensure that their bicycles are compliant before using them on public paths. Non-compliant bicycles may be seized if they are found to be used on public paths, and users could be liable for a fine of up to $5,000, imprisonment up to three months or to both."
advance medical directive as opt-out scheme for older and terminally ill persons,Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry will consider implementing the Advance Medical Directive as an opt-out scheme for (i) those aged 85 and above and (ii) those aged above 80 who are terminally ill and have been unconscious for more than a year.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Advance Medical Directive (AMD) is a legal document that a person signs in advance, to direct the doctor treating him, not to employ extraordinary life-sustaining treatment to prolong his life, in the event that he suffers a terminal illness and is unable to exercise rational judgement at that time. Making an AMD is a personal, voluntary and optional decision. It represents a person’s considered and rational decision in advance. It is critical to maintain the principle that the decision on whether to accept or reject treatment should be considered carefully and made personally. Hence we do not support an opt-out scheme for AMD. Where a person is unable to communicate his preference and has not made an AMD, decisions relating to the care should be made by the attending doctor, in close consultation with family members and care givers, taking into consideration the best interest of the person, and any documented personal preferences."
foreign domestic worker grant eligibility for those with mentally disabled parents living in separate households,"Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry will consider equalising the treatment of assessing Foreign Domestic Worker (FDW) Grant eligibility for (i) FDWs employed by children of mentally disabled parents to take care of their parents at separate households and (ii) FDWs employed directly by parents who are compos mentis and living in separate households, through sponsorship of their children and, if not, why not.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Foreign Domestic Worker Grant (FDWG) provides a monthly grant of $120 to help families employ an FDW to care for their loved ones who require permanent assistance with three or more Activities of Daily Living. As the grant is targeted at lower and middle income households, employers with household monthly income per person of $2,600 or lower will be eligible for the grant.Regardless of whether the FDW is employed by a family member living in a separate household, or the care recipient himself/herself, we consistently assess the means of the FDW employer's household in determining the eligibility for the grant. This allows us to take into account the needs of the employer who is directly responsible for paying the salary of the FDW. Nevertheless, we will also consider appeals from families who have extenuating circumstances and genuinely require financial aid."
nea’s standard protocol for handling feedback about smoking in prohibited areas,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what is the standard protocol for NEA to handle feedback about smokers smoking in prohibited areas; and (b) where there is no pictorial evidence and NEA is unable to catch the culprit red-handed, what other measures are taken to ensure that culprits will be apprehended especially those who have had multiple reports made against them in residential areas.","63 Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what is the progress of efforts to keep our neighbourhood spaces smoke-free; (b) whether banning smoking in more designated areas have resulted in improving a smoke-free environment; (c) whether operators and premise managers are doing their part to stop patrons and visitors from smoking in prohibited areas; and (d) whether there are adequate enforcement resources and penalties to stop smokers who disregard the prohibitions imposed by NEA. Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The Government has over the years progressively extended the smoking prohibition to more public places, to protect more people from the harmful effects of passive tobacco smoke. Such places include the common areas of housing estates such as void decks, fitness corners, and playgrounds, as well as sheltered pedestrian walkways and bus stops. In 2016, the prohibition was further extended to neighbourhood and reservoir parks. Today, smoking is disallowed in more than 32,000 places and progress has been made towards our vision of a smoke-free and conducive living environment.  Generally, smokers appreciate the reasons behind these restrictions and most comply willingly. However, there is a minority who do not, and this is where the concerted efforts of various stakeholders can make a difference. When someone we know – be it a family member or a friend – lights up where he or she should not, we ought to remind them to spare a thought for those around. Such social cues are important for signalling and entrenching the positive social norms that smokers should abide by.Operators and managers of smoking-prohibited premises have a statutory responsibility to stop patrons from smoking and request them to leave if they refuse. Most managers are aware of the important role they play in safeguarding the health of their non-smoking patrons. Managers who fail to discharge their duties will be liable for a maximum fine of $2,000 upon conviction. Regarding the Member's question about the National Environment Agency's (NEA) protocol in responding to feedback on unlawful smoking, NEA upon receiving such feedback, will engage the manager of the relevant smoking-prohibited premises to ensure that signs are prominently displayed to remind smokers of the prohibition, and to remove any misleading cues such as litter bins fitted with ashtrays. If the complaints persist, NEA will undertake further investigations by contacting the complainant and other witnesses for additional information. NEA may also obtain video footage from nearby CCTVs if available. If the alleged offender is identified, NEA will interview the person to ascertain culpability. A summons may then be issued if there is evidence that an offence had been committed. Errant smokers can face fines of up to $1,000 upon conviction.  All said, it is not possible for the NEA to monitor every one of the 32,000 smoking-prohibited places at all times. Residents who come across people smoking in prohibited areas can submit feedback, including details of the incident, to NEA through the myENV mobile application, and NEA's hotline and website. Such information can provide useful leads for us to target areas where breaches of the smoking prohibition occur repeatedly.While enforcement of the smoking prohibition will continue, it is not the panacea to curbing inconsiderate smoking. Our hope is for smokers to be mindful of the potential harm they may cause others, and not light up in places where smoking is prohibited. The families and friends of smokers, as well as the general public can also help reinforce positive social norms through reminders. Ultimately, we would like to help smokers kick the habit for the benefit of their own health, their loved ones, and the community. "
top-performing students opting for further studies in information technology and engineering,"Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked the Minister for Education among the students who perform in the top 10% tier for GCE ""O"" and ""A"" levels (a) what is the proportion who opt to pursue studies related to information technology and engineering fields in each of the last three years; (b) how do these figures compare to those who opt to study medicine and law; and (c) what measures are in place to encourage more of our best and brightest to consider pursuing their studies in engineering, computer sciences, information technology, artificial intelligence and robotics in order to build a strong Singaporean core in these fields.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: Among the top 10% of students in the GCE A-Level exam between 2012 and 2014, 14% entered courses in engineering or information and digital technologies, while 22% entered medicine or law courses at the local Autonomous Universities (AUs). It is not meaningful to compare the numbers for those who take O-Level exams because not all students sit for the O-Level exams, such as those in the Integrated Programme (IP).  MOE encourages and enables our students to discover their inter-ests and strengths through the curriculum taught in our schools and a variety of programmes and experiences, supported by strengthened ed-ucation and career guidance at all levels. For example, to expose students to STEM, 60% of our secondary schools offer Applied Learning Programmes (ALPs) in STEM domains. MOE also organises Science enrichment and mentorship programmes for secondary school and junior college students. The Science Centre Singapore also conducts a range of science-related activities and enrichment programmes to en-courage interest in STEM among the public, including students.  The polytechnics pool their efforts to promote engineering diploma programmes to secondary school students. They hold talks featuring industry practitioners who share why they chose engineering as a career. They also reach out to school teachers and involve them in industry learning journeys and workshops.  Our AUs also offer unique programmes tailored to attract good students with the interest and aptitude in STEM. For example, NTU offers the Renaissance Engineering Programme, and NUS the Global Engineering Programme. SUTD infuses technology and design into every aspect of a student's learning experience."
government's plans to further liberalise energy market,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) how will the further liberalisation of the energy market and introduction of new energy sources such as JTC's SolarRoof project help to moderate prices of electricity in the short term and long term; and (b) what are the Government's plans to further liberalise the energy market.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: Singapore relies on imported fuel to meet our energy needs, with natural gas accounting for about 95% of our electricity generation. Our electricity prices are thus largely driven by movements in the global energy markets, given that we are a small country and price takers for natural gas. Nevertheless, the Energy Market Authority of Singapore, or EMA, has pursued various measures to improve the price-competitiveness of our electricity supply. EMA has progressively introduced competition into our electricity market since the 1990s, so that companies would strive to be more cost-effective and offer better service in competing for customers. This includes our retail electricity market, which EMA has gradually opened up to competition since 2001, by allowing larger businesses to purchase electricity from retailers, instead of buying from SP Group at the regulated tariff. EMA is working to open up the rest of our retail electricity sector through the Open Electricity Market (OEM), which would allow all households and small businesses to choose an electricity supplier and price plan that best suits their needs. We introduced a soft launch of the OEM in Jurong in April 2018 and are on track to begin the nationwide rollout from the fourth quarter of this year. We will be sharing more details in the next few months.Beyond promoting competitive markets, the government has also sought to diversify our sources of generation, to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and exposure to volatile global fuel prices. For instance, we have been working to facilitate the adoption of solar power, which has grown from 0.4 megawatt peak (MWp) in 2008 to around 145 MWp by end-2017. Initiatives such as JTC's SolarRoof project is part of our plan to raise solar adoption further to 350 MWp by 2020, and 1 gigawatt peak (GWp) beyond 2020."
update on trap-neuter-release-manage scheme for stray dogs,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether he can provide an update on the Trap-Neuter-Release-Manage Scheme for stray dogs; (b) what resources can be provided to animal welfare groups who are helping and working with the community to address the stray dog problem; and (c) whether there are plans to regulate the pet industry further to minimise irresponsible abandonment of pets.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The Trap-Neuter-Release-Manage programme, or TNRM in short, is a humane and science-based method to reduce the stray dog population through sterilisation. Our animal welfare groups or AWGs, have been working on localised sterilisation efforts in different areas in Singapore for many years. To take these efforts further, AVA has announced a nation-wide TNRM programme to sterilise more than 70% of the stray dogs in Singapore over five years. AVA plans to implement the programme progressively from the last quarter of this year, with support from AWGs, veterinarians, and other stakeholders. AVA will provide funding support and resources, and maintain oversight over key operational work, such as trapping, sterilisation, and outreach. However, AVA cannot do it alone. The success of this programme requires close partnership with many stakeholders. In particular, we will need AWGs and vets to continue contributing their experience and expertise. For example, AWGs can help with trapping and rehoming efforts while vets can assist with the sterilisation procedure.As for the Member's question on pet abandonment, AVA regularly reviews its regulations and programmes to promote responsible pet ownership. For example, AVA revised the dog licensing regime in March 2017. Pet businesses now have to license all dogs before they are sold. They also have to transfer the dog licenses to the new owners when the dogs are sold or transferred. This helps to improve traceability and deters abandonment. AVA will continue to monitor the effectiveness of the revised dog licensing regime. AVA will take enforcement action against errant pet owners who abandon their dogs. A person found guilty of pet abandonment may be fined up to $10,000 and/or jailed up to 12 months."
trend of graduate under-employment in singapore,Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for Manpower what is the trend of graduate underemployment in Singapore and what Government interventions are in place to facilitate optimal deployment of degree holders to relevant jobs.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: In line with international practice, Singapore tracks time-related underemployment, or the percentage of residents in part-time jobs but willing and able to engage in additional work. Among resident degree holders, such underemployment has remained stable at around 2% over the last decade. Singapore's autonomous universities work closely with industry partners and sector agencies to ensure that course offerings stay relevant to the needs of industry. Increasingly, the curriculum and learning experience are infused with work-learn elements to better prepare students for employment. As a result, our AUs have consistently seen high rates of employment for their graduates. In addition, autonomous universities provide students with career services such as career preparatory workshops and modules on resume writing and interview skills. Career guidance offices also continue to offer such support to their alumni.

proposal for free public transport on buses and mrt for senior citizens during off-peak hours,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the Ministry will consider implementing free public transport on buses and MRT for senior citizens above the age of 75 during off-peak hours; and (b) whether audio announcements on buses to indicate stop locations can be introduced to aid elderly passengers.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan:  Public transport is affordable for our seniors. First, senior citizens above 60 years old enjoy substantial discounts of up to 57% off adult trip fares. With these discounts, their rail and basic bus fares do not exceed 87 cents. Second, with Differential Fares, senior citizens enjoy a further discount of up to 50 cents off their rail fare if they started their journeys before 7.45am. Third, senior citizens who travel frequently can buy monthly concession passes at $60, to enjoy unlimited bus and train rides. Fourth, senior citizens from lower-income households receive further assistance through Public Transport Vouchers.  The Public Transport Council (PTC) regularly reviews our fares to keep them affordable while ensuring the financial sustainability of the public transport network. In fact, over the past three years, fares for senior citizens have decreased as part of the annual Fare Review Exercise. Today, the total discounts for senior citizens travelling on our public transport network amount to about $80 million every year. Larger subsidies for one group of commuters will mean higher fares for other commuters or a heavier burden on taxpayers. The PTC has to balance these difficult trade-offs. As for the Member's second suggestion, I am pleased to inform that all new buses will have visual and audio announcements of the next bus stop."
design of lift lobbies at bto blocks traps rain,Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for National Development what can be done to rectify the situation where BTO blocks' lift lobbies and the walkways between lifts and flats are always drenched during rainy days.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The lift lobbies and common corridors at HDB BTO projects are designed to be naturally lit and ventilated. This open concept design is eco-friendly and lowers maintenance costs. In Singapore's tropical climate, especially during monsoon seasons, rainwater splashing along more open areas like lift lobbies and common corridors in a heavy downpour is inevitable. Hence, for weather protection, common corridors are provided with an extended overhang (that is, a canopy). While this measure is generally adequate, it may not be able to fully prevent the corridor from getting wet during heavy downpours accompanied by strong winds. To avoid water-ponding and overly wet floors during rain, the floors at lift lobbies and common corridors are graded to allow excess water to flow to the scupper drain.HDB introduces rain screens where appropriate, based on feedback from residents as well as its own studies. Nonetheless, such screens are not installed in all locations as some locations need to be kept open and well-ventilated for fire safety reasons. Some residents may also view the rain screens as an obstruction to their view.Members who have feedback on issues related to specific blocks can approach HDB so that we can look into the details."
subsidies for early intervention programmes at pre-school level,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) how many special needs children are receiving subsidies for early intervention programmes at pre-school level under the Enhanced Pilot for Private Intervention Providers (PPIP) scheme; and (b) whether there are plans for increasing the number and geographic distribution of Enhanced PPIP centres.,"Mr Desmond Lee: The Enhanced Pilot for Private Intervention Providers (PPIP) scheme complements the Early Intervention Programme for Infants and Children (EIPIC). It provides developmental and therapy services for children aged 0-6 who are at risk of moderate to severe developmental delays. Parents whose children are referred to EIPIC can also enrol their child in an approved PPIP Early Intervention (EI) programme. Children will receive the same MSF subsidies, whether they enrol in PPIP or EIPIC programme. There are currently 21 EIPIC centres serving 3,000 children with developmental delays. MSF has recently increased the number of PPIP providers from 6 to 10. From 2015 to 2017, an average of 115 children were enrolled in PPIP each year. To ensure that these centres are accessible to parents and children, we have expanded the geographic spread of the centres. Earlier, the six PPIP centres were located in the Central, West and East regions. The current 10 centres operating are geographically spread across the North, North-East, Central, West and East regions. "
update on construction of pedestrian overhead bridge lifts in toa payoh east-novena,Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the Ministry can provide an update on Pedestrian Overhead Bridge (POB) lifts slated for construction in Toa Payoh East-Novena; and (b) whether a lift can be prioritised for the POB in front of 308 Thomson Road.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: To make public transport more accessible, LTA has been retrofitting pedestrian overhead bridges near public transport nodes with lifts. We give priority to bridges which are used by large numbers of less ambulant pedestrians. By the end of this year, we will have completed such retrofitting works at 47 sites, including a recently completed one near Blk 26 Toa Payoh Lorong 6. As for the pedestrian overhead bridge at 308 Thomson Road, the site will undergo major works as part of the North-South Corridor construction. LTA is taking the opportunity to study the various barrier-free crossing options, including the possibility of a lift, at this site. LTA will engage the Grassroot Advisors and other stakeholders in mid-2019 after the preliminary findings are ready."
update on local enterprise and association development-plus (lead+) programme,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether he will provide an update on (i) the $30 million that was set aside for the Local Enterprise and Association Development-Plus (LEAD+) programme introduced in 2016 to improve the capabilities of Trade Associations and Chambers (TACS) and (ii) the LEAD+ feature to second up to 20 public officers to TACs to forge closer partnerships between the Government and industry and to better the public officers' understanding of the needs of enterprises.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: Trade Associations and Chambers (TACs) have an in-depth understanding of industry needs and growth opportunities, and are connected to extensive business networks. They are able to complement efforts by government agencies to support and reach out to a wide pool of enterprises. Our TACs play important roles to help companies transform their operations, enhance their competitiveness and capture new growth opportunities in domestic and overseas markets. As we move into a new phase of economic development, we must continue to evolve and strengthen the partnership between the Government and TACs.Many TACs have stepped up to work closely with government agencies to catalyse enterprise and industry transformation. For instance, the Singapore Food Manufacturers’ Association and the Singapore Manufacturing Federation worked with JTC to jointly conceptualise the development of JTC Food Hub @ Senoko, which lowers business costs for food companies through features such as a shared cold room and warehouse facility. The Singapore Business Federation has also been working with MTI and Enterprise Singapore to organise training workshops for our companies, so that they know what the benefits are under the Free Trade Agreements which we have signed with other economies. In the area of sector-specific training, the Singapore Precision Engineering and Technology Association and the Logistics Alliance have also worked with SSG to curate a list of SkillsFuture Series courses for their respective industries. These are some of the important roles which we want our TACs to focus on. The Local Enterprise and Association Development-Plus (LEAD+) programme was introduced at Budget 2016 to encourage TACs to raise their internal competencies to be more effective champions of industry transformation. At COS 2018 this year, MTI announced the consolidation of several grant programmes for TAC initiatives, including LEAD+, into a single enhanced LEAD programme to drive comprehensive industry upgrading and internationalisation efforts. The combined LEAD programme budget for 2016-2020 is about $115 million.TACs can now tap on the enhanced LEAD scheme to strengthen their leadership and secretariat teams, improve organisational processes, and deliver new and value-added services to their members. As of June 2018, Enterprise Singapore has provided almost $10 million to 9 TACs to upgrade their internal capabilities. We expect more TACs to come on board over the next few years. The enhanced LEAD programme covers all areas that were previously supported under LEAD+, including the secondment of public officers. Efforts to second public officers to TACs are not new. Prior to Budget 2016, then-SPRING had seconded over 10 public officers to TACs to drive the implementation of key programmes such as the SME Talent Programme and SME Centres. Since Budget 2016, three more officers have been seconded to the TACs. We will facilitate more secondment arrangements for TACs which are keen to play a constructive role, and can organise themselves to work with the Government to transform their sectors and upgrade the capabilities of their members."
progress on raising awareness for climate change,"Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what is the progress thus far on raising the awareness of climate change; (b) what is the number of individuals, organisations and educational institutions that have taken the Climate Action Pledge; (c) what are the plans to include more individuals, organisations and educational institutions in the second-half of the year; and (d) whether the Ministry will work with or track the organisations and educational institutions in terms of their follow-up actions and, if so, how.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Singapore designated 2018 as the Year of Climate Action to raise awareness of climate change and to urge people to take climate action for a sustainable future. The public response has been very good. Many community groups, grassroots organisations, corporations, schools and NGOs have stepped forward to organise events and activities to raise awareness of the importance and impact of climate change, and to encourage the public to take responsibility to live more sustainable lifestyles.Since the Year of Climate Action was launched on 26 January 2018, more than a quarter million climate action pledges have been received. Of these, 221 are from educational institutions and 266 are from organisations, including NGOs. Many initiatives have come out of this Year of Climate Action. Let me highlight a few. The National Youth Council (NYC) is organising a series of youth conversations throughout the year, and climate change is a key topic. Youths have shown keen interest in how they can contribute to climate action. The Singapore Scout Association has introduced a new Climate Action Programme, where Scouts earn Climate Action Ambassador Badges by initiating climate action activities and encouraging the community to do likewise. The Singapore Environment Council (SEC) has launched an EcoLifeSG app which helps users to calculate and track their carbon footprint. As part of UN Environment's call to action on World Environment Day, City Developments Limited (CDL) and Global Initiatives (GI) launched a ‘live’ art installation at the Marina Barrage using discarded plastic bottles to raise awareness on the urgent need to reduce single-use plastics.Recently I went to the UN to present Singapore's first Voluntary National Review (VNR) at the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development. I shared that Singapore's sustainable development is a Whole-of-Nation effort. Since our independence, we have balanced economic growth with environment protection and social inclusion. We have also taken a long-term approach towards policy implementation, based on collaborative multi-stakeholder partnerships. Our Year of Climate Action efforts is a good example of how we have come together as a nation to fight climate change and ensure sustainable development.  We will continue to work with stakeholders to promote climate action messages in the second half of the year. The recent Partners for the Environment Forum on 10 July 2018 was themed ""Accelerating Action on Climate Change"", and gathered more than 260 participants to discuss how to better collaborate on climate action. A Climate Action SG Alliance has been formed by 18 corporate, educational and civil society leaders to develop new climate action initiatives to rally the public. In the coming months, they will look at how to promote education in schools on waste minimisation, how to encourage businesses to be more environmentally sustainable, and how to educate the community on recycling right.Individuals, organisations and educational institutions that have taken the climate action pledge have taken an important step by making a public commitment of their plans. As organisations and institutions are at different stages of their climate action journey, they are able to craft their own pledges to commit to a realistic and achievable climate action plan that works for them. My Ministry will not be tracking the fulfilment of the pledges but will be happy to work with interested parties to support their plans. NEA offers a Climate Action SG Grant for NGOs and interest groups to fund projects that promote climate action messages, promote the 3Rs and energy conservation. Successful applicants receive a grant of up to $5,000. We have also supported organisations with good ideas to reach out to a wider audience. For example, we worked with PacificLight on their climate action-themed ""Crea8 Sustainability"" competitions for educational institutions. We encourage parties who have taken the climate action pledge to share their progress at suitable events so that there is mutual sharing and mutual encouragement as we all walk the sustainability journey together for the good of Singapore and the world."
companies’ ability to meet water efficiency benchmarks,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) in the past three years, how effectively are firms meeting water efficiency benchmarks; (b) whether PUB will work closely with those that fail to achieve the benchmarks to help them reduce water wastage; (c) what is the status of the industry consultation on water efficiency practices; and (d) what else is the Ministry doing to keep water consumption manageable.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: As one of the most water-stressed countries in the world, water has always been an existential issue for Singapore. We need to invest ahead in weather-resilient water sources, and expand and renew our water infrastructure and network in a timely manner. But this is not enough. To ensure the long-term sustainability of our water resources, it is equally important that we manage demand and use water prudently.  The non-domestic sector currently makes up more than half of our total water demand, and this is projected to increase to about 70% in 2060. Companies must use water efficiently. PUB requires large water users in the non-domestic sector to monitor their water usage through the installation of water meters and submit a water efficiency management plan annually. Through this process, companies can better understand their water usage patterns and identify ways to conserve water. Since 2015, more than 600 large water users have been submitting their plans annually. This has given PUB insights into how various industries use water and enabled PUB to develop targeted initiatives.During the Committee of Supply debate this year, I announced the launch of the Best Practice Guide on Water Efficiency for the Buildings sector. Another two guides - for the Wafer Fabrication and Semiconductor sector and the Refineries, Petrochemicals and Chemicals sector – were launched during the Singapore International Water Week last month. PUB has also developed water efficiency benchmarks for the office buildings, hotels, retail malls, wafer fabrication and semiconductor sectors. The series of consultations with industries and relevant stakeholders, as Er Dr Lee has mentioned, was instrumental to the development of these guides and benchmarks. PUB will continue to work closely with industries on water efficiency benchmarks and guides for other sectors.Through these benchmarks and guides, companies can assess how well they fare relative to their peers and learn from best practices. As the benchmarks have just been published this year, PUB will monitor the performance of the companies and help them improve their water efficiency, especially those who fall below the median performance. Through one-to-one engagement sessions, PUB advises the companies on opportunities for water savings and offer customised expertise for water recycling and reuse projects. To encourage companies to implement such projects, PUB provides funding support, such as the Water Efficiency Fund and the Industrial Water Solutions Demonstration Fund. Companies can tap on these funds to carry out water audits, water recycling, use of alternate sources of water, and the test-bedding of innovative water technologies. Companies have responded positively, with a number looking to implement new water efficiency projects. For example, PUB has worked with and co-funded Micron Semiconductor Asia Pte Ltd to install a wastewater recycling plant this year. Once implemented, there will be an expected annual reduction of 400,000m3 in their NEWater demand.To recognise exemplary companies, PUB introduced the Water Efficiency Awards in 2017 for companies who are within the top 10th percentile of the industry-specific benchmarks. Last year, 27 award recipients from seven industries were presented with these awards.  PUB is taking it one step further. From 2019, all large water users will need to appoint a certified water efficiency manager who has undergone training on how to conduct water audits and implement water efficiency measures. This will level up the capabilities of the industries in managing their water use.Water is valuable and I urge all companies to look into water conservation efforts. PUB stands ready to help companies in this."
singapore's efforts at managing climate change,Mr Seah Kian Peng asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) how are Singapore's efforts to manage this year's climate change proceeding; (b) whether such efforts are sufficient in light of the forecast by the Climate Prediction Centre of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of a 70% chance that El Nino will develop during end-2018; and (c) what countermeasures will Singapore adopt should El Nino develop.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Climate change poses existential challenges for Singapore as an island city-state. In 2016, we published our Climate Action Plan which outlines Singapore’s long-term strategy to mitigate and adapt to climate change. We continue to build on these plans.  This year, we announced the introduction of a carbon tax which will take effect from 2019. This tax will incentivise emissions reduction across the economy and encourage our companies to adopt more energy efficient practices as we transition to a low-carbon future. We have also made progress in adapting Singapore to the potential impacts of climate change. In June, we opened Singapore’s third desalination plant in Tuas, and two more are currently under development. These weather-resilient sources will contribute to our water resilience as we continue to diversify our water supply. To prepare for warmer temperatures, agencies have put in place precautionary guidelines for groups that are at higher risk of heat injury, such as outdoor workers. Across government, agencies will continue to take steps to build a carbon-efficient and climate-resilient Singapore.But climate action cannot be the sole undertaking of the government. Everyone must participate in this effort. This is why we have designated 2018 as the Year of Climate Action, to raise our national consciousness of climate change and galvanise ground-up action for a sustainable Singapore. So far, more than 250,000 individuals, organisations, and educational institutions have made Climate Action pledges. We are encouraged by their commitment and hope this momentum continues beyond 2018.The Meteorological Service Singapore (MSS) assesses that there is a 60-70 per cent chance of a weak El Niño developing late in the year. Should the El Niño occur, it is not likely to have a significant impact on rainfall patterns in Singapore and the nearby region, due to its expected weak intensity and late development during the year-end rainy season. We do not expect a repeat of the strong El Niño event experienced in 2015/2016, which was one of the strongest in recent history and led to significantly reduced rainfall in Singapore. The MSS will continue to monitor developments and provide relevant alerts to the public and relevant agencies."
plans for nea's daily-rated staff to be skilled for future jobs,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources what are the plans for NEA's daily-rated staff to receive the necessary skills required for the future jobs under the Environmental Services Industry Transformation Map.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The National Environment Agency (NEA) launched the Skills Framework for Environmental Services (ES) in Dec 2017 as an integral component of the Environmental Services Industry Transformation Map (ES ITM). The framework maps the skills and competencies that workers in the industry need to perform their roles effectively. NEA’s daily-rated employees (DREs) are potential beneficiaries of the ES ITM. To equip DREs with the skillsets for future jobs, NEA has been providing training opportunities such as Workforce Skills Qualifications courses in environmental cleaning, landscape operations and digital literacy. NEA also encourages its DREs to attend relevant training programmes under the ES Skills Framework to broaden and deepen their skills and knowledge. With the requisite training and work experience, DREs may take on more challenging or expanded roles within the agency and in the wider ES industry. One DRE who has benefited from NEA's upskilling efforts is Mr Somasundaram Ganeson. Mr Somasundaram was previously an Environmental Support Assistant who kept the streets clean. At 62, he was recently promoted to be a Higher Environmental Support Assistant in vector control, after completing a vocational course and attaining the skills needed for the new portfolio. Accordingly, he now commands a higher salary. Other DREs have similarly upgraded their skills and taken on new roles. NEA is also working with Post-Secondary Education Institutions to enhance existing technical courses and develop new Continuous Education and Training programmes on relevant topics that would also benefit DREs who wish to upskill and avail themselves of job opportunities in the industry.NEA will continue to partner stakeholders to expand education and training programmes to address the skills and manpower needs of the ES industry."
impact of hyflux’s debt and business reorganisation on singapore's water system and water security,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether the debt and business reorganisation of Hyflux Ltd will affect Singapore's water system and water security.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: PUB’s key interest is to safeguard Singapore's water security and confidence in our water supply. There are two desalination plants that Hyflux is involved in under a Design, Build, Own and Operate arrangement. One is the SingSpring Desalination Plant, which is majority owned by Keppel Infrastructure Trust with Hyflux owning a minority stake. This plant is not affected by Hyflux's recent debt and business reorganisation. The other plant, the Tuaspring Desalination Plant, wholly owned by Tuaspring Pte Ltd, a subsidiary of Hyflux, is affected by the reorganisation, but continues to supply desalinated water to PUB. Hyflux, Tuaspring and its creditor are currently in discussion on the potential divestment of Tuaspring. As this is a commercial matter, it will not be appropriate for my Ministry to comment further. Nonetheless, we are monitoring developments closely. Members of the House can be assured that there are adequate measures in place to ensure the plant remains in operation. Any divestment has to be approved by PUB. Water supply is an existential issue and one which PUB treats with the utmost seriousness. Water supply infrastructure is planned well into the future and investment made ahead of demand. We just opened our latest desalination plant, Tuas Desalination Plant, in June 2018. More water supply infrastructure is being constructed over the next few years. We will not allow the security of our water supply to be affected."
alternative sites for sea burials,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether other alternative sites to Tanah Merah for sea burials will be considered and studied before making a final decision on the location of the sea burial facility proposed at the shoreline of Tanah Merah; and (b) whether the findings of the environmental impact study on this proposal will be published prior to a decision being made.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The National Environment Agency (NEA) has been working with the relevant authorities to identify a suitable site on mainland Singapore for the conduct of post-death rites prior to the scattering of cremated remains at sea. The provision of such a facility is in response to public feedback, to preserve the dignity and decorum of post-death proceedings and to ensure adequate provision of after-death care facilities to meet the needs of the various communities in Singapore.The site at Tanah Merah was proposed in consultation with the relevant authorities and with careful deliberation over competing needs. In addition, NEA has commissioned an Environmental Impact Study to be completed by 2019 to better assess the possible environmental impact of the facility.  NEA has received feedback from stakeholders and engaged interested parties, for example the sailing fraternity, on their suggestions. We will take into account the outcomes of the Environmental Impact Study and suggestions from stakeholders when considering the next steps. NEA will also be engaging stakeholders and interested parties when the study is completed."
elderly patients readmitted within 30 days after discharge from hospital,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the readmission rates for patients aged 65 years and above within 30 days after their discharge from public hospitals have declined in the last five years; and (b) what measures have been taken to minimise readmission.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Across all public hospitals, the readmission rates for patients aged 65 years and older within 30 days after discharge showed a slight increase in the last five years, rising from 18.9% in 2013 to 19.5% in 2017, as our patients get older. After adjusting for patients’ age and severity of their conditions, readmission rates range between 11.6% and 11.8%.Our public hospitals have implemented various programmes to reduce re-admissions. These include the Hospital-to-Home or (""H2H"") programme which provide integrated care support to facilitate patients’ transition home via medication reconciliation, telephonic support, linkages with appropriate community-based services and caregiver training. To date, H2H has served more than 14,000 patients. MOH has also developed more community hospitals, to provide sub-acute as well as rehabilitation care for acute hospital patients who require a longer period of recovery. This enhances the functions and confidence of the patients, thus reducing the risk of readmission.MOH and the public hospitals will continue to work with community and primary care providers to enhance the continuation of care for our patients in the community after their discharge from the hospitals."
special employment credit for freelancers and seniors working in shared economy sector,"Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether the Special Employment Credit (SEC) is applicable for seniors working in the shared economy sector and freelancers; and (b) if not, whether there are any programmes that can help those seniors with a monthly income of less than $4,000.","Mrs Josephine Teo: The Special Employment Credit (SEC) scheme offers direct wage offsets to employers to encourage them to hire older Singaporeans aged 55 and above earning up to $4,000 per month. It is not a wage supplement to the individual and does not apply to self-employed freelancers who generally decide on their own age of retirement.   Nonetheless, there are other schemes to support seniors who are self-employed. The Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) Scheme is applicable to employees as well as self-employed persons (SEPs). Under WIS, older workers earning up to $2,000 monthly receive higher cash payouts and CPF contributions, compared to younger workers earning the same income.Programmes under the Adapt and Grow (A&G) initiative also help older self-employed persons find suitable jobs. For instance, the Career Support Programme (CSP) offers wage support to employers who hire long-term unemployed or retrenched jobseekers, with more funding for older job-seekers. The SEC also helps by incentivising employers to hire older self-employed persons who wish to take on regular jobs."
preserving farrer park field and adjoining facilities for sports heritage,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry will consider preserving Farrer Park Field and the adjoining facilities as the area has a rich sports heritage and memorable sports milestones instead of repurposing it into a residential development.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Farrer Park Field has been used as a sports field since the 1930s. Other sport facilities adjoining the Field such as the Athletic Centre and Swimming Pool were built in the 1950s, and served as the training grounds for many local athletes. Over the years, as newer facilities such as the nearby Jalan Besar Stadium and Swimming Complex and the National Stadium were built, the facilities in the Farrer Park area were less frequently used as competitive sports venues. Today, they are used mainly by the public for recreational sports.The Farrer Park area is close to the city and the Little India MRT interchange, making it suitable for housing. The current plan is to develop the area for housing and community facilities, including a park. We are mindful of the Farrer Park area's history as a sporting ground, and will see how best to weave in elements of the heritage of the area in our future plans. We will seek feedback and ideas from key stakeholders and community partners, as we develop more detailed plans."
prevention of power outage in central business district,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Trade and Industry with regard to the power outage in the CBD area on 1 June 2018 (a) what is being done to prevent future occurrences; and (b) what back-up systems are in place for essential services like traffic signalling systems and medical services.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: The Government recognises the importance of a reliable and secure power system. SP Power Grid (SPPG), the national grid operator, has a comprehensive infrastructure planning and maintenance regime to increase system reliability and minimise disruptions. This includes building in redundancy for critical components, continuous monitoring of the transmission network, and conducting preventive maintenance. We have adopted a calibrated risk-based approach in systems planning, with a framework in place to enable quick restoration of power when needed. So far, this approach has served us well, with our power system being among the most reliable in the world. For instance, from FY13 to FY17, Singapore’s average annual disruption per consumer ranged from 12 seconds to 45 seconds, compared to latest FY15 figures of 4 minutes for Tokyo and 23.4 minutes for Hong Kong.Our investigations show that the blackout in the CBD on 1 June 2018 had occurred due to human error on the part of SPPG and its contractor while carrying out maintenance work at a substation at Ann Siang Hill. Nonetheless, SPPG was able to progressively restore supply to all affected consumers within 34 minutes, which included conducting the necessary tests to identify and rectify the cause of tripping.SPPG has since tightened its maintenance and training protocols to prevent similar incidents in the future. It has also reminded its officers of the need to adhere strictly to standing operating procedures, and instituted additional checks for similar maintenance works. For example, SPPG will be introducing mandatory video recording of maintenance work, which would be reviewed by senior officers before the equipment can be switched on after maintenance works are completed.EMA treats each blackout incident seriously, and will thoroughly investigate each incident and take appropriate regulatory action, such as imposing financial penalties against the relevant parties. Under its existing contractor performance management system, SPPG can also impose strong disciplinary actions, such as immediate suspension of errant contractors. EMA will continue to work closely with SPPG to ensure high standards of reliability for our power system.Essential services, such as traffic signalling systems and public hospitals, have contingency plans to ensure that they are not affected by power outages on the national grid. For instance, Singapore’s road systems are monitored round the clock. In the event of any power outage affecting traffic signals, LTA will work with the Traffic Police to quickly deploy resources where needed, to assist with traffic control at affected junctions. Concurrently, backup generators can also be deployed on-site to provide temporary power supply to mitigate the impact to traffic signal operations. For public hospitals, they are provided with dual supply sources, each of which is able to take the full load of the hospital if the other one fails. If there is any disruption from the main power source, backup power systems, such as diesel generators and Uninterrupted Power Supplies (UPS) systems, would automatically kick in, to support all critical equipment and critical facilities. Hospitals also carry out regular and preventive maintenance to ensure that both their electrical installations and backup power systems are in good working condition."
care provisions in welfare homes and support for re-integration into community,"Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what are the care provisions given in welfare homes in terms of lodging, food, medical assistance; and (b) what actions are taken to facilitate the resident's reconnection with family or re-integration into the community.","Mr Desmond Lee: Welfare Homes provide long-term care and support to destitute persons who are admitted under the Destitute Persons Act. They may be elderly, or may have complex needs such as chronic psychiatric conditions, addiction, and physical or intellectual disabilities. Most have limited or no family support.The Welfare Homes are run by Voluntary Welfare Organisations, with MSF funding. The care teams assess the needs of residents and review their individualised care plans regularly. This is to ensure that they get appropriate support for their physical, emotional and social needs.The residents have their own bed and personal space to store their belongings. Their meals are based on menus endorsed by a nutritionist or dietician. In addition, they undergo regular medical reviews by a doctor and receive nursing care from an in-house nursing team to address their healthcare needs. Residents are provided with fully-subsidised standard medical treatment and medication at public healthcare institutions. Besides these, they also receive counselling and social work support, and if necessary, therapy, to help them resolve their underlying issues and improve their well-being.To ensure that residents receive high standards of care, the Ministry stipulates minimum care standards and conducts unannounced inspections on Welfare Homes. In addition, there is a Board of Visitors, an independent panel of professional volunteers appointed by the Ministry, which visits the Welfare Homes on a regular basis to ensure that care standards are met.At the Welfare Homes, the residents undergo rehabilitation programmes to build social, work, and life skills to prepare them for independent living in the community, wherever possible. Those who are assessed to have high potential for reintegration into society are placed on external employment, home leave, and pre-discharge programmes to support their transition back to the community. They are also linked up with community resources where necessary to support their reintegration. The Welfare Home staff also support family reconciliation to address underlying issues and strengthen family relationships. Volunteers and community agencies work with Welfare Homes to complement their rehabilitative efforts, foster a sense of community belonging in residents, and facilitate their reintegration to society."
review of regulations to protect wild animals near places such as construction sites,Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for National Development whether there will be a review of regulations to protect wild animals in our forested areas such as (i) compelling construction companies and developers to take measures to protect displaced wild animals and (ii) mandating vehicular speed limits or penalties around areas where large swathes of construction work are taking place.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Protecting our biodiversity is key to our City-In-A-Garden vision. That is why we require developers of projects near our nature reserves to assess the potential impact of their works on the flora and fauna in the area. Developers would then need to propose appropriate mitigation measures to protect wildlife based on this assessment, which are evaluated by government agencies. If there are unanticipated environmental impacts or if mitigation measures prove ineffective, the developers should alter their mitigation plans or propose additional measures in consultation with the relevant technical agencies.Depending on the specifics of the project, vehicular speed reduction measures may be required, for instance the installation of humps and road signs. Beyond site-specific measures, our agencies have worked with Traffic Police to include content about wildlife crossings in the Basic Driving Theory handbook. We hope this will encourage motorists to exercise greater caution when they see wildlife crossings indicated, for example, via signs or road markings. Agencies will continue to partner developers, as well as nature groups, to improve wildlife protection around development sites. "
enforcement action against errant users of personal mobility devices,"Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for Transport since the commencement of the Active Mobility Act, what enforcement action has been taken against errant users of public paths who endanger the safety of others.",Mr Khaw Boon Wan: I thank the Member for her question. I have addressed it in my reply at the 9 July 2018 Parliament sitting.
number of public healthcare workers not offered re-employment,"Ms K Thanaletchimi asked the Minister for Health (a) in the past three years, how many mature public healthcare workers were not offered re-employment but were paid Employment Assistance Payment (EAP) upon reaching age 62 and beyond, and why; (b) which job categories were these workers from; and (c) how is the Ministry working with cluster institutions to formulate better job redesign or staff deployment strategies to retain mature workers.","Mr Gan Kim Yong:  Over the past three years, a total of 21 public healthcare workers were not offered re-employment at age 62 and beyond. That is an average of about 1% of total public healthcare workers at age 62 and above per year. Of these, 16 were not eligible for re-employment, as they had under-performed in their jobs or were medically unfit for work. Of the remaining five who were eligible for re-employment, three workers were not re-employed as they had informed their institution that they wished to retire to spend time with their family, or for health reasons. The remaining two mature public healthcare workers were not offered re-employment but were paid the Employee Assistance Payment (EAP). Both were nurses. The payments were mutually agreed after considering their suitability for continued employment and exploring various re-employment options. Our public healthcare institutions have taken a multi-pronged approach to support the retention of mature public healthcare workers, by re-designing work tasks and duties to work “light”, and work “right”. Firstly, to work “light”, institutions have redesigned jobs to introduce automation to lighten the burden of labour-intensive activities. This can support our mature workers in their work roles. For example, institutions now have assistive equipment such as ceiling hoists and bed transporters to aid in patient lifting and transport, as well as Automated Guided Vehicles to transport case notes and meals to wards, to reduce the physical strain of healthcare jobs. Some institutions also placed magnifying glasses on medication carts to aid mature workers. Institutions have also simplified work processes to benefit mature workers. For example, CGH’s mature housekeepers used to have difficulty remembering the application of different types of chemicals for routine cleaning. Hence, CGH now uses a one-step disinfectant, and has reduced the number of cleaning chemicals for ward cleaning from four types to two. Next, to work “right”, institutions harness the abilities of mature workers by assigning tasks that is best suited to them. For instance, mature workers in portering departments may be assigned to take on lighter duties such as delivery of documents whereas younger porters are tasked with patient transfers. To leverage their experience and expertise, some mature nurses are also re-deployed to become training consultants or nursing auditors. Besides redesigning jobs to make work light, and staff deployment to assign work right, the PHIs also support the re-employment of mature workers through pre-retirement preparatory programmes, re-skilling and flexible work arrangements. MOH will continue to work with the public healthcare institutions to engage mature workers and assist them in re-employment. "
evaluation of public construction work tenders after incidence of pie viaduct collapse,"Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for National Development in light of the collapse of the viaduct near the PIE exit to TPE in 2017 (a) how are civil engineering project tenders evaluated; (b) what is the weightage given to price, design quality and safety standards in the evaluation; (c) whether enhancing spot checks and inspections will deter and prevent works that are carried out without the approval of the Commissioner of Building Control; and (d) how does the Ministry conduct its independent design checks to safeguard public safety for all Government projects.","Mr Lawrence Wong: The public sector procurement framework ensures that construction tenders, including civil engineering projects, are evaluated in a fair, transparent and competitive manner, while taking into account considerations such as quality and safety. Government agencies adopt the Price Quality Method framework to evaluate construction tenders, including civil engineering projects, with estimated procurement value of $3 million and above. These tenders are evaluated based on both price and non-price criteria. For civil engineering tenders, the weightage allocated to non-price attributes such as design quality and safety varies from 30% to 50%. Agencies have the flexibility to determine the weightage allocated to non-price attributes, and the allocation to each attribute, depending on project complexity and specific project requirements. For any development involving structural works, there are several layers of checks and controls. At the design stage, the developer must appoint a Qualified Person, or QP, to design the structure in accordance with the relevant codes and requirements to ensure safety. Further, the developer must also appoint an Accredited Checker to review the QP’s design and check on all key structural elements, before the structural design plan is submitted to BCA. In addition, for every submission, BCA will conduct a sampling check of the plans and design calculations of selected key structural elements, to ascertain that the QP and the AC have carried out the design and checks in accordance to the building control legislative requirements. At the construction stage, the builder has to carry out structural works under the supervision of a QP and a team of site supervisors. This is to ensure that the structural works are carried out according to the approved plans. BCA also conducts targeted inspections on structural works. Upon completion of the works, the QP and the builder have to certify that the structural works have been built in accordance with approved plans and building regulations. BCA will take enforcement action against any party who contravenes the regulations. "
action against sale of illegal and sexual enhancement drugs at junction of aljunied road and geylang road,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether there can be further stringent action taken on the sale of illegal drugs and sexual enhancement drugs in an open and blatant manner at the junction of Aljunied Road and Geylang Road.,"Mr K Shanmugam: Since 2015, we have adopted a coordinated, multi-agency approach to tackle illicit activities in Geylang, including the sale of sexual enhancement drugs and adulterated health products that the Member mentioned. The Police, Central Narcotics Bureau and the Health Sciences Authority are involved in these coordinated operations.For this purpose, an inter-agency operations centre (IAOC) led by Police was established at the Geylang Neighbourhood Police Centre in 2016.Also, to optimise resources, the various law enforcement agencies have pooled and re-organised their respectively contracted auxiliary police officers into coordinated enforcement teams. Since 2016, these APO enforcement teams have performed high-visibility patrols in Geylang and enforced against a wide range of regulatory offences.In 2017, the agencies jointly conducted more than 350 operations against peddlers of sexual enhancement drugs and illegal medicines, resulting in over 50 peddlers caught and seizures of about 735,000 units of such products with an estimated street value of about S$2 million. Under the Health Products Act, offenders caught supplying adulterated health products are liable upon conviction to a fine not exceeding S$100,000 or to imprisonment not exceeding three years or to both. Foreign offenders caught peddling such sexual enhancement drugs and illegal medicines are repatriated and prohibited from re-entry into Singapore.The Police have also installed more cameras and improved the lighting in Geylang. A total of 171 additional cameras have been installed since 2015. This is a four times increase from the 47 cameras in 2014. The increased street lighting and wider network of cameras have enhanced the deterrence and detection of illicit activities in the area, including at the junction of Aljunied Road and Geylang Road.We will continue our tough enforcement approach against illegal activities in Geylang, and further step up as necessary."
ban of smartphones in schools,"Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Education whether smartphones should be banned in schools given that there are studies showing their detrimental effects on students' learning, interaction, school-related work, physical activity, along with other smartphone-related disruptions.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: MOE has provided guidance for schools to develop policies and rules to regulate the use of mobile devices in schools, based on their student profiles and needs. However, there is no blanket ban of smartphones in schools. There have been recent reports that countries such as France, Australia and the UK are considering banning smartphones in schools. But there are conflicting views in these countries on the usefulness or practicality of a blanket ban. While there are studies that show the detrimental effects of smartphones on learning, there are also studies which show that when used purposefully, phones are learning tools that can bring about positive educational outcomes. For example, students can use their smartphones to obtain useful information, conduct research, collaborate with their classmates and provide teachers with quick feedback on their understanding of lessons. Whether smartphones affect learning positively or negatively depends on its usage. Schools are therefore teaching students to use mobile devices responsibly both in and out of school. Through Cyber Wellness (CW) lessons, students are taught how to take responsibility for their online well-being. They are also taught to seek help from trusted adults when necessary. As partners-in-education, parents also play an important role in guiding their children in the use of smartphones and online interactions. MOE will continue to monitor developments and work closely with schools to put in place measures and structures pertaining to smartphones to ensure a conducive teaching and learning environment."
remedial steps to improve workplace safety by pie viaduct collapse contractor,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether Or Kim Peow Contractors has demonstrated that they have taken remedial steps to improve its workplace safety and health standards; (b) whether the company is still under the Business Under Surveillance programme; and (c) whether the Ministry has inspected all the company's worksites to check if the incident in July 2017 reflects a wider systemic failure of its safety management or a deterioration of its safety standards.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: Or Kim Peow Contractors (Private) Limited (“OKP”) was placed on the Business Under Surveillance (“BUS”) programme on 19 July 2017 and is still being monitored under the programme. OKP has developed an action plan as part of BUS, and MOM will be working with OKP to monitor the implementation of the plan. Since the 14 July 2017 accident, MOM has carried out inspections at all worksites under OKP to ensure compliance with safety and health standards. MOM will continue to inspect OKP’s worksites under the BUS programme. As OKP is currently facing a charge under the WSH Act in relation to the 14 July 2017 accident, it is not appropriate for the Ministry to comment on the existence or otherwise of systemic safety failures in the company. "
proposal to tighten regulations for users of personal mobility devices,Mr Seah Kian Peng asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry will consider tightening regulations for all PMD users including compulsory licensing of all users and mandatory public insurance coverage to be taken up by all users.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: In February this year, the Active Mobility Advisory Panel (AMAP) recommended introducing a registration regime for e-scooters. AMAP also recommended that there is currently no need to mandate registration of other types of PMDs, such as electric hoverboards and unicycles, as their usage is less widespread and their speeds are lower when used. The Government has accepted these recommendations. LTA will be introducing the mandatory e-scooter registration regime from early next year. AMAP is also currently reviewing the active mobility insurance and compensation framework, including the option of compulsory third party insurance. The Panel will weigh the need for this against the impact on the large majority of responsible users. It will also take into account the practices of other jurisdictions. The Panel will complete its review and publish its recommendations by the end of the year. "
trend of cord blood donation by minority races,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the trend of cord blood donation by minority races over the past five years; and (b) whether there are any plans by the Ministry to encourage minority races to donate cord blood.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong:  Currently, there are four licensed cord blood banks in Singapore. Three are private cord blood banks while the Singapore Cord Blood Bank (SCBB) was set up by our public healthcare cluster SingHealth. Over the past five years, the SCBB received about 4,000 donations annually. 69% of the cord blood donations were made by Chinese, 9% by Malays, 9% by Indians and the rest were by donors of other ethnicity. SCBB has programmes to encourage and raise awareness on cord blood donations, including those tailored for the minority communities. For the Malay community, for example, SCBB has worked with MUIS to issue a set of commonly asked question on cord blood donations by Muslims to address the concerns of the community. SCBB will continue work with our stakeholders and partners to reach out to the various communities. "
flexi flats returned to hdb after demise of owners,Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for National Development as of June 2018 (a) how many 2-room flexi flats sold to elderly Singaporeans have been returned to HDB due to the demise of the owner; and (b) how soon are these flats put on sale again; and (c) whether HDB informs buyers that these flats are pre-owned units.,"Mr Lawrence Wong:  Under the 2-room Flexi scheme, elderly Singaporeans can buy a 2-room Flexi flat on a shorter lease of 15 to 45 years. From August 2015, when the scheme was introduced, till June 2018, 3 short-lease flats have been returned to HDB due to the demise of the elderly owner. HDB puts the returned flats that are ready for sale in the next available Sale of Balance Flats (SBF) exercise, where they are indicated as “repurchased flats”. This information is also provided in the invitation package provided to shortlisted applicants before the selection appointments."
"proposal for mrt stations for along cross island line at fernvale, sengkang, hougang and buangkok","Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Transport whether LTA has completed the study of possible MRT stations for the Cross Island Line and whether it can include having stations in Fernvale, Sengkang, Hougang and Buangkok.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Engineering studies for the Cross Island Line are currently on-going. In determining locations for new MRT stations, LTA takes into account various factors, such as land use plans, transport needs for the areas concerned, as well as construction safety and feasibility. LTA will announce the locations of the stations after the completion of the engineering studies. "
ability of hdb flats to withstand decay and strong winds and rain,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for National Development (a) how well-equipped are today's HDB flats for withstanding strong winds and rain; and (b) whether regular inspections are done on structures which may be prone to decay from dampness.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: In designing and constructing HDB flats, HDB ensures that all its buildings, including the external facade features, are designed to resist forces due to wind and rain, and conform to the approved Codes of Practice, the Building Control Act and Regulations and Statutory requirements. Durable materials such as reinforced concrete, aluminum and stainless steel are used. Inspections are also done during construction to make sure the works are done properly. In the case of claddings and fixtures, these are usually designed and inspected by a Specialist Qualified Person. Post-construction, there are various inspection regimes in place to ensure HDB buildings are well maintained and remain structurally sound. For example, the Periodic Structural Inspection (PSI) regime that ensures that buildings are regularly checked for structural defects, so that these can be rectified early to keep the buildings structurally safe for continued occupation.  For HDB building facades, Town Councils are responsible for their maintenance under the Town Councils Act. The Town Councils conduct regular visual inspections on the building facades, and where necessary, engage a Qualified Person to follow up on the repairs. In addition, HDB conducts annual audit inspections of selected blocks, with a focus on buildings with more façade elements. These various regulatory and inspection regimes have ensured our HDB buildings are safe. Nevertheless, no regime is 100% foolproof. We will continue to review our policies and benchmark against other high-rise high-density cities to identify areas for improvement. Everyone has a role to play in ensuring a safe living environment. We therefore also encourage residents to report any defects or potential issues to the relevant authorities. "
support for non-profit organisations promoting lifelong employability of seniors,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Manpower what support is given to non-profit organisations promoting the lifelong employability of seniors and how is the Ministry looking to enhance this support for the aging workforce.,"Mrs Josephine Teo:  To stay employable, seniors must have relevant skills which should be continually upgraded to keep pace with the changing needs of industry. To this end, the Government provides funding support for a broad range of continuing education and training (CET) programmes. For example, through the SkillsFuture Mid-Career Enhanced Subsidy, there are courses pre-approved by the Ministry of Education (MOE) and SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG). These include Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ) courses provided by non-profit organisations, such as Tsao Foundation’s Hua Mei Training Academy. MOM also promotes progressive workplace practices for seniors. For instance, Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF) is a key programme partner for grants such as WorkPro, which encourages employers to redesign and adapt their work processes and jobs to appeal to older workers, and for older workers to continue to be productive in their workplaces. In addition, MOM has initiatives that improve older workers’ employability more directly. The Special Employment Credit (SEC) Scheme provides wage offsets to employers that hire older workers aged 55 and above, earning up to $4,000. Under the Adapt and Grow initiative, MOM supports the job search efforts of older workers. The Professional Conversion Programmes and Career Support Programme provide training and salary support to help older PMETs overcome skills and wage mismatches. Non-profit organisations that partner the Government in the delivery of programmes and services to seniors can receive direct or indirect funding support. For example, the Government supports Fei Yue Family Service Centre in the running of the Family Central’s Elder Education Department to help senior citizens pursue lifelong learning."
projects undertaken by pie viaduct collapse contractor,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Transport (a) how many projects are currently undertaken by Or Kim Peow Contractors; (b) what measures are in place to ensure that these projects meet the workplace safety standards; (c) whether there is a need to strengthen the supervision of these projects and to review them for safety considerations; (d) whether there will be follow-up actions with the consultancy firms implicated in the collapse of the PIE viaduct in Upper Changi in July 2017; and (e) how does the Ministry ensure that the consultancy firms and consultants perform their roles responsibly.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The Land Transport Authority (LTA) has reached an agreement with Or Kim Peow Contractors (Pte) Ltd (OKP) to mutually terminate the contract to construct the TPE-PIE Changi Viaduct. LTA has also appointed an independent Professional Engineer to assess the structural adequacy of the viaduct, and will be demolishing any structures that are deemed unsafe, including all the crossheads. OKP has two other contracts with LTA to design and construct covered linkways near MRT stations, LRT stations and bus interchanges under the Walk2Ride Programme. Following the accident last July, LTA has stepped up regular checks and inspections on the worksites to ensure that works are done safely. LTA has not found any non-compliance with our safety standards at these worksites. LTA will continue to work closely with its contractors to ensure that they comply with workplace safety and health requirements. This includes appointing site supervisors to oversee the daily operations at worksites, and monthly and ad-hoc inspections. LTA also organises regular dialogues and workplace safety trainings with the contractors’ management and staff. The consultancy firms implicated in the incident will be replaced. The consultants are also facing charges under the Building Control Act and the Workplace Safety and Health Act. LTA carefully assesses consultancy firms’ past performance in all government contracts when evaluating tender bids."
increasing incidents of fires involving personal mobility devices,Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked the Minister for National Development (a) how is the Ministry addressing the increasing incidents of personal mobility device fires; (b) what is being done to enhance fire safety measures especially in estates where there are many elderly residents; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider installing sprinklers in new BTO estates.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB blocks are designed to comply with the prevailing Fire Code when they are built. All HDB flats are designed as fire compartments, with concrete walls and floors that help to prevent the spread of fire beyond or into the unit. HDB carries out regular reviews of fire safety in HDB blocks, and has enhanced fire safety provisions for older blocks over the years, such as through providing fire-rated doors to the main entrances of flats, as well as installing rising mains and fire lifts to facilitate fire-fighting. Sprinklers are currently provided in certain areas of HDB buildings as required by the Fire Code, such as some basement car parks, as well as some commercial and social communal facilities. SCDF’s assessment at this point in time is that there is no need to install sprinklers within the residential units. At the end of the day, what is most important is fire prevention. Residents who intend to use personal mobility devices (PMD) should exercise caution by only buying such devices from reputable sources, and avoid overcharging their batteries or tampering with the electrical components. The Land Transport Authority is also working with relevant stakeholders to study if safety requirements can be imposed on motorised PMDs to mitigate potential fire risks."
proposal to review specialist training under accreditation council for graduate medical education,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked ask the Minister for Health (a) whether there will be a review of the current specialist training under the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME); (b) whether the Ministry is ready to customise and evolve the specialist training programme to suit our specific needs; and (c) how will the specialist training programme be aligned with the call to have more generic specialists to meet our population's needs.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong:  The current ACGME International (ACGME-I) accredited medical postgraduate training system was introduced in Singapore in 2010 to bring about more systematic and consistent training for medical specialists. Compared to the former apprenticeship training method, the system provides trainee doctors, who are called “residents”, better defined training objectives and competencies, more structured curriculum and regular formative assessments. In 2014, MOH reviewed the training model and concluded that it was meeting our overall objectives. The review also identified areas for improvement, one of which was to contextualise the model to better suit our specific needs. MOH has been working on the recommended improvements and contextualisation. For example, to better prepare our medical specialists for our ageing population, we are providing our specialists with broader competencies for more holistic care delivery. From next year, doctors will start their specialist training after completing a generic postgraduate year one (PGY1) training. A mandatory geriatric medicine modular training programme has also been instituted as part of residency training for all non-Internal Medicine residents. We will continue to engage and take in the inputs of our stakeholders, including our healthcare institutions, medical community and ACGME-I, and make refinements to our training framework to better meet local needs."
"design pmd rules to keep elderly, younger and disabled pedestrians safe","Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Transport how are the PMD rules designed to keep pedestrians, especially children, elderly and those with disabilities, safe on walkways and parks and how effective have they been in reducing the number of accidents so far.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The current rules regulating the safety of our public paths were developed by the Active Mobility Advisory Panel after a large scale public consultation exercise in 2015. These include speed limits on footpaths and shared paths, regulations against reckless riding, and restrictions on the speed, weight and dimensions of devices used on public paths. A code of conduct has also been introduced to guide cyclists and PMD users on how to share paths safely with each other. These regulations are coupled with strict enforcement and extensive education efforts. LTA and the Panel will continually review if these regulations are relevant and sufficient. The Panel is currently reviewing the speed limits on footpaths, the behaviour of active mobility users at road crossings, the usage of helmets by active mobility users, and the insurance and compensation framework for active mobility. The Panel will release its recommendations by the end of the year. Ultimately, it is also the individual responsibility of the cyclist or PMD user to have basic respect and consideration for their fellow path users. This will go a long way in ensuring that Singaporeans can continue to use and share our paths safely."
adherence to national wages council guidelines as qualifying criterion for companies to be eligible for government funding,Ms K Thanaletchimi asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Ministry will consider making the National Wages Council (NWC) guidelines an important qualifying criteria for companies to be considered for funding under the Transform and Grow and Adapt and Grow initiatives.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: The National Wage Council (NWC) guidelines may be voluntarily adopted by companies, depending on their circumstances. The tripartite partners have consistently taken this approach, to recognise that companies vary in their ability to afford the recommended wage increases or payments. Requiring the adoption of the guidelines as a criterion to access government support schemes, whether administered by Workforce Singapore or other agencies, would be inconsistent with this approach. Instead, the NWC carefully considers inputs from the unions, employers and Government representatives, to ensure that its recommendations are well-balanced. Outreach efforts by both the Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF) and the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) are also critical in promoting the adoption of the guidelines."
"minimum age for users of electric bicycles, e-scooters and pmds","Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Transport whether, for safety reasons, the Government will consider setting a minimum age limit of 18 for all users of electric bikes, e-scooters and other types of PMDs.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: There is a minimum age requirement of 16 years to register and use power-assisted bicycles (PABs). This applies to both riders and pillion passengers on PABs, as PABs travel on roads alongside larger vehicles such as cars. There is no minimum age limit for all personal mobility devices (PMDs), including e-scooters, which cannot be used on roads and can only travel on off-road paths. Rather than banning the young from using such devices, it is more important to educate them about safe riding habits, which is why LTA is engaging with schools to roll out the Safe Riding Programme. "
allowing first-timers to buy hdb bto and new flats without income ceiling,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry can review the relevant policies to allow all first-timers to buy HDB BTO and new flats without any income ceiling.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB is committed to helping Singaporeans, particularly first-timers and lower to middle-income families, to own a home. The income ceiling helps to ensure that housing subsidies are given to those who need them most. At the current income ceiling of $12,000, the majority of citizen households, or about eight in 10, are able to buy a subsidised flat. Households with a monthly income above $12,000 have other housing options. For example, those earning up to $14,000 may buy an Executive Condominium unit from property developers. There is no income ceiling restriction to buy a resale HDB flat on the open market."
accuracy of national service’s physical employment standards system,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Defence what measures are or will be taken to ensure accuracy in the Physical Employment Standards (PES) system in National Service where the recommendation to downgrade comes from a private medical practitioner.,"Dr Ng Eng Hen: National Servicemen are assigned a Physical Employment Standard or PES based on their medical condition. The assigned PES grade helps the SAF determine the type of vocations that are compatible with the serviceman’s medical condition. The PES grade is first assigned to the serviceman at the Central Manpower Base as part of pre-enlistment medical screening. This is based on a review of serviceman’s medical history, including pre-existing medical conditions, and a medical examination. Servicemen are expected to declare any pre-existing medical conditions or diagnosis, and provide relevant information from their personal medical practitioners. Where needed, servicemen will be referred for further specialist assessment at a public restructured hospital. All this information is taken into account to ensure accuracy of his PES grading. A serviceman’s PES grading is updated as and when there are changes to his medical condition or health status, to ensure that his PES grade is accurate. A PES grade re-assignment is undertaken by the SAF Medical Board through an objective and thorough review process. The SAF Medical Board is chaired by a senior regular Medical Officer, holding the rank of MAJ or LTC, with two other Medical Officers. Where the servicemen’s medical condition are complex and requires further specialist opinion, these cases will be referred to the Specialist Medical Board. Specialist Medical Boards are chaired by a SAF Medical Officer who holds the rank of LTC and is a certified medical specialist. The board also includes a civilian senior medical specialist who is appointed by the SAF to provide objective specialist advice. Medical assessments of our servicemen made by medical practitioners in both the private and public sector will be considered objectively by Medical Officers in the SAF, and are not treated differently. While these medical practitioners may make recommendations for changes to a serviceman’s PES grade based on his clinical diagnosis, his final PES grade will take into account the operational context and requirements of the SAF, thus ensuring that each serviceman will contribute optimally during his National Service."
recourse for victims of hit-and-run e-scooter accidents,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the recourse for pedestrians after they are being knocked down by a e-scooter and the rider has fled the scene; and (b) whether LTA will introduce compulsory third party insurance for e-scooters to protect pedestrians.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Under the Active Mobility Act, a cyclist or rider of personal mobility device (PMD) involved in an accident on a public path must stop to render assistance and provide his or her name and address to the injured person. Those who fail to do so will be liable, upon conviction for a fine of up to $3,000, or imprisonment of up to 12 months, or both. Repeat offenders would be liable for higher penalties. Depending on the circumstances of the case, the cyclist or PMD rider may also be charged for speeding or reckless behaviour under the Active Mobility Act or for causing hurt to others by a rash act under the Penal Code. Persons involved in hit-and-run accidents with cyclists and PMD riders should immediately file a police report. To deter errant cyclists and PMD riders, LTA will also be introducing a mandatory registration regime for e-scooters by early next year. Under this regime, all e-scooter owners will need to provide their personal particulars as part of the registration process, and paste identification stickers prominently on their devices. This will facilitate easy identification and enforcement against hit-and-run accidents. The Active Mobility Advisory Panel is reviewing the active mobility insurance and compensation framework, including the option of compulsory third party insurance. The Panel will weigh the need for this against the impact on the large majority of responsible users and also take into account the practices of other jurisdictions. The Panel will complete its review and publish its recommendations by the end of the year. "
top-up of ez-link cards at passenger service centre of mrt stations,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Transport (a) why are EZ Link cardholders not allowed to top up their cards at the Passenger Service Centre (PSC) in MRT stations; (b) whether LTA is aware that not all MRT stations have General Ticketing Machines (GTM) for cardholders to top up; and (c) why is there no notes changing service at the PSC for commuters and tourists those who do not want to top up $50 on their fare card.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: All MRT and LRT stations have General Ticketing Machines (GTM) which accept cash top-ups in all common note denominations. Hence, Passenger Service Centres (PSC) do not provide cash top-ups. We encourage commuters to adopt e-payment modes at the GTMs. With e-payment, commuters can avoid the hassle of preparing exact change for cash top-ups or queuing to withdraw cash from ATMs. It has also allowed PSC staff to focus on their core function of ensuring smooth and safe operations at our rail stations. This will help our operators provide better service in an efficient manner. "
boosting competitiveness of singapore as aircraft leasing hub,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether an update can be provided on measures to boost the competitiveness of Singapore as an aircraft leasing hub vis-à-vis countries like Hong Kong and Ireland.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing:  Currently, around 40% of commercial aircrafts used by airlines are leased rather than directly purchased, and the size of the global aircraft leasing industry stands at US$261 billion. Driven by a burgeoning middle class and increasing air connectivity in the Asia-Pacific region, the total number of commercial aircraft is expected to more than double by 2036. This represents a significant business opportunity for aircraft lessors.Ireland has been a pioneer in aircraft leasing since the 1970s, and continues to capture the largest global market share at 65%. Singapore is the top aircraft leasing hub in Asia-Pacific with 20% global market share. Today, we host operations for eight of the top ten aircraft leasing companies. Nonetheless, we are keenly aware of the strong competition. Hong Kong for instance is stepping up in aircraft leasing, buoyed by the increase in air travel from China, and aspires to expand its market share to 18% in twenty years’ time2. Singapore’s strong reputation as a major aircraft leasing hub is founded on several factors. First, we have an extensive network of Avoidance of Double Taxation Agreements (DTAs) with more than 80 jurisdictions, including growing Asian markets such as China, India, and Vietnam.Second, Singapore’s strong financial industry, together with our growing professional services ecosystem of law firms, banks and tax advisory firms, provide support and financing options to the aircraft leasing business, making us an attractive base for the top aircraft lessors in the world. Companies looking to develop aircraft leasing capabilities in Singapore may also avail of the Aircraft Leasing Scheme, which provides concessionary tax rates on qualifying income from leasing of aircraft or aircraft engines. The professional services Industry Transformation Map (ITM), launched in January this year, will further support various industries, including aircraft leasing, as we enhance capabilities and spur greater innovation in our professional services firms.Third, our aircraft leasing industry is complemented by deep knowledge and strong support from our aviation and aerospace industries. Changi Airport is one of the busiest airports in the world, and we have an established base of aerospace companies and talent to provide quality maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) services to support key aviation players, including lessors. The aerospace ITM, also launched in January, will chart our efforts to transform our aerospace industry and strengthen our MRO sector. Even as we are doing relatively well today, we need to continue to work with stakeholders to nurture a comprehensive aviation and aerospace ecosystem, and a robust financial sector critical for aircraft leasing activities. By ensuring our competitiveness as Asia’s aircraft leasing hub, the industry will continue to generate economic spin-offs and good jobs to benefit Singaporeans. "
employment assistance for fresh graduates from private universities,Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Ministry has plans to assist fresh graduates from private universities to gain employment in the workforce and to change the perception of their value-add to the market place amongst employers.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: To help graduates from private education institutions (PEIs) secure good employment outcomes, PEIs must equip graduates with industry-relevant skills and take responsibility for the employment outcomes of their graduates. This is why MOE regularly highlights to PEIs the importance of maintaining the relevance of their programmes to meet the changing needs of industry and potential employers, and why PEIs offering degree programmes are assessed via the EduTrust scheme on their graduate outcomes. MOE is also helping our students make better informed decisions in the career and learning journey. We have: (a) stepped up Education and Career Guidance (ECG) efforts in schools; and (b) made it mandatory for PEIs with degree programmes to conduct and publish the PEI Graduate Employment Survey, which is similar to the Graduate Employment Survey by the autonomous universities.Increasingly, employers look beyond education qualifications to identify candidates with good fit. Together with our tripartite partners, MOM also promotes progressive hiring practices which encourage firms to assess candidates holistically, including through the use of competency assessment tools or work trials where appropriate. These practices are outlined in the Tripartite Standard on Recruitment Practices which was launched in November last year. Employers which voluntarily sign up to the Standard commit to adopt fair, merit-based and inclusive recruitment practices. As of June this year, more than 560 employers, accounting for about 340,000 workers, have adopted this Standard. "
traffic impact assessment for construction of staging ground at marina east,Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether a traffic impact assessment had been carried out prior to having the construction staging ground located at Marina East; and (b) when will this temporary staging ground be relocated.,"Mr Lawrence Wong:  The temporary occupation licence (TOL) for the construction staging ground at Marina East was first issued to LTA in 2014, before activities in the area generated significant traffic impact. In 2016, arising from new TOL applications in the East Coast/Marina Bay area, a joint Traffic Impact Assessment (TIA) was carried out for the TOLs in the East Coast/Marina Bay area, as they share the same access road. The Marina East staging ground is segregated from the existing residential area by East Coast Parkway and East Coast Park. Nevertheless, LTA has adopted measures to minimise dis-amenities to road users in the vicinity. For example, queue bays are provided in the staging ground, and throughput has been enhanced so that heavy vehicles do not overflow into public roads. LTA is also working closely with the developers and contractors in the area to develop localised traffic control plans to improve safety and minimise inconvenience to other road users. These include managing the schedules and routes of heavy vehicles to avoid peak hour traffic and residential areas, where possible. There are also signs to alert motorists to slow down and watch out for heavy vehicles.From a land-use perspective, the Marina East staging ground currently supports LTA’s rail and road infrastructure projects. When these projects are completed, we will review whether to continue the use of this staging ground, in connection with the timing of future development plans for the area. "
impact of rising minimum fixed monthly salary required for employment pass and s pass holders,Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked the Minister for Manpower in light of the rising minimum fixed monthly salary required for employment pass and S-pass holders for the bringing of family members on dependant passes (a) whether this discourages the hiring of cheap foreign talent and favours expensive foreign talent; (b) how many employment pass holders and their families affected; and (c) how many SMEs and which sectors are most affected by this.,"Mrs Josephine Teo:  The qualifying salary threshold for bringing in dependants on Dependant’s Pass is regularly updated. This is to ensure that Employment Pass (EP) and S Pass holders continue to be able to upkeep themselves and their dependants in Singapore. To minimise disruptions to families who are already here in Singapore, Dependant’s Passes issued before the updated threshold takes effect remains valid, as long as the main pass holder remains with the same employer.Most new EP and S Pass holders do not apply to bring in their dependants. However, for those who do, the salary thresholds are made known and consistently applied. Following the increase in qualifying threshold at the beginning of the year, about 1% of Dependant’s Pass applications did not meet the updated threshold and were therefore rejected, in the first half of 2018. These were distributed across sectors such as Professional Services, Infocomm and Construction. The rate of rejection was similar for those employed by SMEs and non-SMEs.  "
purchase of hdb flats while retaining ownership of local or overseas private properties,"Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for National Development (a) currently, how many Singaporeans are allowed to purchase resale HDB flats while retaining ownership of local or overseas private properties; (b) under what circumstances will HDB allow a waiver of its rule which is to dispose the private property within six months from buying a resale flat; and (c) whether this policy has achieved its intended outcome of cooling the property market.","Mr Lawrence Wong:  HDB flats are meant for owner-occupation. To reinforce this principle, buyers of HDB resale flats are not allowed to retain ownership of local or overseas private properties.However, on a case-by-case basis, HDB will consider appeals from flat owners to retain private properties, taking into account factors such as the owner’s share in the private property, and why the private property cannot be recovered for his own use. This policy has achieved its objective of dampening demand for resale flats from buyers with no urgent housing need. Together with other cooling measures introduced since 2009, it has helped to stabilise prices in the resale market and to ensure that HDB flats remain affordable to Singaporeans.  "
making available judgments of employment claims tribunal accessible,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Minister for Manpower whether judgments and grounds of decision of the Employment Claims Tribunal can be made available for access and reference.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: Today, any individual may request for a copy of the judgment or grounds of decision by the Employment Claims Tribunals (ECT), including both parties and non-parties to the proceedings. In assessing requests, the ECT will consider factors such as whether the information requested is necessary for the administration of justice, whether it is necessary to fulfil a legal requirement, or any other legitimate reason. This practice is consistent with applications for judgments and grounds of decisions of the State Courts, including other tribunals such as the Small Claims Tribunals. The Ministry of Manpower will make applications to the ECT to publish the judgment and grounds of decision for cases that are useful references to parties, including employers, employees and mediators. This will promote greater awareness of employment laws, as interpreted by the courts."
number of errant users of personal mobility devices caught since commencement of active mobility act,"Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar asked the Minister for Transport from October 2017 to May 2018 (a) how many accidents involving electric scooters or electric-powered PMDs have there been; (b) how many involved serious injuries to pedestrians which required hospitalisation; and (c) whether there are plans to further regulate the use of electric scooters or electric-powered PMDs especially the allowable speeds and usage, testing, licensing and age requirements of the riders.","71 Ms Tin Pei Ling asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the number of errant PMD users caught and taken to task since the commencement of the Active Mobility Act; (b) what is the profile of these errant users; and (c) what other efforts will be undertaken by the Government to improve awareness of the Act to better safeguard public safety.Mr Khaw Boon Wan: In 2017, there were a total of 128 reported accidents on public paths involving personal mobility devices (PMDs). Unfortunately, 9 of these resulted in major injuries.The Active Mobility Act (AMA) empowers LTA to enforce against active mobility offences. LTA’s Active Mobility Enforcement Officers have stepped up efforts to strictly enforce against active mobility offences such as the riding of non-compliant devices, reckless riding and speeding. Since the AMA commenced on 1 May 2018, 297 errant PMD users between the ages of 14 and 80 have been caught for active mobility-related offences. Those who are found guilty of active mobility offences are liable for fines and/or imprisonment. Those caught riding non-compliant devices may also have their devices seized and forfeited.LTA will introduce a mandatory registration regime for e-scooters from early next year. This will help deter reckless behaviour and facilitate members of public and our enforcement officers in identifying and tracking down errant users.The Active Mobility Advisory Panel (AMAP) is also reviewing the active mobility regulations, including the speed limit on footpaths, the behaviour of active mobility users at road crossings, the usage of helmets by active mobility device users, and the insurance and compensation framework. AMAP will release its recommendations by the end of this year.LTA has also stepped up efforts to further improve awareness of the rules and code of conduct governing active mobility usage, including launching publicity campaigns in different languages, leveraging on Active Mobility Patrol volunteers to engage the public on safe and gracious path-sharing behaviours, and launching the Safe Riding Programme.I urge all cyclists and PMD users to show respect and consideration for their fellow path users. This will go a long way in ensuring that Singaporeans can continue to share our paths safely and harmoniously."
lower speed limits for personal mobility devices on footpaths,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Transport in view of the potential severe personal injuries that can be sustained in a collision between PMDs and pedestrians (a) whether the speed limit of PMDs on footpaths and cycling/shared paths should be lowered; and (b) whether the maximum device speed of electric and motorised PMDs should also be lowered.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Cyclists and personal mobility device (PMD) users are subject to a speed limit of 15km/h on footpaths, and 25km/h on cycling and shared paths. For motorised PMDs, there is a device speed limit of 25km/h.The Active Mobility Advisory Panel (AMAP) is currently reviewing some active mobility regulations, including the speed limit on footpaths, and will release its recommendations later this year. The speed limit on shared and cycling paths is not under review as such paths are much wider and there have been far fewer accidents occurring on them. Thus, we will maintain the maximum device speed of PMDs at 25km/h, which is the maximum speed they can travel on cycling and shared paths."
legislation to prohibit use of personal mobility devices for carrying young children as passengers,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry will consider introducing legislation which explicitly prohibits the use of personal mobility devices for carrying young children as passengers.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan:  Personal mobility devices (PMDs) have been a convenient mode of first-and-last-mile transport for many Singaporeans, and some of them are designed to carry passengers. Rather than banning the carrying of young children as passengers, it is more important for all PMD users to take responsibility for riding safely. PMD users should not carry more passengers than the PMD is designed to carry, and should ride slowly to ensure safety for themselves, their passengers, and other path users."
placement of children with special needs in mainstream schools,Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Education (a) what are the efforts to support placement of children with special needs in mainstream schools apart from deploying allied educators; (b) whether there is a comprehensive training plan for teachers in mainstream schools to cope with special needs students; (c) whether there are protocols to guide mainstream schools on the sharing of information between teachers and staff on caring for special needs students; and (d) whether briefing sessions for mainstream students can be arranged to improve their understanding of special needs for better integration with such students studying in their midst.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung:  Depending on their needs, students with Special Education Needs (SEN) in mainstream schools receive various support. These include specialised support programmes and services, such as assistive technological devices to support the integration and learning needs of students with visual, hearing or physical impairments and itinerant school-based services from Voluntary Welfare Organisations. They are also supported by specialised personnel such as teachers trained in special needs (TSNs), psychologists who provide consultation and advice, and Allied Educators.In addition, schools have teams that oversee SEN support in a systemic way to facilitate the learning experiences of students with mild SEN in mainstream schools. As students’ build their coping strategies, they can typically progress through the system with little or even no support services. Since 2005, teacher trainees have been provided with a basic understanding on supporting students with SEN and learning differences during their pre-service training at NIE. MOE has also been equipping a core group of teachers in all schools with deeper knowledge and skills in supporting the teaching and learning of students with special needs, through the TSN training programme, a certificate level training in SEN. MOE is also building up the numbers of Senior Teachers in SEN. Teachers and Allied Educators regularly share strategies and skills with each other to enable them to better support students with SEN. Form Teachers meet frequently with their Year Heads to discuss the needs of their students including those with SEN and how they can be supported. In addition, MOE Psychologists and VWOs provide consultation and conduct teacher training and customised workshops, to build the capacity of school staff to support students with SEN.We will continue to provide more professional development opportunities for our teachers to build their competencies in supporting students with SEN in their schools.MOE has also developed a transition support framework. It provides guidelines for schools to facilitate a smoother transition for students with SEN across schools and levels. This framework covers guidance on the transfer of information as well, and includes rules on safeguarding confidentiality. These include obtaining parental consent for the transfer of information and sharing SEN-related information strictly on a need-to-know basis among relevant personnel. Teachers may also talk about a child’s needs with his peers, but they should avoid using labels such as the diagnosis.It is important that other mainstream students can empathise with students with SEN. Empathy building is one of the key socio-emotional competencies taught in Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) in schools. There are CCE lessons that raise awareness of disabilities and how each person can play a part in developing an inclusive society. Schools have also forged partnerships with VWOs and special education schools to provide opportunities for students to interact meaningfully and deepen mutual understanding."
details and framework of workings of the special needs trust company,"Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked the Minister for Social and Family Development what are the details and framework of the workings of The Special Needs Trust Company, in particular its objectives, potential partnerships and alignment with SG Enable.","Mr Desmond Lee: The Special Needs Trust Company is the only non-profit trust company in Singapore that provides affordable trust management services for persons with special needs. It is a registered Charity and an Institution of a Public Character.SNTC plays an important role in supporting caregivers in planning for the long-term financial and care needs of their dependants with special needs. Through SNTC’s trust and care planning services, caregivers can safeguard the monies they intend to leave behind for their special needs dependants.SNTC is backed by a team of Case Managers who work with the caregivers to develop a Care Plan for their special needs dependant. The Care Plan projects the amount to be set aside in the trust to provide for the dependant’s long-term needs. During the caregiver’s lifetime, SNTC will review the Care Plan with the caregiver to ensure its relevance to the evolving needs of the dependant. Following the demise or incapacity of the caregiver, SNTC will make home visits to check on the well-being of the dependant, monitor the trust funds and continue to review the Care Plan with the appointed caregiver.SNTC works with community partners including the Social Service Offices, to reach out to caregivers of persons with disabilities. It plans to partner more stakeholders, such as the special education (SPED) schools, hospitals, family service centres, the Institute of Financial Literacy and lawyers to educate caregivers on the importance of planning ahead for their loved ones with special needs. In addition, SNTC will be building networks with professionals such as financial advisors so as to better advise clients who have dependants with disabilities.SG Enable aims to help persons with disabilities find employment. It is also taking on the role of building a network of support for caregivers of persons with disabilities, without duplicating the roles played by existing disability service providers and SNTC.MSF will draw on synergies between SNTC and SG Enable in supporting caregivers. For instance, SNTC clients will be able to reach out to other caregivers at the SG Enable Caregivers’ Space at the Enabling Village, which will be set up by end 2018. Information on SNTC schemes is already available on SG Enable’s website.MSF also announced at this year’s Committee of Supply (COS) that ComCare applicants with disabilities will be able to get information on schemes and services for persons with disabilities, such as those offered by SNTC and SG Enable, at the Social Service Offices (SSOs) from the third quarter of this year. By the end of this year, the SSO at Geylang Serai will also pilot video-conferencing links with SNTC and SG Enable, so that ComCare applicants who are caregivers for persons with disabilities or who are themselves persons with disabilities will be able to consult SNTC and SG Enable staff without having to travel to SNTC’s or SG Enable’s offices unless necessary. "
problem of stray dogs and attacks on public,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for National Development (a) which are the areas where stray dogs have been reported but the problem has yet to be resolved; (b) whether there has been any reports of attacks by stray dogs on members of the public; and (c) how is AVA working with the various stakeholders to take concrete action to ensure public safety.,"Mr Lawrence Wong:  AVA receives feedback on different animals, including stray dogs, from various parts of Singapore. The majority of the feedback regarding stray dogs are about dog sightings and nuisance cases like barking.Upon receiving feedback about stray dogs, AVA conducts surveillance operations to assess public health and safety risks. If AVA determines that there are threats to public health and safety, for example when stray dogs have acted aggressively, AVA will remove the dogs. If found suitable, these dogs are offered to AVA’s Animal Welfare Group (AWG) partners for rehoming.  To address the issue of stray dogs holistically, AVA also takes upstream measures. First, AVA will take enforcement action against errant pet owners who abandon their dogs. A person found guilty of pet abandonment may be fined up to $10,000 and/or jailed up to 12 months. Second, AVA implemented a licensing-at-source scheme in 2017 to enhance the traceability of dogs and further discourage abandonment. Pet businesses must now license all dogs before they are sold. They must also transfer the licences to the new owners when any dog is sold or transferred. Third, AVA works with Town Councils, Government agencies, grassroots leaders, AWGs, and members of the public to raise awareness about responsible pet ownership, responsible community feeding, and to advise members of the public on what to do when they encounter stray dogs.Fourth, AVA intends to embark on a nationwide Trap-Neuter-Release-Manage (TNRM) programme later this year. This programme, in partnership with several AWGs, adopts a humane and science-based method to reduce the stray population through widespread sterilisation. After the dogs are sterilised, AVA will work with its AWG partners to rehome as many dogs as possible. Those that cannot be rehomed will be released at suitable locations to live out their lives naturally. Our target is to sterilise more than 70% of the stray dogs in Singapore within five years. If we are successful, this humane approach will result in a permanent reduction in the stray dog population after five years."
temporary occupation licences issued to commercial plant operators in east coast/ marina bay area,Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for Law (a) how many temporary occupation licences (TOLs) have been issued to commercial plant operators in the East Coast/Marina Bay area; (b) what is the purpose of issuing such TOLs; and (c) whether any traffic impact assessments or environment impact assessments have been carried out before the TOLs were issued.,"Mr K Shanmugam:  Temporary Occupation Licences (TOLs) are issued by the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) for the temporary use of State land. Common temporary uses include the use of State land for community events or to support public infrastructure projects.As of 31 May 2018, a total of 13 TOLs have been issued in the East Coast/Marina Bay area for commercial plant operations. These comprise mainly concrete batching plants that support works carried out by contractors undertaking various public infrastructure projects, including the development of the Thomson-East Coast Line and the North South Corridor, which are critical transport infrastructure developments.SLA works with the relevant Government agencies, such as the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and National Environment Agency (NEA), to assess all TOL applications. Factors such as the need and urgency of the project, traffic and environmental impact, and availability of alternative sites are taken into consideration. Government agencies work with TOL operators to minimise potential dis-amenities. For example, the concrete batching plants in the East Coast/Marina Bay area are required to maintain a buffer from nearby residential premises to minimise nuisance from noise and dust. A Traffic Impact Assessment on the TOL sites at Marina East was also carried out, and two signalised junctions were implemented in the area to ensure smooth and safe traffic. There may still be instances where some traffic or environmental impact on users of nearby areas is unavoidable. In such cases, Government agencies will work with the TOL operators and stakeholders to implement suitable mitigation measures. With regard to the TOLs  issued in the East Coast/Marina Bay area, monthly stakeholder meetings are held to address any issues which require immediate attention, such as ground pollution. If TOL operators fail to implement the required mitigation measures satisfactorily, warning letters will be issued. In cases involving recalcitrant operators, the TOLs may be rescinded."
lengthen time for student movement between classes,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Education whether the Ministry can lengthen the time for student movement between classes to give students more time to get to their class and settle down as rushing from class to class causes anxiety and reduces concentration during lesson time.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung:  Schools plan students’ daily time-table with their well-being as an important consideration. Hence, they incorporate sufficient breaks and constrain the length of school day, while ensuring adequate time for learning. An increase in the time for student movement between classes will lead to school days ending later. Teachers are mindful to end lessons on time for students to move to the next venue if need be, as well as allow the students to settle down before commencing the next lesson. Between class movement is usually not a source of student stress. Teachers are equipped to observe signs of stress in students and will provide the needed interventions if a case arises."
review licensing regimes to ensure singapore continues to be attractive location for work and play,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Home Affairs how is the Ministry evolving its licensing regimes to ensure that Singapore continues to develop into an attractive location for work and play without compromising on our public order.,"Mr K Shanmugam: To ensure Singapore remains an attractive place for work and leisure, public safety and order have to be maintained. MHA regulates activities which present risks to public safety, security, and law and order. MHA consults stakeholders such as ministries, industry associations and businesses when developing the regulations. We take into account business and other community interests, and adopt a calibrated, risk-based approach that is reviewed regularly.For example, nightclubs, bars and similar nightlife establishments are regulated under the Public Entertainments Act to maintain law and order, and public safety at these establishments. When the Public Entertainments Act was recently reviewed, we consulted extensively with the Singapore Nightlife Business Association. Their inputs were considered and taken in. For instance, in updating the demerit points regime under the Public Entertainments Act.But where there are law and order problems on the ground, MHA has a responsibility to act firmly. Due to a rise in violent crimes in Clarke Quay, we have, since 2013, restricted liquor licensing hours in Clarke Quay from 6 am to 3 am the day after on weekdays and 4 am the day after on weekends and the eve of Public Holidays.In addition to regulations, regular police patrols and enforcement, the Police also work with licensees and the community to promote responsible business operations and help maintain law and order. The Police, the Singapore Tourism Board and precinct stakeholders collaborated to make Clarke Quay a safer entertainment zone for patrons. Through this collaboration, Clarke Quay has strengthened training of security officers, improved sharing of information, and introduced a code of practice that sets out best practices for entertainment outlets, such as the serving of complimentary water to patrons who consume liquor to slow down the rate of intoxication, and bag checks.These efforts contributed to an improvement in the law and order situation in the precinct between 2013 and 2016. As a result of these improvements, we recalibrated the restrictions, and allowed extended hours on some Fridays each month, and for special events such as F1-related festivities. Where we can, we have taken in suggestions from our partners and relaxed the regulatory requirements, but public safety and order must always be our key priority.We monitor law and order closely and have noticed an increase in crimes such as fighting and drunkenness in Clarke Quay over the past year. This may be due to the increased number of patrons visiting Clarke Quay. We will continue to monitor the situation closely, make adjustments if necessary, and partner stakeholders to ensure that our city maintains its attractiveness without compromising on our public order."
promoting awareness of assistance for people with mental illnesses,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Health what is being done to make people with mental illnesses aware of the help they can receive including those who may have yet to be diagnosed due to fear of social stigma.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: There are various initiatives by the Government, as well as healthcare and community providers to proactively reach out to increase awareness of mental health conditions and provide information on avenues to seek help.In the school environment, HPB runs a series of psycho-emotional programmes to equip students with skills to manage stress and emotions, and collaborates with MOE to equip educators and school counsellors with skills to provide support in challenging times. Students needing greater support are referred to school counsellors and mental health professionals such as the Child Guidance Clinic at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH). Peer support structures are also being put in place in mainstream schools and Institutes of Higher Learning to support students in distress and encourage them to seek help early.To encourage a more supportive workplace environment for employees, HPB organises a workshop for managers to help them identify staff who are facing difficulties at work or may have mental health issues, as well as equip these managers with skills on how to approach, support and encourage staff to seek help early. In community settings, MOH and HPB conduct a series of healthy ageing workshops, which include tips on dementia and depression education to facilitate seeking help early. The Community Resource, Engagement and Support Teams (CREST), set up by the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC), reaches out to persons who may be at risk of mental health issues or dementia. CREST teams also provide mental health information and education to the public through their outreach activities. For persons screened to have mental health or dementia symptoms, the teams offer basic emotional support for them or their caregivers, and link them to appropriate services in the community.To reduce stigma of mental health conditions, the National Council of Social Service (NCSS) will be embarking on a multi-year public education campaign that aims to promote an inclusive society for persons with mental health issues, with support from Tote Board. This is in addition to NCSS’ publication of the Removing Barriers booklet on “Interacting with Persons with Mental Health Issues”.IMH also spearheads annual World Mental Health Day events and public forums, and collaborates with various Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs) and schools to promote understanding of mental health through a variety of activities and events. We will also continue to work with grassroots and community partners to empower the broader community to recognise residents at-risk, and better support them in the community.  "
security concerns arising from foreign workers and foreign domestic workers congregating in large numbers in public places,"Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is the Ministry's position on foreign workers and foreign domestic workers congregating in large numbers in public parks, shopping malls, cultural hubs and other specific areas; and (b) whether this is viewed with a changed perspective in this age of uncertainty.","K Shanmugam: The Police are generally concerned whenever very large crowds gather as the public safety and security risks are higher.In this context, the Police monitor areas with large congregations of foreign workers closely. They also conduct regular patrols and law enforcement operations in these areas, and there has not been any serious public order, or law and order issues in recent years.The vast majority of foreign workers in Singapore are law abiding, and do not engage in criminal or terrorism-related activities. MHA works closely with the Ministry of Manpower, employers, and community partners such as the Migrant Workers’ Centre, to advise foreign workers on Singapore’s multi-racial and religious setting, our social values, the dangers of radical ideology, and to abide by our laws."
implementing tripartite standards on managing workplace abuse and harassment,"Ms K Thanaletchimi asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether the Ministry will consider having tripartite standards on managing workplace abuse and harassment; and (b) if so, whether a review will be conducted to formulate the existing Tripartite Advisory on Managing Workplace Harassment as a set of guidelines.","Mrs Josephine Teo:  We take a multi-pronged approach in protecting employees from workplace harassment. The Protection from Harassment Act (POHA) was introduced in 2014, followed by the Tripartite Advisory on Managing Workplace Harassment in 2015.In October last year, the Tripartite Standard on Grievance Handling was introduced. This Standard specifies a set of verifiable and actionable employment practices that companies can follow to manage workplace grievances more effectively. Employers adopting this Standard are committed to putting in place clear processes for handling their employees’ grievances to ensure they are adequately dealt with. The same processes apply to grievances regarding workplace harassment. To date, more than 630 employers, which collectively employ about 380,000 employees, have pledged to uphold this Standard. We look forward to the strong support of our tripartite partners to promote adoption of the Standard to benefit more workers.We urge all employees who experience any workplace harassment to promptly report such incidents to their employers, so that the management can conduct proper investigations. Affected employees can also report such incidents to MOM or TAFEP, or seek redress through the Courts or Police. "
plans for heavy vehicle parking spaces in housing estates,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether he can provide an update on plans for heavy vehicle parking spaces in housing estates; (b) how many heavy vehicle parking spaces are there in Yishun; and (c) how many applicants are on the waitlist for season heavy vehicle parking lots in Nee Soon GRC.,"Mr Lawrence Wong:  On a nation-wide basis, the 42,280 heavy vehicle parking (HVP) spaces far exceed the 34,000 heavy vehicles registered with LTA. Today, around 30,000 of these HVP spaces are within 1km of residential estates. While heavy vehicle drivers prefer to park near where they live, other residents have raised safety and noise concerns arising from heavy vehicular traffic in residential areas. In addition, land near residential estates is needed for housing and community needs, making it difficult to continue providing heavy vehicle parks in residential estates.This is why, if and when existing public HVPs in residential estates are phased out due to development plans, they will be replaced with HVPs in industrial sites sold through the Government Land Sales programme near the area, where possible. Business owners should work out with their drivers the appropriate transport options to commute to work, especially for those who have to drive during the wee hours.There are 1,246 HVP spaces in and around Nee Soon GRC, of which 845 are public heavy vehicle parking spaces. All of these are subscribed with some 370 applicants on the waitlist."
top three sectors with highest number of salary-related dispute cases,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what are the current top three sectors with the highest number of salary-related dispute cases involving work permit holders; and (b) in how many of these cases are the salaries of the work permit holders paid electronically.,"Mrs Josephine Teo:  The Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM) handles salary-related dispute cases, including cases lodged by work permit holders. From its inception in April 2017 to December 2017, there were 3,100 salary claims involving work permit holders. The top three sectors with the most number of claims were Construction, Manufacturing, and Wholesale and Retail Trade, which accounted for 2,600 claims, or 83% of all salary claims. Of these 2,600 claims, 280 workers or 11% had their salaries paid electronically.Our laws already require employers of work permit holders to pay salaries electronically if their workers make the request. MOM has been facilitating the process of opening bank accounts for FWs during the Work Permit application process since 2014. In addition, MOM and our partners such as the Migrant Workers’ Centre (MWC) have been working to encourage salary payment through electronic means. A recently concluded survey conducted by MOM showed that 76% of foreign workers were paid electronically, higher than the 67% in 2014. We will continue to work with stakeholders to improve take-up rates, and also consult them on the option of mandating electronic salary payment. "
current affordability of current private and public housing compared with five years ago,Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for National Development how does the affordability of current private and public housing compare with that of the previous five years and with that of other leading international cities.,"Mr Lawrence Wong:  In the past five years, affordability in both the private and public housing markets has improved. Between end-2012 and end-2017, the median resident household income grew by 18.5%, whereas the prices of private residential properties, as reflected by URA’s Property Price Index, decreased by 8.4%. In the public housing market, the HDB Resale Price Index decreased by 9.6% over the same period. Enhancements to housing grants have also helped to improve affordability for both resale and new HDB flats.Based on the 2018 International Housing Affordability Survey by Demographia, the ratio of median residential property price to median annual household income was 4.8 for Singapore, as compared to 5.7 for New York, 8.5 for London, 12.9 for Sydney and 19.4 for Hong Kong. In recent quarters, we have seen a recovery in the private property market, while the HDB resale market has remained stable. We will continue to monitor market conditions closely, and will not hesitate to act when necessary to ensure a stable and sustainable property market."
consumption rate of pioneer generation fund,Mr Azmoon Ahmad asked the Minister for Finance (a) what is the annual consumption rate of the $8 billion Pioneer Generation Fund since its inception in March 2015; (b) what is the estimated number of Pioneer Generation individuals serviced under this fund; and (c) how long is the fund expected to last based on the current consumption rate.,"Mr Heng Swee Keat: About 450,000 Pioneers have benefited from the Pioneer Generation Package. As of May 2018, more than $1.3 billion has been disbursed from the Pioneer Generation Fund. This works out to an average of about $430 million disbursed annually1. The remaining fund balance is about $7.2 billion, inclusive of interest earned. The Fund Financial Statements are presented in Parliament at the end of each FY and are also available online.Based on our current estimates, the Pioneer Generation Fund, with accumulated interest over time, remains adequate to meet the full cost of the Pioneer Generation Package."
review of section 89 of employment act to allow coverage of community hospital stay,"Ms K Thanaletchimi asked the Minister for Manpower whether the hospitalisation of an employee under section 89 of the Employment Act covers his stay at community hospitals and, if not, whether the Ministry will consider reviewing this as more patients may be treated in community hospitals.","Mrs Josephine Teo: Under the Employment Act, an eligible employee is provided with paid sick leave of up to 14 days and paid hospitalisation leave of up to 60 days per year. To qualify for hospitalisation leave, the employee must be certified by a Government doctor or a doctor appointed by the employer to be ill enough to be hospitalised in an acute hospital or national centre. An employee who is so certified shall be entitled to the hospitalisation leave regardless of whether he recuperates in an acute hospital, community hospital or at home.An employee who is not certified to be ill enough to be hospitalised in an acute hospital or national centre but is nevertheless certified to be unfit for work would still be entitled to paid sick leave."
outcome of investigation on causes of collapse of viaduct structure at upper changi road east,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the outcome of the investigation by LTA on the causes of the collapse of the viaduct structure linking PIE and TPE at Upper Changi Road East in July 2017; (b) what are the lessons learned; (c) what are LTA's plans for the completion of the viaduct; and (d) whether there will be any new measures to improve (i) construction of highways and other public works and (ii) workplace safety.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan:  The investigations by MOM, BCA and SPF on the collapse of the viaduct from TPE towards PIE (Tuas) and Upper Changi Road East have been completed. The Attorney-General’s Chambers has filed charges against various parties. Separately, LTA has appointed an independent Professional Engineer to investigate the cause of the collapse. This matter is now before the courts. At this time, it is inappropriate for me to comment on the proceedings. LTA has reached an agreement with Or Kim Peow Contractors (Pte) Ltd (OKP) to mutually terminate the contract to construct the viaduct. LTA will engage a new contractor to demolish any structures deemed unsafe, including all the crossheads, and complete the construction of the viaduct. The project timeline and completion date will be reviewed, after the award of the new contract.LTA will continue to work closely with its contractors to ensure that they comply with workplace safety and health requirements. This includes appointing site supervisors to oversee the daily operations at worksites, and monthly and ad-hoc inspections. LTA also organises regular dialogues and workplace safety trainings with the contractors’ management and staff."
"traffic summons issued to drivers of heavy vehicles along fort road, tanjong rhu road and meyer road","Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) since 2016, how many traffic summons have been issued to drivers of heavy vehicles travelling along Fort Road, Tanjong Rhu Road and Meyer Road; (b) what is the nature of the traffic violations committed by the drivers of such heavy vehicles; and (c) what else can be done to ensure the safety of other road users for that stretch of roads.","Mr K Shanmugam:There has been a high volume of heavy vehicle traffic along Fort Road, Tanjong Rhu Road and Meyer Road. This is due to their proximity to major construction and unloading sites, such as those for the Thomson-East Coast MRT Line and the Marina East Staging Ground. In 2016 and 2017, Traffic Police detected a total of 170 traffic violations committed by heavy vehicle drivers along Fort Road, Tanjong Rhu Road and Meyer Road. Along these roads, the most common violation committed by heavy vehicle drivers was unauthorised U-turns. Aside from deploying more officers to the affected roads and taking enforcement action against errant drivers, Traffic Police has also been engaging construction site operators in the area and fleet-owners whose vehicles ply the roads frequently. This allows Traffic Police to enlist their support and work with them to promote good driving behaviour among their drivers. To manage road safety risks arising from high heavy-vehicle traffic, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) has also developed traffic control plans for the area. As part of these plans, the travelling time and routes of heavy vehicles are carefully managed, such that peak hours and residential areas are avoided where possible. Site operators also conduct regular monitoring, to ensure that heavy vehicles adhere to the control plans. "
marketing scams that target senior citizens,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Trade and Industry in light of reports on sales persons marketing so-called ""freebie"" bags to senior citizens (a) whether the Ministry will investigate these vendors to assess if they are using deception to sell their wares; and (b) whether the Ministry will work with other Government agencies and the Consumers Association of Singapore to look into any loopholes in the law that need a review.","Mr Chan Chun Sing:  We are aware of recent reports of sales persons attracting passersby to their booths by using offers of free gifts and thereafter marketing certain products to them.If consumers have reason to believe that these suppliers have engaged in practices such as pressure-selling or false claims, they can approach the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) with details of these practices for CASE to assist them in seeking redress from the suppliers. The Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act (CPFTA) provides consumers protection against unfair practices such as false claims and pressure selling. Under the CPFTA, CASE can invite suppliers to cease their unfair practices through a Voluntary Compliance Agreement. The Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore, as the administering agency of the CPFTA, is also empowered with investigation and enforcement powers to take action against errant retailers which persist in unfair practices.Consumers are also encouraged to take pre-emptive measures to protect themselves against unfair practices. For example, they can check the reputation of the supplier, ask questions about the products and examine the products before making the purchase. CASE will also continue to educate consumers to be alert to the free gifts sales tactics through its outreach efforts.  "
maternity leave for teachers during school holiday,Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Education whether the Ministry will review the policy on maternity leave for female teachers who give birth during the school holiday period given that they lose out on the number of leave days as the school holiday period is akin to their annual leave.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: Maternity leave granted by MOE is in accordance with the Civil Service guidelines and the Child Development Co-Savings Act. This means the first eight weeks of the maternity leave are paid leave, can commence either during the four weeks immediately before the date of confinement, or immediately after confinement. They are also to be taken in a continuous stretch so that a female employee has time to recuperate and bond with her new born child. The subsequent eight weeks of the maternity leave can be taken flexibly over a 12- month period from the birth of the child, subject to mutual agreement between the female employee and her supervisor.The nature of teachers’ work is unique in the civil service. Teachers in schools are on a fixed cycle of work schedule. They work very hard during the school terms, and can often slow down the pace and take a breather during the school holidays, which is about 12 weeks in a year and longer than leave entitlements for other civil servants. To foster family-friendly workplaces, the Civil Service also provides pro-family options such as part-time employment for officers to look after young children, and leave provisions such as childcare leave, unpaid infant care leave and no-pay leave for childcare. These measures will support parenthood.  "
consider mandatory basic coding skills for primary school curriculum,Ms Tin Pei Ling asked the Minister for Education what are the challenges and implications faced by the Government when assessing whether basic coding skills should be made compulsory in our mainstream primary school curriculum.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: Our primary school curriculum is designed to build strong foundation in literacy, numeracy and the 21st Century Competencies (21CC) that will prepare students well for future learning.Coding skill is however more specific and involves learning particular programming languages which can become outdated quickly. We should instead focus on the underlying and enduring skills such as problem solving, logical reasoning and data-handling.  These foundational skills are currently developed through the learning of subjects, particularly mathematics and science.Instead of making it compulsory, we are working towards exposing a broad group of students to basic coding and technology through enrichment programmes and co-curricular activities. MOE works with IMDA to offer programmes such as 'Code for Fun', 'Lab on Wheels' and the 'Digital Maker' programmes. Since 2014, 93,000 students have embarked on the 'Code for Fun' programme.Students with strong foundation in the underlying skills are able to pick up basic coding readily, and learn programming languages smoothly at later stages of their education, such as in offering Computing as a formal subject at the O- or A-level."
effectiveness of cctv monitoring zones in deterring motorists from parking and alighting passengers in some areas,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Transport (a) how effective have the CCTV Monitoring Zones been in deterring motorists from parking and alighting passengers in places where they are prohibited to do so; and (b) how often are the CCTV footages reviewed for enforcement.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan:  LTA has used closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras since 2014 to deter motorists against illegal parking. This has proven to be effective, reducing the number of illegal parking offences by as much as 90% at some locations.LTA’s CCTV system will automatically detect parking offences from the recorded footage, which will then be further reviewed by LTA’s enforcement team daily.  "
cat ownership in hdb flats,Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether the rule disallowing cat ownership in HDB flats may be abrogated and replaced with rules promoting responsible cat ownership; and (b) whether there are plans to expand the pilot HDB cat ownership programme in Chong Pang to other constituencies.,"Mr Lawrence Wong:  HDB’s pet ownership policies have to strike a balance between residents who are pet lovers and those who are not. A necessary precondition is responsible pet ownership. Most cat-related dis-amenities are due to the irresponsible behaviour of certain owners. Pet owners must ensure that their pets do not adversely affect the living environment in high-rise, high-density Singapore.AVA works closely with HDB, Town Councils and Animal Welfare Groups to encourage responsible behaviour among pet owners. In May this year, AVA appointed the Cat Welfare Society (CWS) as a third-party mediator for cat-related issues nationwide. We hope that this will help bring affected parties together to achieve amicable solutions to cat-related disputes. AVA and HDB will continue to closely monitor the effectiveness of these measures, as well as to engage stakeholders on cat ownership issues.The Member asked about the Project Love Cats pilot in Chong Pang. This is a community-owned project, and requires the sustained support of residents, grassroots leaders, and MPs. Its success is contingent on responsible pet ownership and neighbourly conflict resolution between residents. Among other measures, CWS has been working with the Chong Pang community to sterilise the cats to minimise the risk of dis-amenities, and to microchip them to strengthen owner accountability. These are required for the long-term success of this pilot. We can consider further expansion when the Chong Pang pilot meets these outcomes, and when there is strong community support in other parts of Singapore."
managing growth in demand for foreign domestic workers,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan asked the Minister for Manpower whether the growth in demand for foreign domestic workers (FDW) is sustainable and whether there are measures in place to address the long-term issues associated with a large and growing FDW population.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: Over the last 10 years, the number of foreign domestic workers, or FDWs, in Singapore has increased by about 40%, to 240,000 in 2017. Most of the growth can be attributed to households with elderly caregiving needs, but households with no seniors or young children also hired more FDWs.We are developing more options to support Singaporeans with caregiving needs. This will help to moderate the growth in the number of FDWs and manage the risk of over-dependence, especially if improved job opportunities in the FDWs’ home countries make it less attractive for them to seek domestic work overseas.From 2011 to 2017, the government has more than doubled centre-based day care and home-care capacity for the elderly, and we are on track to meet our targets of 6,200 centre-based and 10,000 home-care places by 2020. Caregivers can also tap community-based care services. For elderly persons without an available caregiver, services such as Meals-on-Wheels ensure that they can have access to regular meals while the Medical Escort and Transport service helps them to attend their medical appointments.Likewise, we are continuing to expand full-day preschool capacity to support the childcare and infant care needs of families with young children. Over the past five years, the government has facilitated the creation of 50,000 full-day preschool places. By 2023, another 40,000 places will be developed, 30% more than today.Families wishing to hire an FDW to meet their general household needs, such as cleaning, may also consider other alternatives. For example, MOM started the Household Services Scheme in September 2017, which lets domestic cleaning service companies have additional foreign worker quotas in order to meet the demand for part-time household services.At the same time, levies for FDWs must be regularly adjusted to reflect income changes and moderate demand. As was announced during the 2018 Budget Statement, from 1 April 2019, the monthly levy for the first and second FDW employed without levy concession will be raised from $265 today to $300 and $450 respectively. In addition, the qualifying age for the levy concession for aged persons will be raised from 65 to 67 years, as more Singaporeans live and remain in good health longer. Households who need help caring for young children, the elderly, or family members with disabilities will, however, continue to enjoy a monthly concessionary FDW levy of $60.Due to our population density, a sharp increase in the FDW population may also result in social friction. Today, we already require all new FDWs to go through a Settling-In Programme. It provides them with tips on adjusting to Singapore’s social and cultural norms, besides educating them on their employment rights, protections and avenues of help. There are also non-governmental organisations, such as the Centre for Domestic Employees, that provide support to FDWs in need."
measures to prevent concrete structures from falling off hdb blocks,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling asked the Minister for National Development (a) what audits have been performed nationwide since the last incident in 2016 of a fallen concrete sunshade; (b) whether there have there been any recommendations or changes made to building design compliance; and (c) what more can be done to prevent future occurrences.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Under the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act, building owners are required to ensure that building exteriors are maintained in a state of good and serviceable repair. For HDB estates, Town Councils conduct regular inspections on building façades as they are responsible for the maintenance of common property. Where necessary, they will engage a Professional Engineer to follow up on any repairs that are required. In addition, HDB conducts annual audit inspections of selected blocks, with a focus on buildings with more facade elements.As highlighted in the Committee of Supply debate earlier this year, BCA will be introducing a Periodic Facade Inspection regime to enable early detection of tell-tale signs of deteriorating facade elements. This will allow building owners to carry out the necessary maintenance and repairs. The regime will focus on buildings above 20 years old, with the exception of private landed houses, temporary buildings and low rise buildings. We intend to introduce legislation by the end of this year.Since 2017, BCA has made available a Facade Access Design Guide to help designers integrate suitable access solutions at the upstream planning and design stage, to facilitate downstream inspection and maintenance of facades. To complement the upcoming facade inspection regime, BCA is working with the industry to develop inspection guidelines for the different types of facades commonly found in Singapore. In addition to training and certifying facade inspectors, BCA is investing in R&D to see how inspections can be carried out in a more effective and productive manner. BCA and HDB have also jointly called for proposals to develop a drone inspection system for building facades."
effectiveness of professional conversion programme in helping participants to switch careers,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan asked the Minister for Manpower whether the career switches that have been achieved by participants of the Professional Conversion Programme to date have met the aims of the programme.,"Mrs Josephine Teo:  The Professional Conversion Programmes (PCPs) help mid-career PMETs reskill and switch careers so that they can move into new occupations or sectors with good prospects for progression. Participants will typically be placed with an employer and earn a salary while training to perform their new jobs. The PCPs have met the aim of helping jobseekers and employers overcome jobs-skills mismatches. Since their launch in 2007, more than 10,000 PMETs have been placed into jobs through PCPs. In recent years, the programme has picked up pace. In 2017, close to 3,800 PMETs were placed through PCPs, up from about 1,300 in 2016. The share of mature and long-term unemployed PMETs placed also rose in 2017, following the increase in training and salary support for these groups of jobseekers. Completion rates for PCPs are above 90%.In addition to PCPs that facilitate skills conversion into different sectors, we now support individuals looking to switch into different occupations within the same sector. We also offer PCPs to re-skill at-risk PMETs for new job roles within the same company and avert possible retrenchments. Last year, we launched Attach-and-Train PCPs to train workers ahead of demand in sectors with long term growth potential. There are currently over 100 PCPs in about 30 sectors, which is approximately twice the number of PCPs a year ago.We will continue to raise awareness of PCPs among jobseekers and employers to support reskilling and career conversion. "
conversion of former school compounds into retirement villages or assisted living facilities,Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry will consider allowing selected former school compounds that are now vacant to be converted into retirement villages or assisted living facilities for the aged without the need to incur capital costs of building such facilities.,"Mr Lawrence Wong:  The Ministry of National Development and the Ministry of Health have been working together on plans to develop retirement housing and assisted living projects to expand the range of housing options for our senior citizens.We are studying the possibility of converting vacant school sites for such developments. Their location within established housing estates will enable residents to age in residential surroundings. Their relatively large site area can accommodate a significant number of housing units and common spaces, allowing residents to interact with one another and develop a sense of community. However, there are also costs involved, to rejuvenate the ageing vacant school properties and re-configure them for housing purposes.We will continue to study different models of retirement housing and assisted living developments to better meet the needs of our senior citizens, and will share more information on our plans when ready."
speed regulators at zebra crossings to slow down users of personal mobility devices,Mr Azmoon Ahmad asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry can consider installing speed regulators at both ends of zebra crossings to ensure that rushing users of personal mobility devices have to decrease their speed when approaching such crossings.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan:  Where possible, LTA installs speed regulating strips on cycling paths when they approach a pedestrian crossing, such as zebra crossings and signalised pedestrian crossings, to remind users of personal mobility devices to slow down when approaching crossings. These are coupled with other signs, including “Watch Out for Vehicles”, “LOOK” boxes with a bicycle logo, and “Give Way to Pedestrians” to guide the behaviour of users of personal mobility devices.It is currently a code of conduct for active mobility device users to stop and look out for on-coming traffic when approaching any pedestrian crossing and to cross only at walking speed. The Active Mobility Advisory Panel is conducting a review of active mobility device user behaviour at road crossings, and will release its recommendations by the end of the year."
root cause of human error that led to nets service outage and preventive measures for future recurrence,"Dr Tan Wu Meng asked the Prime Minister with regard to the interruption to NETS services on 2 February 2018 due to ""inadvertent human error"" during system maintenance (a) whether MAS has identified root causes which predispose the system to human error; and (b) what measures MAS is taking to ensure reliability of cashless transaction providers with significant market share where interruptions can significantly impact businesses and end users.","Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): Following the EFTPOS outage, NETS has conducted their investigations. The investigations have established that the outage happened because while preparing for a planned system change activity, a system administrator inadvertently executed a command that abruptly terminated a communications module which is required for connectivity to the banks. In other words, it is due to a human error.MAS takes very seriously the reliability of our payments infrastructure as it forms a critical part of our financial system and economy.Payment systems that are considered important for financial stability or for public confidence are designated under the Payment Systems (Oversight) Act as Designated Payment Systems (“DPS”). Examples include Singapore Dollar Cheque Clearing, Inter-bank GIRO, Fast And Secure Transfers (“FAST”), and the NETS Electronic Funds Transfer at Point Of Sale (“EFTPOS”).All DPS operators have to adhere to MAS’ requirements on recoverability and reliability. DPS operators have to ensure that the systems are able to resume operations within four hours following any disruption. DPS operators are also restricted to a maximum downtime of no more than four hours across a period of 12 months.In this case, NETS EFTPOS has not breached our regulatory standards. NETS was prompt in notifying the public about the outage, providing updates, and most EFTPOS’ services were recovered in about one-and-a-half hours. NETS EFTPOS has not experienced a similar outage since being designated as a DPS in 2010.Notwithstanding, we need to learn from this episode and ensure that similar incidences will not happen in future. MAS has instructed NETS to appoint an independent consultant to determine how controls could be enhanced to minimise the chances of human errors, and to mitigate the consequences if an error does occur.In the interim, NETS has scheduled all system administrator access to off-peak hours and tightened controls over system administrator IDs. Together, this should prevent a similar incident from happening.MAS will closely monitor NETS’ remediation of the identified gaps and issue supervisory directives to NETS as needed. Separately, recognizing that no payment system is infallible, it is important to ensure that alternative payment methods are in place. During the NETS EFTPOS incident, many affected consumers were able to switch to other electronic payment instruments such as debit or credit cards, as well as stored value facilities such as transport cards and e-wallets."
investigations into cause for escalators catching fire,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is the outcome of SCDF investigations into why escalators catch fire; (b) how can this be prevented; (c) what measures are taken to address the underlying problems; and (d) how many escalators have caught fire in the past five years.,"Mr K Shanmugam: In the past five years, there were four fire incidents involving escalators.In all four cases, the fires were localised and quickly extinguished. In one case, the fire was caused by sparks from welding works. Two other fires had electrical origins, involving electrical components of the escalator. The most recent escalator fire occurred on 5 February 2018 at Ang Mo Kio MRT Station. Investigations into this case are still ongoing.Regular maintenance is important to ensure that all components of the escalator are in good operating condition. Since November 2016, all escalators must undergo monthly maintenance by a registered escalator service contractor. This includes checking all escalator parts for corrosion or wear and tear. The machinery is also inspected to ensure cleanliness and that the safety components are functioning properly. All escalators must undergo annual examination, inspection and testing by a registered escalator contractor, in the presence of an independent Authorised Examiner. Escalator owners and registered escalator service contractors are also required to inform the Commissioner of Buildings of all reportable escalator incidents."
rise in security expenditure and impact on cost of living in singapore,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Finance (a) what has been the average cost of security expenditure per Singaporean compared to other major cities; and (b) whether the rise in security spending will have a direct impact on the cost of living in Singapore.,"Mr Heng Swee Keat: Singapore is a city state and our security spending has to cover both national defence and homeland security. So it would not be appropriate to compare our security expenditure with that of other major cities.We ensure prudent use of our security budget for cost-effective and sustainable solutions. Our security agencies also work together to share intelligence, develop joint operational commands and conduct joint exercises, for optimisation of resources.We do not expect the increase in Government spending in security to have a direct impact on the cost of living for Singaporeans, as security spending is not part of the typical consumer basket of goods and services that households consume. More importantly, the resources allocated to security assure Singaporeans of a safe and secure home to live and raise our families in."
follow-up medical care for released prison inmates,"Dr Tan Wu Meng asked the Minister for Home Affairs with regard to prison inmates who are approaching release and who have multiple medical conditions and follow-up medical appointments, what measures are in place to facilitate the handover and streamlining of medical care to a restructured hospital, family medicine centre or polyclinic near to their homes upon their release.","Mr K Shanmugam: The Singapore Prison Service (SPS) facilitates medical referrals for inmates who require follow-up upon release. For primary care, an inmate would typically be given a referral letter, which he can bring to a polyclinic or family physician of his choice. An inmate who requires specialist or tertiary care follow-up would usually be referred to Changi General Hospital (CGH) for continuity of care, as CGH provides treatment for inmates during incarceration. An inmate may be referred to another restructured hospital should the inmate require treatment under a specialty not available in CGH. The inmate can also request that CGH transfer his care to another hospital."
reinvesting cost savings by public transport operators from going cashless towards improving customer experience,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Transport what measures are being taken by the Ministry to nudge transport operators to reinvest the expected cost savings from going cashless towards improving the public transport customer experience.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: E-payments will bring greater convenience to commuters by eliminating the hassle of doing cash top-ups. It will also allow us to remove cash facilities at MRT stations and buses eventually, freeing up space, manpower and other resources that the Government and the Public Transport Operators (PTO) can dedicate towards enhancing our public transport system and commuter experience. For example, any cost savings from the streamlining of ticketing infrastructure can be channelled towards building of new transport infrastructure. Instead of handling cash transactions, PTO staff can better focus on managing rail operations."
spalling concrete complaints received after defects liability period for home improvement programme,Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for National Development (a) how many cases of spalling concrete happening after the defects liability period has the HDB received for flats that have undergone the Home Improvement Programme (HIP); and (b) whether the HDB will consider additional support or subsidies for flat owners in such cases as flats age and the integrity of structural materials such as ceiling reinforcement bars deteriorate.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Spalling concrete is the flaking of concrete from the ceiling due to the corrosion of steel reinforcement bars in the concrete floor slab. The corrosion is caused by the ingress of moisture and acidic elements, and can lead to cracking and bulging of the concrete cover over time. This is a natural wear and tear process, and is generally a surface maintenance issue which can be mitigated through regular painting of the ceiling. With regular maintenance, spalling concrete is usually minor and can be easily repaired.The repair of spalling concrete is one of the essential improvements carried out under the Home Improvement Programme (HIP), where it is fully funded by the Government. However, this does not preclude the re-occurrence of spalling concrete or occurrence in another area of the flat, as wear and tear will continue over time.This is why there will be cases of spalling concrete even after the completion of HIP or its defects liability period (DLP). Based on experience, after the 1-year DLP, an average of about 13 such cases per 1,000 dwelling units are reported to HDB per year.For all spalling concrete cases after the DLP, flat owners can request for assistance under the Goodwill Repair Assistance (GRA) scheme, where HDB will help to carry out the repairs and co-pay 50 per cent of the repair cost."
forging of singapore passports,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) how widespread is the forging of Singapore passports; (b) how many fake Singapore passports have been detected by foreign governments at their checkpoints; and (c) how many fake foreign passports have been detected by the Singapore Immigration and Checkpoints Authority.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The Singapore passport complies with the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s (ICAO) standards for machine readable travel documents. In fact, the Singapore passport contains security features which are over and above ICAO’s mandated standards.The Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) regularly reviews and upgrades the security features of the Singapore passport. In October 2017, ICA introduced a new design for the Singapore passport with additional security features to make the passport even harder to forge or tamper with.There are few cases of forged Singapore passports. Between 2015 and 2017, ICA investigated and prosecuted six cases of forged Singapore passports.ICA does not have records of the number of forged Singapore passports detected overseas, as foreign authorities do not usually notify others when they detect forged passports.As for forged foreign passports, between 2015 and 2017, an average of about 80 annually are detected by ICA at our checkpoints."
review of fire code for hdb flats,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether the Ministry will (i) conduct a review of the sufficiency of the Fire Code and effectiveness of fire safety measures following the HDB fire in Toa Payoh on 10 January 2018 and (ii) consider including in the Fire Code additional requirements such as the installation of central fire alarm systems and the provision of fire extinguishers at every HDB block.,"Mr K Shanmugam: SCDF's investigation into the fire at the Toa Payoh HDB flat is ongoing. SCDF was alerted to the fire at 9.40 am that day and it was put out by SCDF at about 10.00 am. There were no casualties. Preliminary findings are that the fire was likely of an electrical origin.The fire was contained in the unit where it started and did not spread to other units. This is because under our Fire Code, all residential units are designed as fire compartments, typically using fire-resistant walls and floors, and fire-rated main entrance doors, to mitigate fire spread. The Fire Code also requires residential buildings to have an adequate number of exit staircases. There are also requirements relating to fire engine access and water rising mains, to facilitate fire-fighting operations. The effectiveness of these elements of the Fire Code were seen in this fire.SCDF regularly reviews the Fire Code together with stakeholders from other Government agencies, the industry and academia.In this regard, SCDF will be introducing the eighth edition of the Fire Code later this year. As previously announced, this edition will include a new requirement for all new residential units, and residential units undergoing works which impact fire safety, to install Home Fire Alarm Devices (HFADs). HFADs sound an alarm when smoke is detected. It provides early warning to the occupants of the affected unit, so that they can take immediate steps to evacuate or extinguish the fire. SCDF and HDB will also be providing HFADs for existing rental units under HDB's Public Rental Scheme, at no cost to the tenants.As for fire extinguishers, HDB installs them in community spaces in common areas, in rooms housing utilities services1 and in commercial facilities. The SCDF encourages the installation of fire extinguishers in homes on a voluntary basis, instead of making it mandatory, as they are expensive and difficult to maintain. If necessary, residents can also use the hose reels that are provided in the common areas of HDB blocks to put out incipient fires."
"manpower gaps in quantum computing, big data and artificial intelligence","Ms Sun Xueling asked the Prime Minister (a) what are the manpower gaps in quantum computing, big data and artificial intelligence; (b) whether upskilling of professionals in the local financial sector will be sufficient to provide the talent needed for these fields; and (c) whether there are plans to bring in foreign skilled professionals to complement our local professionals.","Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the prime Minister): Data analytics, machine learning and AI are some of the skills in growing demand in the financial sector. There is also nascent growth in demand for quantum computing skills.As a global financial centre, it is important that financial institutions in Singapore build capacity and competencies in these areas, and they are doing so. More than 20 financial institutions have set up innovation labs or research centres in Singapore, specialising in areas such as data science and machine learning.In building up capacity, shortage of talent remains the key bottleneck. Equipping our local professionals with deep capabilities in these new areas is therefore a priority. To do this, MAS is driving a multi-prong approach.First, to encourage financial institutions to upgrade the skills of their staff in data analytics, MAS launched a $27 million Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics (AIDA) Grant scheme last year. MAS has seen keen interest from the industry since the introduction of the scheme.Second, the Institute of Banking and Finance is offering professionals new learning modules on data science, human-centric design, agile thinking, and cyber security awareness. IMDA, SSG and WSG, under the TechSkills Accelerator initiative are also expanding opportunities for skills upgrading.Third, MAS is working closely with the institutes of higher learning to scale up efforts to build the talent pipeline in emerging technologies. This includes more courses in FinTech specialisation, and also more modular, industry-relevant courses in emerging technologies. For example, MAS partnered local polytechnics in the PolyFinTech 100 initiative, and has equipped more than 1,500 students with skillsets relevant to FinTech.However, growing our own timber takes time. While we build up our local pipeline in these specialist skills, we need to anchor strong international capabilities and talent in Singapore to complement our existing local professionals. But such talent is scarce even internationally, and we must ensure an attractive environment for them in Singapore. MAS is working with the MOM and WSG to pilot the Capability Transfer Programme to bring in expert professionals in these areas, and facilitate the transfer of capabilities to our local professionals.We will continue to take a holistic approach, doing all we can to develop our local pipeline of talent, and tapping on international expertise and talents."
"tampering of water, electrical, gas and e-communication facilities","Mr Chong Kee Hiong asked the Minister for National Development regarding water, electrical, gas and e-communication facilities at residential blocks (a) whether there have been cases of tampering or sabotage of such facilities in the last three years; (b) what measures does the Ministry have to prevent the tampering of meters situated on the outside of houses; (c) whether the security features for these facilities can be enhanced; and (d) when will internal smart meters that send readings to utilities service providers be installed in all residences.","Mr Lawrence Wong: The Government takes any tampering of water, electrical and gas meters, as well as telecommunications facilities very seriously. Such tampering is an offence under the Public Utilities Act, Electricity Act, Gas Act and Telecommunications Act respectively, with offenders liable for fines, imprisonment, or both. This is backed up by regular checks by Town Councils and Singapore Power to detect potential tampering.In addition, meters are designed in ways to make tampering difficult, such as through the installation of physical meter seals, or tightly integrating the meter with the pipes. Telecommunications facilities at residential blocks are secured under lock and key.These measures have been effective. In the last three years, there were about 220 cases of electricity meter tampering at residential premises, which is a small fraction of the 1.5 million utility accounts in Singapore. There were no recorded cases of tampering of gas, water or telecommunications meters/facilities over the same period.As for smart meters, households will have the option to install smart electricity meters if they sign up for retail packages that offer such meters when the Open Electricity Market is launched later this year. Separately, EMA and PUB are exploring various technical solutions to enable the remote reading of meters. One such study is a joint test-bed conducted by EMA, PUB and Singapore Power Group to explore smart metering for water and town gas. The test-bed is currently scheduled to commence later this year."
seeking neighbours cooperation for work on adjoining walls,"Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for National Development beyond verbal persuasion, what are the interventions available to the Ministry and channels accessible to members of public to turn to in instances where owners of landed properties find difficulties to seek cooperation of their neighbours to conduct works involving any adjoining party walls or fence.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Owners of landed properties require their neighbour’s consent if they wish to enter the latter's property to carry out works on party walls or adjoining fences. Owners who face difficulties in seeking their neighbours' cooperation should first engage Neighbourhood Committees or mediation/dispute resolution channels like the Community Mediation Centre, to try to resolve the issues amicably. Alternatively, landed property owners can check with their consultants or contractors to explore methods of work that do not require access to their neighbours’ properties.The Building and Construction Authority (BCA) regulates construction with a focus on the structural safety of buildings. If there is reason to suspect that the structural integrity of any building is compromised, including adjoining walls, BCA officers can enter the premises to carry out inspections. If BCA assesses that there are any structural safety concerns, the Commissioner of Building Control can serve a Dangerous Building Order under the Building Control Act requiring the owner to take immediate precautionary measures to remove the danger and carry out permanent rectification work within a specified timeline. Those who fail to comply with the Order may be subject to a fine of up to $100,000 or imprisonment of up to 12 months or both. Nevertheless, it is preferable for neighbours to try to work things out with each other rather than allowing conditions to deteriorate to such an extent as to pose a danger to both parties."
public education for safe use of personal mobility devices,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Transport (a) what are the current educational programmes on the safe and considerate use of bicycles, electric bicycles and powered mobility devices (PMDs) available in all pre-schools, schools, tertiary, and other educational institutions; (b) whether such programmes are compulsory in all schools and institutions; and (c) whether the Government intends to expand the coverage of such programmes to help create a safe and considerate culture for the use of these devices.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The Land Transport Authority (LTA) and the Singapore Road Safety Council (SRSC) have jointly developed a Safe Riding Programme (SRP), which was rolled out earlier this month. The SRP teaches safe riding practices, proper use of Active Mobility infrastructure, and the rules and code of conduct for riding. The SRP is conducted through classroom lessons and a ‘hands-on’ segment carried out in a training circuit.While the SRP is not compulsory for students, a number of schools, especially those with cycling as an elective module or cycling interest groups, have expressed interest. LTA also disseminates the SRP video to schools to educate students about the key active mobility rules and safe riding practices.Apart from schools, LTA and SRSC are also working with various Government agencies, non-profit organisations as well as interest groups to make the programme available at various community clubs, schools, migrant worker dormitories and shopping malls."
apps and other technology in parent-teacher communications,"Dr Tan Wu Meng asked the Minister for Education (Schools) (a) what proportion of schools currently use smartphone applications (apps) or proprietary online software platforms to communicate with parents of students; and (b) in such schools, what is being done to ensure inclusiveness with regard to parents who may not have smartphones or computer access.","Mr Ng Chee Meng: Our schools constantly seek ways to better communicate with and engage parents to strengthen school-home partnerships. As Singapore's smartphone and internet penetration rate is very high, the large majority of parents have access to technology. Therefore, most schools use some form of smartphone applications or proprietary online software platforms to communicate with parents to increase efficiency and provide parents with greater convenience. Even in such instances, our schools are cognisant that some parents may prefer alternative modes of communication besides technology, or may not have access to computers or smartphones. Hence, schools employ a range of complementary communication channels to ensure they can reach out to all parents, which could include hard-copy letters, students’ handbooks, phone calls, face-to-face briefings and meetings."
penalities for bus captains using the emergency brakes,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether LTA is aware of any company policy among the public bus operators which penalises the bus captain for using the emergency brakes; (b) how many bus captains have been penalised by their employers for using the emergency brakes in the past year; and (c) what is the rationale for such a penalty.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: None of our public bus operators penalises bus captains for using emergency brakes. Bus captains are trained on defensive driving, which includes exercising caution and discretion when applying emergency brakes to avoid accidents and ensure commuter safety.Bus captains who are assessed to brake hard frequently and indiscriminately may be sent for refresher training."
measures taken to manage indiscriminate parking of shared bicycles,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether measures taken to manage the indiscriminate parking arising from the shared bicycle schemes have produced effective results; and (b) under what specific situation will LTA consider stronger regulatory measures to avoid the situation faced by other countries where the shared bicycles have been a public liability in causing disamenities.,Mr Khaw Boon Wan: This Parliamentary Question was addressed in a combined reply on bicycle-sharing on 5 February 2018. My Ministry will be proposing legislative amendments later this month to put in place a licensing framework for bicycle-sharing operators.
compulsory cpr training to all secondary school students,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Education (Schools) whether the Ministry will consider introducing compulsory CPR training to all secondary schools so as to grow the pool of certified first-aiders in the community.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: All Secondary 1 students are taught the knowledge and practical skills of CPR, and the use of the Automated External Defibrillator as part of the Physical Education curriculum. This was introduced since 2017.In addition, in specific Uniformed Groups such as Red Cross Youth, St John Brigade and National Civil Defence Cadet Corps, CPR is a compulsory training component."
designation of lead agency to deal with complex cases of children with special needs,"Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Social and Family Development whether his Ministry will designate a lead agency to manage complex cases of children with special needs from dysfunctional families who present serious behavioural issues impacting on them, their family members and their neighbourhood.","Mr Desmond Lee: Families may find it challenging to cope with behavioural issues in their children with special needs, especially when the parents are not equipped with the knowledge to support them. This is compounded when these families face other stressors, such as financial and marital problems.Supporting these families with complex needs requires multi-agency collaboration, that would include schools, disability agencies and other community partners. Family Service Centres, as key case management agencies in the community, take the lead in ensuring that each agency plays their part to provide timely and holistic support for these families. For complex cases, the SSOs can help marshal these partners to develop a plan of action together and facilitate information sharing, to address the needs of the family and the child effectively.Children with special needs attending early intervention services such as the Early Intervention Programme for Infants and Children (EIPIC), Development Support (DS) Programme and Special Education (SPED) schools, have social workers and psychologists in these programmes who also provide support to caregivers in addition to rendering intervention and educational services to the children. These programmes also have peer support groups to assist caregivers who are facing challenges with their children with special needs. Caregivers can also enhance their care skills through appropriate training that is offered by our disability service providers. These training are made affordable for caregivers with the support of the Caregivers' Training Grant available through the Agency for Integrated Care.In addition to this network of support, caregivers of persons with disabilities can contact SG Enable, who will connect them to relevant services. Caregivers are a key focus under the Third Enabling Masterplan, and the Government is working with social service providers to enhance the ecosystem of support for caregivers in enabling their well-being.Complex and deep-seated issues require changes in parents' mindsets, and managing of their emotions, for them to take ownership and be a partner in the interventions. MSF will continue to study ways of improving social service coordination and delivery across the government, people and private sectors. It will take a concerted effort by all parties involved to intervene, and journey with the families for a period of time to make progress."
reports of workplace abuse and harassment,Ms K Thanaletchimi asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how many reports of workplace abuse and harassment have been respectively reported to the Ministry in the past five years; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider making it mandatory for employers to report all incidents pertaining to workplace abuse and harassment and incorporating this obligation into the Workplace Safety and Health Act.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: In the last five years, the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (or TAFEP) received about 1,500 complaints on workplace issues. Among them six cases were related to allegations of workplace harassment. TAFEP had looked into all the six cases. In four of them, with the employees' consent, we engaged the employer and advised them to take corrective actions. For the two cases where the employees did not wish for TAFEP to engage the employer, we advised the employees on their options. All the six cases were closed after TAFEP had provided advice to the employers or employees.To protect individuals against harassment including workplace harassment, the Government introduced the Protection from Harassment Act in 2014. Employees who face workplace harassment should seek help promptly and can report such incidents to MOM or TAFEP. They can also seek civil remedies directly through the Courts, or report egregious cases to the Police.Employees can also report the matter to their employers if they wish to resolve the matter privately without involving the authorities. Employers are expected to intervene and take necessary actions to address the employees' concerns. Given that there are already multiple avenues for employees who face workplace harassment to seek help, there is no need to legislate mandatory reporting by employers.To create more awareness among employers and employees, SNEF, NTUC and TAFEP conduct regular workshops addressing workplace grievances, including workplace harassment. Employers are also reminded of their obligations to prevent and manage workplace harassment through the Tripartite Advisory on Managing Workplace Harassment. Tripartite partners will monitor the workplace harassment situation closely, and make further interventions if necessary."
assessment of institutions that qualify for tapping on child development account,"Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) how assessment is made to determine which education, healthcare or service provider is included in the list of approved institutions for the use of the Child Development Account (CDA); and (b) whether there are any plans to expand the categories of usage and/or the list of approved institutions.","Mr Desmond Lee: The Child Development Account (CDA) is part of the Government's Baby Bonus scheme, which supports parents by defraying part of the costs of raising children. CDA funds are intended to support the developmental needs of children, such as for pre-school and healthcare. To participate as an MSF-approved Baby Bonus Approved Institution, the education, healthcare or service provider must be licensed or registered by its respective governing body. For example, childcare centres must be licensed by the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) under the Child Care Centres Act; while clinics must be licensed by Ministry of Health (MOH) under the Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act.This helps to ensure that the services and products offered by the AI meet regulatory standards, which include proper administration and quality checks. MSF may revoke the approval granted to any institution if it is no longer in the public interest for it to participate as an AI.The Government regularly reviews the CDA scheme. In July 2012, the approved uses of the CDA were expanded to cover healthcare items at pharmacies, eye-related products and services at optical shops, assistive technology devices and education expenses such as the purchase of uniforms and pre-school registration fees. We welcome more eligible providers to participate as an Approved Institution, to help defray the cost of parenthood, and make Singapore a great place for families."
mitigating waterfall effect due to roof structures on sheltered walkways outside buildings,"Mr Chong Kee Hiong asked the Minister for National Development regarding the roof structures on sheltered walkways outside buildings, whether the Ministry will consider re-designing these structures to mitigate the waterfall effect created on both sides during heavy rain and strong winds.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Sheltered walkways are intended to provide cover against elements such as sun and rain while allowing natural light and ventilation. The design of such walkways takes into consideration both functionality and ease of maintenance.For example, in HDB developments, the design of the sheltered walkways takes into consideration the effective width to height ratio of the walkways, and whether there are sufficient roof overhangs, appropriate roof slopes and proper alignment of the roof eave to drains. Through effective design, users are adequately protected from the weather.To minimise the need for maintenance, HDB's sheltered walkways are designed to be self-cleansing and for rainwater to drain off directly from the roof wherever possible. The design avoids the use of roof gutters which would trap leaves and other debris, thus requiring regular cleaning and maintenance to avoid any blockage and water stagnation that could lead to mosquito breeding.In recent years, sheltered walkways built by HDB and LTA also have roof designs such that they are sloped to one side, so that discharge of water during heavy rain only occurs on the side where pedestrians are less expected to cross. The relevant agencies will take in the Member's feedback and will continue to study how the design of our infrastructure can be improved."
regulation of online platforms that sell drugs that require doctors' prescriptions,"Ms Tin Pei Ling asked the Minister for Health whether local online marketplace or auction platforms are allowed to sell drugs such as antibiotics that require a doctor's prescription and, if disallowed, what the Government is doing to enforce the law.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Prescription-only medicines can only be dispensed from a licensed healthcare institution or retail pharmacy with a valid prescription. Anyone who contravenes this law can be fined up to $50,000 and/or jailed for up to two years under the Health Products Act.The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) works with local web administrators to educate online sellers on the laws regulating prescription drugs and the consequences of illegally selling prescription drugs online. It also works with the web administrators to remove inappropriate online content advertising such sales.In the area of enforcement, HSA monitors online sites to detect illegal sales of medicines, and takes actions against those who engage in such sales. As the issue extends beyond local sites, HSA also works with INTERPOL and its overseas counterparts to tackle the illegal sale of medicines.Finally, HSA has embarked on public education efforts to complement its preventive and enforcement activities. It has issued consumer advisories and press releases to raise public awareness on the dangers of purchasing medicines online. In January 2018 for example, HSA launched an online campaign which included an educational video to highlight the risks of buying from dubious online sources. This video is also being shown by our three public healthcare clusters and three major retail pharmacy chains."
employers covering employees' medication costs for outpatient treatment,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Manpower what is the reason for the Employment Act not mandating that medication costs for outpatient treatment be borne by employers.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: The Employment Act requires employers to provide sick leave to employees after 3 months of service. To apply for sick leave, the employee must obtain a medical certificate by a government doctor or a doctor appointed by the employer. To ensure the employee can do so, we therefore require the employer to pay for the consultation fees.Beyond this, there is no requirement for employers to provide additional mandatory medical benefits for their employees. This is so that job seekers in poorer health or with pre-existing illnesses would not face more hurdles in finding employment. Even so, a MOM survey showed that a vast majority (86%) of employers do offer outpatient benefits on a voluntary basis.Singaporean low-wage workers who face difficulties in meeting their medication costs can access subsidised outpatient care at government polyclinics and specialist outpatient clinics (SOCs) at public hospitals. In addition, lower- and middle-income Singaporeans on the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) can enjoy even higher subsidies at SOCs. They can also use the CHAS card to access subsidised outpatient medical and dental care at private general practitioners and dental clinics."
issuance of government bonds to fund mega infrastructure projects,Ms Sun Xueling asked the Minister for Finance whether the Ministry will consider issuing Government bonds or project level bonds to finance mega infrastructure projects like Changi Airport Terminal 5 and Tuas Mega Port.,"Mr Heng Swee Keat: Bond financing by statutory boards and government companies is one way to finance infrastructure projects. We already do this today. For example, statutory boards like HDB, LTA and PUB have issued bonds to finance public housing, rail and water infrastructure.Such borrowings enable the capital cost to be spread out over a longer period, thus better matching the cost with the benefits over the useful life of the asset. But we also need to consider interest costs, and ensure that there are adequate future revenue streams from the project to service the debt.For the major infrastructure projects that are upcoming, the Government will study the extent to which bond financing can be used, bearing in mind the key principle of ensuring fiscal sustainability."
profile of singaporeans and foreigners who contribute to supplementary retirement scheme,"Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Finance (a) in 2017, how many Singaporeans and foreigners contributed to the Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) respectively; (b) what is the profile and income bracket of those contributing to the SRS; and (c) whether the Ministry has any plans to review the tax-relief provision under the SRS.","Mr Heng Swee Keat: The SRS is a supplementary savings scheme for those who wish to save for retirement, in addition to the CPF scheme. The SRS also provides an avenue for foreigners, who are not allowed to contribute to the CPF, to have a pension plan for retirement.For Year of Assessment (YA) 2017, a total of 75,700 SRS members contributed to their SRS accounts. 72,300 (96%) were locals while the remaining 3,400 (4%) were foreigners. The SRS members came from all income brackets, with a larger proportion from higher-income brackets. This is a natural result as the SRS is intended to encourage supplementary savings beyond what individuals save in CPF.We do not currently have plans to revise the tax relief provided under the SRS scheme."
"cases of investigation, prosecution and conviction under prevention of human trafficking act","Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Home Affairs how many prosecutions, convictions and investigations have been carried out under the Prevention of Human Trafficking Act and under which categories of trafficking are these carried out.","Mr K Shanmugam: Since the Prevention of Human Trafficking Act came into force on 1 March 2015, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and the Singapore Police Force (SPF) have received information on and investigated 166 cases of alleged trafficking. Eight were found to be substantiated.Of the eight cases, five were sex trafficking cases and three were labour trafficking cases. Four of the sex trafficking cases have been concluded with four accused persons convicted. The accused persons were sentenced to imprisonment ranging from 38 to 80 months and fined up to S$30,000.The remaining four cases are still undergoing court proceedings."
cutting inefficiency across ministries,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry asked the Prime Minister (a) what key projects are being carried out to cut inefficiency across Ministries; and (b) whether the Smart Nation office has a timeframe for getting inter-agency work to be reduced in time and effort by using technology.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung (for the Prime Minister): Since the 1980s, the Government has been using automation technology to do our work more efficiently and serve Singaporeans better. Our national libraries use RFID tags to track the borrowing, return and sorting of books, and provide access to a wide range of e-resources on-line; checkpoints at Woodlands and Tuas have automated capabilities to clear motorcyclists and pillion riders; and our hospitals use automated medication dispensing systems.As digital technology advances, more opportunities will arise for our agencies to re-engineer processes, streamline workflows and serve the public better.One important task of many agencies is to respond to public feedback and queries. They can be voluminous. We want to address simple queries quickly, while paying more attention to difficult cases. To help us do this, we have deployed chatbots to handle calls and queries from the public. We are also using Natural Language Processing to spot patterns in feedback and make upstream process changes. For example, the Government Technology Agency ran textual analysis on feedback emails sent by the public to the Housing & Development Board (HDB). This generated the insight that key collection was a major issue. As a result, HDB changed its key collection process from assigning dates to homeowners to allowing them to select a date to collect their keys.Digital technology also enables the integration of government functions across agencies. The OneService App allows citizens to report municipal issues involving multiple agencies on a single portal, without having to access individual agencies’ websites and call centres. But the app is just the front end. It needs to be accompanied by policy and process changes in order for efficiencies to be reaped and services to the citizen improved. We are taking a similar approach to build citizen-centric services around ""Moments of Life"" (MoL), delivering relevant government digital services to individuals based on specific moments in their lives such as the birth of a child. The first phase of the MoL app, centered around parents with young children, will be rolled out by mid-2018. We are also exploring other life moments to cluster services around, and will provide more information on this in due course.The Government is fully committed to using digital technology and continually improving our processes and workflows to serve the public better. This is an ongoing effort."
support for volunteers who are abused on the job,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what the current number of active individuals in the Community Volunteer Programme is; (b) what support is given to them should they be verbally or physically abused by members of the public while carrying out their duties; and (c) whether NEA can equip these volunteers with body cameras to record their interactions with the public.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The National Environment Agency (NEA) launched the Community Volunteer (CV) Programme in 2013 to foster greater ownership of the environment. There are currently about 350 active individuals in the CV Programme.The primary role of CVs is to educate environmental offenders to stop the offending acts and encourage greater ownership of the environment. To enable the CVs to perform their role more effectively, they are empowered to request the particulars of offenders who fail to heed their advice. The particulars are sent to the National Environment Agency (NEA) for follow-up action. Given that the vast majority of the offenders had responded positively to the advice of CVs such as by picking up their litter and no further action was taken against them, there are currently no plans to equip CVs with body-worn cameras. Nevertheless, the CVs are trained to disengage from any abusive offenders.Under the law, our CVs are considered public servants when exercising powers of enforcement. This makes it an offence for anyone to exhibit any indecent, threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour towards a CV in the execution of his duty. It is also an offence for anyone to assault or use criminal force to prevent or deter a CV from discharging his duty. CVs who face verbal or physical abuse in the course of their duty should seek the assistance of the Police and inform NEA of the incident. Depending on the outcome of NEA's investigations, NEA may charge the offender in court for obstruction of duty in addition to the principal offence to send a deterrent message that such behaviour will not be condoned."
implementation costs of workplace safety requirements,Mr Yee Chia Hsing asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Ministry considers the cost of implementing various workplace safety practices when introducing them and whether there is a reasonable cost threshold beyond which the proposed practice is deemed too costly or impracticable.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: The Workplace Safety and Health Act (WSHA) generally adopts a non-prescriptive approach. In most circumstances, we do not spell out specific safety measures, but allow companies the flexibility to adopt suitable methods according to their business needs to ensure safe workplaces.For hazardous sectors and high-risk activities, MOM does stipulate prescriptive WSH measures for the relevant industries. This is to ensure that companies operating in dangerous environments adopt proper WSH measures as any incident can have serious consequences on their workers. In formulating such measures, we do not set cost thresholds, but consult with industry and trade associations, to arrive at measures that are of reasonable cost and practical to implement.We are cognisant of the cost implications to businesses when requiring them to provide a safe and healthy workplace. In this regard, the WSH Council has developed a wide range of WSH programmes and resources to assist companies. While cost of implementing WSH measures is unavoidable, companies need to recognise that any workplace accident can result in greater business losses and immeasurable human suffering to the victims and their families. Hence, WSH measures should be seen as investments rather than costs.Companies have the moral and legal responsibilities to ensure the safety and health of their workers. MOM and WSH Council will continue to work with tripartite partners and industry stakeholders to help our companies improve their workplace safety and health standards in reasonably practicable ways."
adequacy of programmes to guard against problem gambling,Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what the number of Singaporeans who have been subject to Casino Exclusion Orders over the past five years is; (b) whether programmes in place to guard against problem gambling are adequate; and (c) whether the Ministry intends to increase the casino entry levy of $100 for Singaporeans.,"Mr Desmond Lee: There are three types of Casino Exclusion, namely, (a) Voluntary Self-Exclusion, (b) Family Exclusion, and (c) Automatic Exclusion for Singapore residents who are bankrupts, receiving financial assistance from the Government, receiving legal aid, or residing in HDB rental flats with rental arrears. As at 31 December 2017, approximately 24,000 Singapore residents are under Voluntary Self-Exclusion. Some 2,200 had Family Exclusion Orders and 44,000 had Automatic Exclusion Orders imposed on them. These numbers have remained stable over the last five years.We have put in place a robust and comprehensive set of social safeguards to combat problem gambling. This includes casino entry levies, exclusion and visit limits, not permitting credit for Singapore residents who are not premium players, age restrictions, as well as advertising and promotions restrictions. Additionally, there are ongoing public education programmes to raise awareness of gambling disorders.The various social safeguards have helped to minimise the social ills of casino gambling. The latest published Gambling Participation Survey (GPS) in 2014 showed that the overall probable pathological and problem gambling (PPG) rates among Singapore residents was 0.7%. We will continue to monitor the effectiveness of these social safeguards, work closely with our community partners who are helping to tackle gambling addiction, and make changes when necessary."
managing number of heavy vehicle along fort road,Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether there are any plans to manage the large number of heavy vehicles travelling along Fort Road; and (b) what are the measures to improve safety for other road users on this road.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Most of the heavy vehicles plying along Fort Road are going to and from the construction sites for the Thomson East-Coast Line and the Marina East Staging Ground, where excavated materials are transferred to barges for reuse or disposal at offshore sites.The Land Transport Authority (LTA) works closely with the developers and contractors to develop localised traffic control plans to improve safety and minimise inconvenience to other road users. These plans include managing the time and route of the heavy vehicles to avoid peak hour traffic and residential areas where possible. There are signs to alert motorists to slow down and watch out for heavy vehicles. There is regular monitoring to ensure that heavy vehicles adhere to the control plans. In addition, LTA has also installed surveillance cameras at Fort Road to monitor the traffic situation, and deploys enforcement officers when necessary.LTA will continue to engage the residents, grassroots leaders and community advisors in the area to gather feedback and apprise them on the traffic situation."
tailgating detection system at car parks to detect motorcyclists who avoid payment,"Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether the Tailgating Detection System (TDS) will be able to detect motorcycles where the motorcyclists ride on the pavement to avoid paying parking charges; and (b) whether the video recording function of the system can be enhanced to ensure the safety of pedestrians, including strollers and those on wheelchairs, who encounter such motorcyclists.","Mr Lawrence Wong: The Tailgating Detection System's (TDS) primary function is to detect motorcyclists who evade parking charges by tailgating other vehicles. The TDS is also able to detect motorcyclists who bypass the car park gantries by riding on the pavements flanking the Electronic Parking System (EPS) gantries.HDB will take enforcement action against motorcyclists who are detected by the TDS. This serves as a deterrent against such errant behaviour, and in turn enhances the safety of pedestrians. As the TDS was only recently introduced for HDB car parks, HDB will monitor its effectiveness against such motorcyclists."
closing the gap between last step on buses and pedestrian curb,Mr Chong Kee Hiong asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry will consider requiring all buses to be fitted with steps that are lower or can be lowered so that the distance between the last step and the bus stop curb can be closer for the safety of alighting commuters.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: For the safety of commuters, our public buses have low floors with a maximum height of 32 cm above the ground. To ease boarding and alighting, our bus captains are trained to pull up within half a meter of the kerb, and to ensure commuters have boarded or alighted safely before moving off. LTA has been exploring the installation of bus steps which can be lowered but has yet to come across a system that can ensure the safe movement of commuters on and off the bus when passenger flow is heavy."
proposal for more bus stops with cantilever shelters,Mr Chong Kee Hiong asked the Minister for Transport (a) what the current percentage of bus stops with cantilever shelters is; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider constructing more of such bus stops to protect passengers boarding and alighting from the buses during raining periods.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Out of a total of 4,900 bus stops in Singapore, there are currently 74 which have cantilever shelters. It is not cost effective to build all bus stops with such shelters and we have given priority to bus stops which are heavily used, especially those connected to MRT stations. More than a quarter of the bus stops at MRT stations have cantilever shelters. Where space permits, more such shelters will be built for heavily utilised bus-stops."
different fee scale for students with at least one singapore citizen parent,Mr Yee Chia Hsing ? asked the Minister for Education (Schools) whether the Ministry can consider having a different fee scale for non-citizen students whose parents are also non-citizens vis-ل-vis non-citizen students where at least one parent is a Singapore citizen.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: Students in schools pay fees based on their citizenship, with Singapore Citizen (SC) students paying the lowest fee rate, followed by Singapore Permanent Resident (SPR), and International Students (IS) paying the highest fees.For non-citizen students with at least one SC parent who need help with paying their fees, they can approach their schools for assistance and MOE will assess their situation and exercise flexibility on a case-by-case basis."
measures to bridge possible class divide in singapore population,"Mr Seah Kian Peng asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth whether there is a widening class divide amongst the population and, if so, what plans the Ministry has to bridge such gaps.","Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: The Minister for Social and Family Development has addressed at length related questions on income inequality, social mobility and social integration. His written reply pointed out the steps taken by the government in reducing economic disparity and emphasised the importance of social integration, so that we progress together as a people. On this front, we have been doing well. The recent study by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) on Social Capital in Singapore, supported by my ministry, asked respondents to name different kinds of people who make up their social network. The results are encouraging and show a good deal of social mixing. The study found a fair amount of racial and religious diversity in people's social networks. It noted that respondents and their neighbours helped each other with house matters, while workplace ties were an important source of social companionship, inter-ethnic contact, and inter-nationality ties. Although respondents tended to have social networks that were relatively less diverse in terms of educational status and type of housing, the study also found that respondents were able to name people in occupations ranging from low to medium to high status and prestige.1 As this study is the first of its kind in Singapore, it can be built upon to track the trend over time.The IPS study noted that participation in sports, arts and volunteer activities, in addition to schools and workplaces, promotes social interaction and integration across groups. These are areas where MCCY has been working hard at to nurture social cohesion by facilitating shared experiences and strengthening bonds within and across communities. Social harmony is not something we can leave to chance. Over the years, we have introduced initiatives to enhance social mixing on various fronts.One strategy is to create more opportunities for positive interactions among Singaporeans regardless of socio-economic background, age or ability. An example is the Secondary 3 MOE-OBS programme launched in 2017 that has so far brought together 6,000 youths from diverse backgrounds for a 5-day camp where they forge new friendships through challenging experiences. We will progressively expand this programme to include the entire Secondary 3 cohort when the new OBS@Coney campus is ready.Through the arts and sports, our programmes provide opportunities to bridge and integrate communities. Programmes and activities at the ActiveSG Sports Centres, as well as sports initiatives such as Team Nila, SportCares and ActiveSG programmes bring people of different backgrounds and abilities together.Furthermore, SG Cares is forging partnerships across corporates, schools, public agencies, non-profits, community partners and ground-up movements to encourage and support Singaporeans' effort to do good and better help those in need. Through this movement, we are fostering a more caring and cohesive society.Government is doing its part to partner Singaporeans to bridge social divides, but ultimately, a strong cohesive community cannot be commanded by government. Social trust requires the commitment and effort from each and every one of us to build an inclusive and cohesive society."
criticisms of industry transformation roadmaps at pre-budget roundtable,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) whether the Government agrees with the recent criticisms of the Industry Transformation Maps expressed at a pre-Budget roundtable organised by the Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants on 9 January 2018 and how the Government is responding to these criticisms.,"Mr S Iswaran: The development and implementation of Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) is one of the strategies recommended by the Committee on the Future Economy (CFE) to transform our economy and create opportunities for our people. Each ITM is tailored to the needs of specific industries and brings together all relevant stakeholders, coordinated by a lead government agency. As we have emphasised from the outset, the transformation of our industries requires the collective effort of the tripartite partners.In particular, trade associations and chambers (TACs), unions, and businesses are actively involved in the Future Economy Council (FEC) and its sub-committees, with a key role in shaping and communicating the ITMs. For example, the Economic Development Board (EDB) has worked closely with its tripartite partners to develop the Aerospace ITM. This included a forum organised by EDB and the Association of Aerospace Industries (Singapore) in April 2017, for the business community to discuss the Aerospace ITM before its launch last month. Separately, the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) Aerospace & Aviation Cluster consolidated valuable suggestions and feedback from union leaders.The ITMs aim to help all enterprises in their transformation journey, but especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs) who may lack the resources and capacity. This includes helping SMEs to raise productivity, develop talent, harness innovation and pursue internationalization through government schemes, such as SPRING Singapore's Capability Development Grant and the SMEs Go Digital programme. The formation of Enterprise Singapore will give further impetus to this effort.However, it is not possible for the government to reach out directly to each of our over 200,000 enterprises. Hence, TACs and unions must help to propagate the message to their members. Individual workers and business owners must also take the initiative to find out more about the ITMs and how they can benefit from them.Finally, the ITMs are conceived as dynamic plans that respond to the changing economic environment. The FEC regularly monitors the progress of our ITMs, modifying strategies, where necessary, in response to new emerging trends. For example, the Hotels ITM was launched in November 2016, but several new initiatives were introduced just one year later in November 2017 including the Smart Hotel Technology Roadmap to help hotel owners and operators transform their operations through technology adoption.Ultimately, the ITMs are strategic roadmaps that must be owned by all industry stakeholders to sustain the competitiveness of our enterprises and create good jobs for our people in the future economy."
promoting development of retirement villages in singapore,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether the Government has studied different retirement village models; (b) whether any of these are suitable for the ageing cohorts in the next decade; and (c) how land development and zoning regulations can be adjusted to promote the building of retirement villages.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The Ministry of Health and the Ministry of National Development have studied retirement village models, including those in Western countries like Australia and the United States, and in Asia like Hong Kong and Japan.However, we cannot simply transplant these overseas models, and will have to adapt them to Singapore’s context and needs. In particular, during our earlier public consultations for the Action Plan for Successful Ageing, many of our seniors had expressed a strong preference to age in place, in the communities where they live.Hence, the Government has been designing public housing developments that can provide care and support for our seniors within the community. Over the years, we have been placing more eldercare facilities such as Senior Activity and Senior Care Centres in our HDB estates. We have taken this one step further with Kampung Admiralty, where senior residents can access a continuum of social and health services at the Active Ageing Hub to support them as their needs evolve. These include active ageing programmes, assisted living services such as housekeeping and grocery delivery for seniors requiring assistance with their daily activities, and rehabilitation, home medical care and home nursing for seniors who require more care. Residents at Kampung Admiralty also have amenities such as a supermarket, hawker centre and medical centre, all within walking distance.To expand the range of housing options available to seniors, the Government is studying measures to facilitate private housing projects which support the needs of seniors. For example, we are reviewing our Development Control guidelines to provide more clarity on retirement housing developments.We will continue to explore more new models in both public and private housing in consultation with our community partners and the real estate industry. We will share more information on these plans when ready."
number of abandoned dogs following year of dog in chinese lunar calendar,"Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether the Ministry monitors the number of abandoned dogs each year; (b) whether historically, the abandonment rates are higher in the Lunar Year of the Dog and the subsequent year; (c) whether there are plans to work with animal welfare groups to reinforce the message of responsible adoption and pet ownership in view of the upcoming Lunar Year of the Dog; and (d) whether there are plans to work with these groups to deal with any hikes in abandonment numbers to ensure the welfare of the dogs, public health and safety.","Mr Lawrence Wong: AVA started tracking dog abandonment data since 2015 and does not have data from the previous Lunar Year of the Dog in 2006. But we understand from anecdotal feedback that some Animal Welfare Groups or AWGs observed an increased in the number of dogs taken into their shelters shortly after 2006.Hence, the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) is stepping its outreach efforts with AWGs and industry partners to promote responsible adoption and pet ownership. The key message is not to acquire pets on impulse, as keeping them is a lifelong commitment. This year, AVA is working on a social media campaign to promote responsible ownership and to encourage potential dog owners to consider adoption first. AVA will also continue to work with AWGs, schools, and other partners to organise road shows, adoption drives, school talks, and community events to create awareness about animal welfare and responsible pet ownership.Aside from public outreach, AVA has tightened the dog licensing regime as an upstream measure to deter abandonment. As of 1 March 2017, all dogs have to be licensed to the new owner at the point of sale or adoption. This improves traceability and ensures that owners can be held accountable for their pet dogs.Pet abandonment is an offence under the Animals and Birds Act. First-time offenders can be fined up to $10,000 and/or jailed up to 12 months. Last year, AVA successfully prosecuted eight cases of pet abandonment. AVA will continue to monitor the situation closely and carry out enforcement actions where required."
safety and privacy of data on third-party booking apps,Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the LTA has regulatory enforcement powers to ensure that third-party booking apps such as Grab and Uber are required to share timely information such as safety and condition of their vehicles fleet; (b) how personal particulars of commuters and drivers are protected; and (c) what preventive measures are in place to ensure that the safety and data of both commuters and drivers are not compromised.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: We currently do not require private-hire car (PHC) booking service operators and third party taxi booking apps to submit information on the safety and condition of their vehicles fleet. However, under the Road Traffic Act, these operators are required to despatch licensed and properly insured vehicles. If there are three or more violations of these regulations within a rolling period of 12 months, LTA may issue a general suspension order that bars all PHC drivers affiliated with a particular PHC booking service operator from driving for that operator.To protect the data privacy of commuters and drivers, private-hire car booking service operators operating in Singapore must comply with the Personal Data Protection Act, or PDPA. Under the PDPA, organisations are required to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect personal data in their possession or under their control in order to prevent unauthorised access, use or disclosure. Organisations which are found in breach of the PDPA can be liable for a financial penalty of up to $1 million."
impact of promotion of dialects on learning of mandarin,Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for Education (Schools) (a) how has the promotion of dialects helped improve the learning of Mandarin among students so far; and (b) whether the Ministry has done any study to monitor improvements in grades for students taking Mandarin.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: Schools do not promote the use of dialects. Our bilingual policy has enabled a growing proportion of Singaporeans to be proficient in English and their Mother Tongue Language. With our Chinese Language students in schools, our focus is on helping them to learn Mandarin to as high a level as their interests and ability take them. As dialects have differing vocabulary and grammar structure from Mandarin, the learning of dialects may not necessarily ease the learning of Mandarin among students.MOE monitors the performance of students at national examinations closely to assess their level of mastery of the different disciplines. The results of students taking Chinese Language at major examinations have shown a stable trend. Over the past five years, the passing rate of Chinese Language at O-Level has maintained at about 97%, while the distinction rate has held steady at about 40%."
number of hdb flats eligible for home improvement programme but not approved for programme yet,Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for National Development what is the number and percentage of flats that are built up to 1986 and eligible for Home Improvement Programme (HIP) but have not been approved for the programme yet; and (b) what is the timeline set to complete HIP for this batch of flats.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The Home Improvement Programme (HIP) was introduced in 2007 with more than 300,000 eligible flats.HDB has received nominations for the remaining 74,000 HIP-eligible flats, and is working to complete the selection exercise by 1H2018. This constitutes ~23% of the flats eligible for HIP when it was introduced in 2007. In general, a typical HIP project takes about two to three years to complete after announcement. Nonetheless, the time taken differs from project to project due to site-specific issues and conditions."
cutting inefficiency across ministries,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry asked the Prime Minister (a) what key projects are being carried out to cut inefficiency across Ministries; and (b) whether the Smart Nation office has a timeframe for getting inter-agency work to be reduced in time and effort by using technology.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung (for the Prime Minister): Since the 1980s, the Government has been using automation technology to do our work more efficiently and serve Singaporeans better. Our national libraries use RFID tags to track the borrowing, return and sorting of books, and provide access to a wide range of e-resources on-line; checkpoints at Woodlands and Tuas have automated capabilities to clear motorcyclists and pillion riders; and our hospitals use automated medication dispensing systems.As digital technology advances, more opportunities will arise for our agencies to re-engineer processes, streamline workflows and serve the public better.One important task of many agencies is to respond to public feedback and queries. They can be voluminous. We want to address simple queries quickly, while paying more attention to difficult cases. To help us do this, we have deployed chatbots to handle calls and queries from the public. We are also using Natural Language Processing to spot patterns in feedback and make upstream process changes. For example, the Government Technology Agency ran textual analysis on feedback emails sent by the public to the Housing & Development Board (HDB). This generated the insight that key collection was a major issue. As a result, HDB changed its key collection process from assigning dates to homeowners to allowing them to select a date to collect their keys.Digital technology also enables the integration of government functions across agencies. The OneService App allows citizens to report municipal issues involving multiple agencies on a single portal, without having to access individual agencies’ websites and call centres. But the app is just the front end. It needs to be accompanied by policy and process changes in order for efficiencies to be reaped and services to the citizen improved. We are taking a similar approach to build citizen-centric services around ""Moments of Life"" (MoL), delivering relevant government digital services to individuals based on specific moments in their lives such as the birth of a child. The first phase of the MoL app, centered around parents with young children, will be rolled out by mid-2018. We are also exploring other life moments to cluster services around, and will provide more information on this in due course.The Government is fully committed to using digital technology and continually improving our processes and workflows to serve the public better. This is an ongoing effort."
support for volunteers who are abused on the job,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what the current number of active individuals in the Community Volunteer Programme is; (b) what support is given to them should they be verbally or physically abused by members of the public while carrying out their duties; and (c) whether NEA can equip these volunteers with body cameras to record their interactions with the public.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The National Environment Agency (NEA) launched the Community Volunteer (CV) Programme in 2013 to foster greater ownership of the environment. There are currently about 350 active individuals in the CV Programme.The primary role of CVs is to educate environmental offenders to stop the offending acts and encourage greater ownership of the environment. To enable the CVs to perform their role more effectively, they are empowered to request the particulars of offenders who fail to heed their advice. The particulars are sent to the National Environment Agency (NEA) for follow-up action. Given that the vast majority of the offenders had responded positively to the advice of CVs such as by picking up their litter and no further action was taken against them, there are currently no plans to equip CVs with body-worn cameras. Nevertheless, the CVs are trained to disengage from any abusive offenders.Under the law, our CVs are considered public servants when exercising powers of enforcement. This makes it an offence for anyone to exhibit any indecent, threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour towards a CV in the execution of his duty. It is also an offence for anyone to assault or use criminal force to prevent or deter a CV from discharging his duty. CVs who face verbal or physical abuse in the course of their duty should seek the assistance of the Police and inform NEA of the incident. Depending on the outcome of NEA's investigations, NEA may charge the offender in court for obstruction of duty in addition to the principal offence to send a deterrent message that such behaviour will not be condoned."
implementation costs of workplace safety requirements,Mr Yee Chia Hsing asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Ministry considers the cost of implementing various workplace safety practices when introducing them and whether there is a reasonable cost threshold beyond which the proposed practice is deemed too costly or impracticable.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: The Workplace Safety and Health Act (WSHA) generally adopts a non-prescriptive approach. In most circumstances, we do not spell out specific safety measures, but allow companies the flexibility to adopt suitable methods according to their business needs to ensure safe workplaces.For hazardous sectors and high-risk activities, MOM does stipulate prescriptive WSH measures for the relevant industries. This is to ensure that companies operating in dangerous environments adopt proper WSH measures as any incident can have serious consequences on their workers. In formulating such measures, we do not set cost thresholds, but consult with industry and trade associations, to arrive at measures that are of reasonable cost and practical to implement.We are cognisant of the cost implications to businesses when requiring them to provide a safe and healthy workplace. In this regard, the WSH Council has developed a wide range of WSH programmes and resources to assist companies. While cost of implementing WSH measures is unavoidable, companies need to recognise that any workplace accident can result in greater business losses and immeasurable human suffering to the victims and their families. Hence, WSH measures should be seen as investments rather than costs.Companies have the moral and legal responsibilities to ensure the safety and health of their workers. MOM and WSH Council will continue to work with tripartite partners and industry stakeholders to help our companies improve their workplace safety and health standards in reasonably practicable ways."
adequacy of programmes to guard against problem gambling,Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what the number of Singaporeans who have been subject to Casino Exclusion Orders over the past five years is; (b) whether programmes in place to guard against problem gambling are adequate; and (c) whether the Ministry intends to increase the casino entry levy of $100 for Singaporeans.,"Mr Desmond Lee: There are three types of Casino Exclusion, namely, (a) Voluntary Self-Exclusion, (b) Family Exclusion, and (c) Automatic Exclusion for Singapore residents who are bankrupts, receiving financial assistance from the Government, receiving legal aid, or residing in HDB rental flats with rental arrears. As at 31 December 2017, approximately 24,000 Singapore residents are under Voluntary Self-Exclusion. Some 2,200 had Family Exclusion Orders and 44,000 had Automatic Exclusion Orders imposed on them. These numbers have remained stable over the last five years.We have put in place a robust and comprehensive set of social safeguards to combat problem gambling. This includes casino entry levies, exclusion and visit limits, not permitting credit for Singapore residents who are not premium players, age restrictions, as well as advertising and promotions restrictions. Additionally, there are ongoing public education programmes to raise awareness of gambling disorders.The various social safeguards have helped to minimise the social ills of casino gambling. The latest published Gambling Participation Survey (GPS) in 2014 showed that the overall probable pathological and problem gambling (PPG) rates among Singapore residents was 0.7%. We will continue to monitor the effectiveness of these social safeguards, work closely with our community partners who are helping to tackle gambling addiction, and make changes when necessary."
managing number of heavy vehicle along fort road,Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether there are any plans to manage the large number of heavy vehicles travelling along Fort Road; and (b) what are the measures to improve safety for other road users on this road.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Most of the heavy vehicles plying along Fort Road are going to and from the construction sites for the Thomson East-Coast Line and the Marina East Staging Ground, where excavated materials are transferred to barges for reuse or disposal at offshore sites.The Land Transport Authority (LTA) works closely with the developers and contractors to develop localised traffic control plans to improve safety and minimise inconvenience to other road users. These plans include managing the time and route of the heavy vehicles to avoid peak hour traffic and residential areas where possible. There are signs to alert motorists to slow down and watch out for heavy vehicles. There is regular monitoring to ensure that heavy vehicles adhere to the control plans. In addition, LTA has also installed surveillance cameras at Fort Road to monitor the traffic situation, and deploys enforcement officers when necessary.LTA will continue to engage the residents, grassroots leaders and community advisors in the area to gather feedback and apprise them on the traffic situation."
tailgating detection system at car parks to detect motorcyclists who avoid payment,"Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether the Tailgating Detection System (TDS) will be able to detect motorcycles where the motorcyclists ride on the pavement to avoid paying parking charges; and (b) whether the video recording function of the system can be enhanced to ensure the safety of pedestrians, including strollers and those on wheelchairs, who encounter such motorcyclists.","Mr Lawrence Wong: The Tailgating Detection System's (TDS) primary function is to detect motorcyclists who evade parking charges by tailgating other vehicles. The TDS is also able to detect motorcyclists who bypass the car park gantries by riding on the pavements flanking the Electronic Parking System (EPS) gantries.HDB will take enforcement action against motorcyclists who are detected by the TDS. This serves as a deterrent against such errant behaviour, and in turn enhances the safety of pedestrians. As the TDS was only recently introduced for HDB car parks, HDB will monitor its effectiveness against such motorcyclists."
closing the gap between last step on buses and pedestrian curb,Mr Chong Kee Hiong asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry will consider requiring all buses to be fitted with steps that are lower or can be lowered so that the distance between the last step and the bus stop curb can be closer for the safety of alighting commuters.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: For the safety of commuters, our public buses have low floors with a maximum height of 32 cm above the ground. To ease boarding and alighting, our bus captains are trained to pull up within half a meter of the kerb, and to ensure commuters have boarded or alighted safely before moving off. LTA has been exploring the installation of bus steps which can be lowered but has yet to come across a system that can ensure the safe movement of commuters on and off the bus when passenger flow is heavy."
proposal for more bus stops with cantilever shelters,Mr Chong Kee Hiong asked the Minister for Transport (a) what the current percentage of bus stops with cantilever shelters is; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider constructing more of such bus stops to protect passengers boarding and alighting from the buses during raining periods.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Out of a total of 4,900 bus stops in Singapore, there are currently 74 which have cantilever shelters. It is not cost effective to build all bus stops with such shelters and we have given priority to bus stops which are heavily used, especially those connected to MRT stations. More than a quarter of the bus stops at MRT stations have cantilever shelters. Where space permits, more such shelters will be built for heavily utilised bus-stops."
different fee scale for students with at least one singapore citizen parent,Mr Yee Chia Hsing ? asked the Minister for Education (Schools) whether the Ministry can consider having a different fee scale for non-citizen students whose parents are also non-citizens vis-ل-vis non-citizen students where at least one parent is a Singapore citizen.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: Students in schools pay fees based on their citizenship, with Singapore Citizen (SC) students paying the lowest fee rate, followed by Singapore Permanent Resident (SPR), and International Students (IS) paying the highest fees.For non-citizen students with at least one SC parent who need help with paying their fees, they can approach their schools for assistance and MOE will assess their situation and exercise flexibility on a case-by-case basis."
valid claims submitted under work injury compensation act,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the respective number of claims and valid claims submitted under the Work Injury Compensation Act (WICA) since 1 January 2016; (b) whether all successful claimants have received WICA compensation for their injuries; (c) what are the reasons for claimants being unable to receive such compensation from their companies; and (d) what recourse do the claimants have when their companies are unable to pay the compensation sum.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: The number of Work Injury Compensation (WIC) claims has been stable. From 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2017, a total of 33,743 WIC claims were processed, of which 30,695 claims (or 91%) were valid. Another 2,538 claims (7.5%) were withdrawn due to various reasons such as workers wishing to resolve the compensation with their employers privately, choosing to pursue common law or deciding not to proceed with their claims. The remaining 510 claims (or about 1.5%) were found to be invalid after investigation, mostly due to the injuries not being work-related.More than 99.9% of the valid claims were given compensation by employers. Only seven out of the 30,695 valid claims were not compensated by the deadline given by the Assistant Commissioner (Work Injury Compensation). These non-compensation cases arose as the employers failed to insure the workers and they claimed financial difficulties. We take enforcement actions, including prosecution, on these employers for non-insurance and non-compensation, and debar the companies and individual directors from hiring foreign workers until they have provided compensation.Of the seven cases, three have since been compensated. Another one case has been assisted with ex-gratia payments from the Workers' Fund managed by MOM after the employer was sentenced to jail for failing to comply with the Work Injury compensation order. For the remaining three cases, MOM has prosecuted one of the employers, and will take enforcement actions against the remaining two errant employers, such as prosecution or composition fines, depending on the investigation findings. We will provide Workers' Fund assistance to the three affected workers, if the compensation orders are not paid up."
dealing with pest infestation or overgrown tree problems in landed housing estates,Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for National Development (a) what recourse is available to residents living in landed properties when they are affected by problems such as pest infestation or overgrown trees arising from a neighbouring property which has been abandoned or not properly maintained by the owners; (b) what enforcement measures are available to compel owners of landed properties to maintain their property; and (c) in what circumstances can the authorities enter the premises to deal with the issues affecting the other residents.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Residents who face pest and overgrown tree problems from neighbouring properties that have been abandoned or are poorly maintained should first engage Neighbourhood Committees or other community dispute resolution channels to try to resolve the issues amicably. If this is not possible, for example, if the property has been abandoned, and there is reason to suspect public health or safety concerns, NEA and NParks officers can enter such premises to carry out inspections.If NEA assesses that vectors are present or that the premises may harbour or propagate vectors, NEA can serve the occupier with an order under the Control of Vectors and Pesticides Act to carry out preventive measures. If NParks assesses that trees or plants in the premises pose a danger to public safety or property, NParks can issue a maintenance notice under the Parks and Trees Act for the occupier to carry out mitigating measures to abate the danger. Non-compliance with these orders and notices may result in a fine of up to $20,000.If an immediate threat to property, public health, or public safety is observed, NEA and NParks officers may enter the premises to carry out works and measures to reduce or remove the threat. In such a scenario, the occupier would need to compensate agencies for the costs incurred, in addition to any fines which may be imposed."
more resources for pre-schools and childcare centres to manage special needs,"Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar asked the Minister for Social and Family Development with our pre-schools and childcare centres becoming more inclusive of children with special needs, whether additional assistance and support will be deployed to our pre-school and childcare centres so that our pre-school and childcare educators are better able to manage and take care of all the children under their care.","Mr Desmond Lee: Today, some 350 preschools support about 4,000 children with mild developmental needs through the Government-funded Learning Support and Development Support programmes in preschools. Therapists and specially-trained Learning Support Educators (LSEds) provide short-term, targeted developmental interventions for children in these programmes. LSEds also collaborate with the main early childhood educators of the classes in preschools to adapt teaching methods and activities to better engage children with mild development needs in the classroom.Since 2012, MSF and the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) have worked with training institutes and educational providers to roll out specialised training. Early childhood educators undertake the Specialist Diploma in Early Childhood Learning Support to become Learning Support Educators. Educators can also take up subsidised Continuing Professional Development courses to be equipped with the necessary skills to support children with a range of developmental needs.Over the next five years, MSF will expand the development support programme to more preschools and build up a pool of 200 LSEds to provide targeted intervention and learning support for children with developmental needs in preschools. This will support more early childhood educators in the care and education for their children.To better facilitate timely support and intervention, we are also studying how the development support programme can be enhanced to support children with moderate developmental needs within the preschool setting."
criteria for single unwed parents to be allowed to buy or rent flats from hdb,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for National Development (a) what are the criteria that single unwed parents under the age of 35 need to fulfill before their applications or appeals are approved to (i) purchase a flat from HDB (ii) rent a flat from HDB; (b) what are the objective criteria used to determine if such unwed parents are able to continue living with their parents; and (c) what are the criteria used to determine if such unwed parents are able to afford other housing options.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Unmarried parents aged at least 21 and above can apply to buy or rent a flat from HDB with their parents. They are encouraged to live with their parents for mutual care and support to raise the child. Nonetheless, for those without family support, HDB exercises flexibility on a needs-basis to allow them to buy or rent a flat from HDB. They have to meet the eligibility criteria set for singles such as the income ceiling of $6,000 for buying a flat.To assess their housing options, HDB will look at their housing budget based on their income and CPF savings, taking into account estimated living expenses."
application of subsidised flats for divorcees with joint custody of children,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether divorcees with joint custody of their children may apply for subsidised public housing without their ex-spouse's consent; (b) if so, how many of such applications have been approved each year in the last three years; and (c) under what criteria are these applications approved.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Within the first three years of divorce, divorcees with joint custody may apply for a subsidised flat without their ex-spouse's consent, provided they are awarded sole care and control of all the children from the marriage, and all their children are aged below 18 at the time of the divorce.Divorcee parents who do not fulfil the aforementioned conditions and are unable to obtain their ex-spouse's consent may be granted flexibility on a case by case basis. In the last three years, HDB granted more than 200 requests to waive the consent requirement, on grounds such as financial hardship and lack of family support."
joint collaboration to develop vocational training institutions in india,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) what is the progress of the joint collaboration between our ITEs and their counterparts in India in developing vocational training and institutions with the aim of providing vocational education to 50 million students in India.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: The focus of the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) is to provide technical and vocational training to Singaporeans.With growing international awareness of Singapore's reputation in Technical and Vocational Education and Training, or TVET, ITE has been approached by many foreign parties to explore collaborations in their home countries. ITE Education Services, or ITEES, was thus established in 2003 to share ITE's expertise in TVET with overseas institutions. ITEES’ establishment allows ITE to maintain its focus on the provision of TVET in Singapore. ITEES employs its own staff and is self-financing. It offers a range of customised consultancy and training services, which are fully funded by its clients.Currently, ITEES is involved in efforts to help set up vocational skills centres in various Indian states such as Rajasthan and Assam. These centres are part of the Indian government's commitment to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Skill India campaign, which aims to train Indians in different skill sets by 2022.ITEES' role in the development of these centres include advisory on infrastructure development, curriculum development and quality assurance. ITEES also supports in capability building, by training staff in areas such as leadership development, curriculum review and campus design.The various projects are at different stages of development. For example, the Centre of Excellence for Tourism Training (or CETT) in Udaipur was launched in October 2016 and currently offers six courses in the areas of food and beverage, hospitality and retail services. It has over 100 students enrolled to date. ITEES assisted CETT with the development of the course curriculum and trained several CETT staff in leadership and TVET pedagogy.Over in Guwahati, the North East Skills Centre (or NESC) is currently at the planning stage and is expected to be launched by 2019. ITEES has completed training NESC staff in campus design and development, as well as curriculum review and adaptation."
residents who have benefited from enhancement for active seniors programme,"Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for National Development (a) to date, how many residents have benefitted from the Enhancement for Active Seniors (EASE) programme; and (b) how will the Ministry work with the Ministry of Health to enhance the current package of modifications to include fall-risk assessment, sensors and alarms to further help our senior residents.","Mr Lawrence Wong: The Enhancement for Active Seniors (or EASE) programme was launched in July 2012. To date, the programme has benefitted close to 149,000 households.HDB partners hospitals, VWOs and healthcare professionals to study the risk factors leading to falls by the elderly, as well as to develop and review the list of improvement items under EASE. The current list includes (i) ramps for single-step level differences, (ii) grab bars, and (iii) slip-resistant treatment to bathroom floor tiles. The specifications for the items, as well as the locations where they should be installed in the flat, were worked out with healthcare professionals to reduce fall risk for the majority of seniors. In cases where Occupational Therapists make specific recommendations when referring seniors to HDB, we strive to accommodate their needs as much as possible when installing EASE items for them.HDB regularly reviews EASE to ensure it meets the needs of our seniors. This includes engaging healthcare sector stakeholders, such as MOH, to obtain feedback on potential enhancement items. The Member has highlighted sensors and alarms – HDB is currently conducting a trial of the Smart Elderly Monitoring and Alert System (SEMAS) in Yuhua estate, and will study the outcome of the trial before deciding on the next steps."
measures to help families recover defaulted alimony payments,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what is the current percentage of divorced spouses who have defaulted on their alimony payments; (b) how is the Ministry assisting families to recover such payments; and (c) how can we better support families during such times of difficulties.,"Mr Desmond Lee: There were 2,651 maintenance enforcement applications filed at the Family Justice Courts in 2016, down from 2,753 in 2015 and 2,927 in 2014. These comprise enforcements for spousal, ex-spousal, and child maintenance, and we do not have a breakdown for divorces only.The maintenance of spouses, ex-spouses and children is fundamentally a family responsibility. To assist families to obtain the maintenance they need, the Ministry has implemented the Maintenance Record Officer scheme, to identify defaulters who seem to wilfully default on their maintenance obligations. This provides greater clarity for the court, in deciding whether to impose harsher penalties to deter future wilful defaulting.Maintenance default may occur for a multitude of reasons, such as where the defaulter faces financial hardship. To better support families in such circumstances, the Ministry has enhanced the MRO scheme by introducing a new early intervention point to assist complainants when they file an enforcement application at the Family Justice Courts. MROs concurrently assist spouses or ex-spouses in financial need by referring them to Social Service Offices (SSOs) for financial assistance. As of 29 December 2017, 148 complainants with minor children have been assisted through this new intervention point, since the scheme was first implemented on 13 November 2017."
encouraging women to obtain hpv vaccinations to prevent cervical cancer,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Health (a) whether he can provide an update on (i) efforts to encourage women to obtain HPV (human papilloma virus) vaccinations which can prevent cervical and other forms of cancer (ii) the take-up rate for the vaccine; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider more subsidies and awareness-raising efforts to promote the take-up of such vaccinations.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is a cause of cervical cancer. Infection from HPV serotypes 16 and 18, which account for 70% of cervical cancer cases, can be prevented through vaccination.HPV vaccination for females aged nine to 26 years has been recommended under the National Childhood Immunisation Schedule since November 2010. Singaporeans can use their Medisave for HPV vaccination. Based on information from Medisave claims, about one in four Singapore female residents aged 26 years in 2016 have been vaccinated.MOH and HPB have been stepping up on public education efforts, such as making HPV-related information more readily available to the public through the HealthHub website and social media platforms. This has to be done sensitively, as HPV is a sexually-transmitted infection. Parents are also encouraged to discuss HPV vaccination with their family doctors, so that they can make an informed decision to vaccinate their daughters."
tax payment on ns excellence award,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Finance what is the rationale behind the payment of tax by national servicemen on the NS Excellence Award which they obtain for good performance during in-camp training.,"Mr Heng Swee Keat: The NS Excellence Award, or NSEA, is accorded to Operationally Ready National Servicemen who have performed in the top 30% of their cohort in In-Camp Training and courses during their Operationally Ready National Service. As it is an incentive to reward good performance during National Service, the NSEA, like other income from an individual's good performance, is taxable.However, where it is a gift from the Government to show appreciation to NSmen in general and is not a reward for good performance, the gift will not be taxable. An example is the NS50 Recognition Package.To support and in recognition of their service to the nation, NSmen are eligible for a tax relief of between $1,500 and $5,000."
measures to ensure singapore's water supply is free from terrorist attacks and contamination,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources what measures are in place to ensure that the water supply from our reservoirs to the water tanks in each building is free from terrorist attacks and contamination.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: PUB takes the safety and security of our water supply very seriously.PUB has stringent security measures to ensure that the water supply from our water treatment plants to the water tanks in each building is safe. All of PUB's water supply installations, such as the water treatment plants and service reservoirs, are designated as protected installations which are physically secured, with tight access control and surveillance.Treated water from the water treatment plants and service reservoirs is conveyed through a network of buried and pressurised pipelines to customers' premises which prevents attempts to contaminate it. At the customers' end, PUB works with Town Councils, Management Corporation Strata Titles (MCSTs) and building owners to implement measures that ensure the security of their water service installations including water tanks. These include tight measures to secure water tank covers, as well as restricting water tank access to authorised personnel. PUB conducts regular spot checks on all buildings with water tanks to ensure compliance. Our checks showed that the vast majority of our tanks are properly secured. When we detect non-compliance, we take swift enforcement actions against the building management. To signal the seriousness, penalties amount to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or imprisonment of not more than 12 months or both. From 2014 to 2017, there were 22 such cases and errant parties have since rectified the lapses.To complement our security measures, PUB has a comprehensive water sampling and monitoring programme from source to tap. This will ensure that the water supply to customers is safe. Daily water samples are collected from reservoirs, waterworks, distribution systems and customers' taps. The samples are tested at laboratories to ensure no abnormality. Online sensors have been installed at our reservoirs, at each stage of the treatment process and also at strategic locations in the network to keep a close watch on water quality. Over 400,000 tests are conducted annually on physical, organic, inorganic, radiological, bacteriological and microbiological parameters. As an additional layer of checks, PUB submits their water safety and sampling plans to NEA's Drinking Water Unit (DWU) and is required, under the Environmental Public Health (Quality of Piped Drinking Water) Regulations to report any deviations in water quality to NEA's Director-General of Public Health.PUB takes the issue of drinking water quality and safety very seriously and will continue to do their part to keep safe and secure our water supply, I call upon the public to help by being vigilant and to call the police, or provide feedback via the SGSecure app, if they suspect or observe anything suspicious with regard to our water."
effectiveness of workfare training support scheme in encouraging workers to upskill,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how has the Workfare Training Support (WTS) been effective in encouraging workers to upskill; and (b) how does WTS operate in tandem with SkillsFuture Initiatives to improve our workforce's overall skills level.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: Workfare Training Support (WTS) encourages low-wage Singapore Citizens to attend training to upgrade their skills by providing them with substantial course fee subsidies, monetary awards and training allowances. It also supports employers who send their workers for training. Since its inception in July 2010 till December 2017, more than 270,000 unique workers have tapped on WTS to undergo training.WTS is in line with SkillsFuture, a national movement that provides opportunities for Singaporeans to develop their fullest potential through lifelong learning. For instance, Singaporeans receive up to 90% of enhanced subsidy from SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) when they access a curated set of training programmes under the SkillsFuture Series. But with WTS, eligible low-wage Singapore Citizens are supported with an even higher tier of subsidy, at 95% of course fees. Additionally, absentee payroll for employers, as well as training allowance for trainees without employer support are provided. WTS trainees can also receive the WTS Training Commitment Award, which is a cash award of up to $400 per year, for undergoing sustained training.Apart from generous training subsidies, the Government has worked with tripartite partners to put in place other measures to uplift low-wage workers. For example, the Progressive Wage Models in the cleaning, security and landscaping sectors provide clear progression pathways for workers to acquire new skills, take on higher responsibilities and earn higher wages. In addition, the Inclusive Growth Programme provides funding support to companies that undertake productivity improvement projects and share their productivity gains with low-wage workers."
basic computer coding in primary school curriculum,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Education (Schools) whether the Ministry will consider introducing basic coding as a part of the curriculum in our primary schools to create a strong childhood grounding in technology in light of the UK, Belgium, Finland, Netherlands, Estonia and Australia's Queensland state having done so.","Mr Ng Chee Meng: All our students in primary schools build strong foundation in the fundamental skills that will prepare them for future learning, such as literacy, numeracy and 21st Century Competencies. Some of the skills needed for computational thinking, such as problem solving, logical reasoning and data-handling are developed through the learning of subjects like mathematics and science.We expose a broad group of students to basic coding and technology through enrichment programmes and co-curricular activities. We work with the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) to offer programmes such as 'Code for Fun', 'Lab on Wheels' and the 'Digital Maker' programmes. Since 2014, 73,000 students have embarked on the 'Code for Fun' programme.Most of our primary schools also have robotics clubs or info-comm clubs that engage students who are passionate about this area in coding and other computing-related skills, such as developing mobile applications, creating animations, designing computer games and programming robots."
offender's mental condition considered for sentence of reformative training,Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Law whether the Ministry will consider expanding the requirement under section 305(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code that the court must call for and consider the Commissioner of Prisons' report on an offender's mental condition for imposition of a sentence of reformative training to include an independent report from a court-appointed psychiatrist.,"Mr K Shanmugam: At present, the Reformative Training (RT) pre-sentencing report mandated under section 305(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code already includes an assessment of an offender’s mental condition by a Singapore Prison Service (SPS) psychiatrist. The SPS psychiatrist is a professional who is familiar with the design of the RT regime and how it works to achieve the intended outcomes and benefits for the individuals placed under the regime. He or she would make an independent assessment based on professional judgment.If the Court deems it necessary, it can exercise its discretion to direct that the SPS psychiatrist be cross-examined, or that further expert evidence or a second opinion be obtained, including from a court-appointed psychiatrist.It would not be desirable or necessary to impose a general requirement that an independent report from a court-appointed psychiatrist be obtained in all cases, which will apply even to cases where there is no disagreement with the RT pre-sentencing report. Doing so is likely to prolong the offender's remand period for the further opinion to be prepared."
sports hub as default location for national day parades,"Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth why the Sports Hub has not been designated to be the default location for National Day Parades in future.","Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: The National Day Parade has been held in several locations over the years such as the Padang, the Float@Marina Bay and the National Stadium. While the Float@Marina Bay (""Float"") had been intended as a temporary National Day Parade (NDP) venue when the National Stadium was being redeveloped, it has become popular among Singaporeans over the years for its backdrop of the city skyline, and unobstructed views of show segments such as the Red Lions, aerial display and fireworks finale. It was announced last October that the Float will be redeveloped into NS Square, to commemorate National Service and serve as the primary venue for the NDP going forward. That does not preclude the use of the Sports Hub and the Padang as sites for NDP.This arrangement allows the Singapore Sports Hub to focus on developing a year-round calendar of events, such as the International Champions Cup (ICC), while providing flexibility to host the NDP in selected years. This is in line with the vision of our Sports Hub as an integrated sports, entertainment and lifestyle hub for the community and our athletes."
central procurement for common essentials across public hospitals,Ms Sun Xueling asked the Minister for Health (a) whether a study has been done to analyse the benefits of central procurement for common essentials across public hospitals including software for medical documentation; and (b) whether central procurement can be done selectively to lower the cost of setting up and operating hospitals.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: There are benefits and cost savings from the economies of scale achieved through central procurement of common essentials across public healthcare institutions. Since 2001, the public healthcare clusters have been supported by a centralised Group Procurement Office (GPO). Today, the GPO procures about 90% of standard drugs and 60% of non-standard drugs across our public healthcare clusters. It also covers certain common items such as surgical supplies and contract services. More recently, GPO procurement services have been extended to community hospitals and nursing homes.On IT procurement, the Integrated Health Information Systems (IHiS) has centrally coordinated IT system purchases to allow public healthcare institutions to benefit from volume discounts. It has also consolidated the data centres of individual institutions for better efficiencies. These have brought about cost savings for our public healthcare system.We will continue to look for ways to bring about greater efficiencies and cost reductions in the healthcare system through bulk purchase and central procurement, and to pass on the savings to our patients."
increasing income threshold qualification for parent relief claims,"Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Finance whether the dependant's annual income threshold of $4,000 can be increased for tax payers to qualify for Parent Relief claims in order to encourage senior citizens to seek part-time employment.","Mr Heng Swee Keat: To encourage and support the employment of seniors, we have put in place measures, including the Special Employment Credit which is paid to employers of older workers, WorkPro which helps employers redesign jobs and workplaces for older workers, and the Workfare Income Supplement which tops up the cash wages and CPF of older low-wage workers.Tax reliefs such as Parent Relief, Spouse Relief and Qualifying Child Relief are given to taxpayers to recognise their efforts in supporting their family members.These reliefs are intended for circumstances where the dependent is handicapped, or is not earning any income.As some dependants may derive a small amount of incidental income, our approach seeks a balance by setting the dependant’s income threshold at $4,000 a year."
cyber security measures for national electronic health record system,"Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Health with regard to the mandatory National Electronic Health Record (NEHR) system, whether there are standardised nationwide cyber security measures which all healthcare providers have to adopt in order to protect data from being hacked.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Healthcare providers are required to protect their patient records, including electronic records, and to comply with nationwide cyber-security standards, for the purpose of contributing to and accessing NEHR.These include installing a secure IT system, using two-factor authentication and regularly updating the anti-virus security software to enhance the protection against cyber-attacks.MOH will continue to work closely with the Cyber Security Agency and healthcare providers to monitor the cybersecurity threat landscape and put in place additional safeguards when new risks emerge. We will also conduct regular exercises to test the resilience of our systems and maintain a high level of cyber-readiness."
review qualification criteria for grandparent caregiver relief claims,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Finance whether the eligibility criteria for Grandparent Caregiver Relief claims can be revised to allow for such claims when the caregiver (i) draws income below a certain threshold (ii) spends a majority of the time in the caregiver role and (iii) looks after children up to 16 years old.,"Mr Heng Swee Keat: The Grandparent Caregiver Relief is given to working mothers who enlist the help of their parents, grandparents, parents-in-law or grandparents-in-laws to take care of their young Singaporean children aged 12 years old or less.The relief is intended for care-giving for young Singaporean children. We have thus set the age threshold at 12 years old and require the grandparent caregiver not to be working, as the children are young and require adult supervision."
impact of new us guideline of defining high blood pressure,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Health in light of the new US guideline defining high blood pressure as 130/80 mmHg (a) what percentage of our population falls within this category; (b) why is the Ministry not adopting this more stringent guideline; and (c) what is being done to raise awareness of hypertension as the 2010 National Health Survey indicates that one in four persons is not aware that they are hypertensive.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The 2017 American Heart Association (AHA) and American College of Cardiology (ACC) guidelines have defined high blood pressure as 130/80mmHg or higher.However, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has decided to maintain its definition of hypertension as blood pressure 140/90mmHg or higher in its Clinical Guidelines for Hypertension, after consulting local experts. This value remains the general consensus globally, supported by guidelines from societies such as the International Society of Hypertension, the European Society of Cardiology and the National Heart Foundation of Australia. If Singapore adopted the new AHA guidelines, our hypertension prevalence would double from 21.5%% to 43.2%4.Despite the differences in definition, the management approach under the MOH's current and US's newly introduced definition is broadly similar. Under both sets of guidelines, all individuals with hypertension should change their lifestyles, whereas medication is recommended for hypertensive individuals with blood pressure higher than 140/90mmHg. However, specifically for those with cardiovascular risk factors, the US guideline differs from the current general global consensus in recommending initiation of medication at a lower target of 130/80mmHg, after an individual risk assessment. We will continue to monitor developments in this aspect and fine tune our guidelines where necessary.Hypertension can be effectively prevented through healthy lifestyle habits, such as maintaining a balanced diet and avoiding excess salt intake, regular physical activity and not smoking. For those with hypertension, screening and early detection will facilitate prompt treatment to achieve good health outcomes. The Health Promotion Board (HPB) has introduced many initiatives to encourage individuals to live healthily, as well as go for regular health screening under Screen For Life (SFL). The screening subsidies under HPB's Screen For Life were recently enhanced."
plans to further develop social service offices,Mr Teo Ser Luck asked the Minister for Social and Family Development whether there are any plans to further develop the infrastructure and programmes of the Social Service Offices.,"Mr Desmond Lee: Our current network of 24 Social Service Offices (SSOs) was set up between 2013 and 2015 to provide more accessible and coordinated assistance to Singaporeans in need. The locations of these SSOs were chosen such that they are situated close to major transport nodes as well as to residents. Today, 95% of ComCare beneficiaries live or work within two kilometres of a SSO.Infrastructural improvements or relocations are considered and carried out where opportune or needed. For instance, the SSO at Tampines was relocated to Our Tampines Hub, so that its service counters can be co-located with those of other public sector agencies in the Public Service Centre.Apart from providing ComCare assistance, officers in the SSOs also do ground sensing and local services planning, collaborating with community partners to facilitate a coordinated approach to the planning and delivery of social services in the community. These twin purposes remain unchanged, although we are continually looking into ways to enhance service delivery and make it more client-centric.For instance, there are ongoing efforts to tighten inter-agency referral processes and facilitate data-sharing between SSOs and other agencies. We are also exploring the potential for more integrated service delivery by piloting at five of our SSOs1 the delivery of social assistance and employment assistance by the same SSO officer, instead of referring the ComCare beneficiary to a Workforce Singapore (WSG) or e2i officer for employment assistance. For clients who are unemployed but able to work, this provides easier and quicker access to employment assistance. We are also exploring co-locating other complementary services so that our clients can access the services and assistance they require more conveniently and meaningfully. Two of our SSOs2 have VWO-run Family Services Teams co-located with them as part of another ongoing pilot.These efforts aim to bring about better coordination across both government agencies and community partners so as to provide necessary and holistic support for those who have fallen on hard times, and enable them to 'bounce back' and become self-reliant again."
investigation into joo koon mrt train accident,Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether he can give an update on the Ministry's investigation into the Joo Koon MRT train accident; (b) what are the lessons learnt and the steps taken to prevent such incidents; and (c) how serious are the injuries of those injured and whether any person is suffering from a long-term effect of the injuries.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: LTA completed detailed investigations and released a summary of its findings on 18 December 2017. These are consistent with initial findings reported a few days after the collision on 15 November 2017.The root cause of the collision was a software logic issue with the new Communications-Based Train Control, or CBTC, signalling system. It failed to anticipate and hence could not handle a specific confluence of failure conditions. These conditions, in turn, occurred as a result of complications from operating two signalling systems concurrently on a single line – the new CBTC system on the Tuas West Extension and the old legacy signalling system on the rest of the East-West Line.The signalling system supplier, Thales, has rectified the system to address the failure conditions which led to the collision. In addition, Thales will set up a CBTC simulation facility in Singapore to strengthen the CBTC testing process. The facility will enable LTA and SMRT to perform additional simulation tests in a controlled setting which is tailored to our local environment and the infrastructural conditions of our rail network, before deploying it on our train services.As a precautionary measure, we further decided to separate the CBTC operations on the Tuas West Extension from the rest of the East-West Line. The separation will continue until the rest of the East-West Line has fully transitioned to the new CBTC signalling system. Meanwhile, we are speeding up the re-signalling project and the extended engineering hours from MRT early closures and late openings will enable us to complete this transition by the middle of this year.A total of 37 passengers, including four SMRT staff, sustained injuries from the November 15 collision. All were discharged from hospital within a week of the incident, with most discharged on the same day. Nine require outpatient follow-up treatment and SMRT is in touch with them to provide all necessary support. We expect a full recovery."
ensuring strong governance for government funds and grants,Mr Zaqy Mohamad asked the Minister for Finance (a) whether the Government's current policies and governance of funding and grants are robust; and (b) what other measures is the Ministry considering to strengthen governance across schemes that are administered across the whole of Government.,"Mr Heng Swee Keat: Singapore has a sound system of governance that delivers good outcomes at relatively lower spending levels compared to many other countries. We achieve this by ensuring that public monies are used appropriately and properly accounted for.Government agencies commit to Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for all programmes and schemes. These are reviewed regularly to ensure they remain relevant, useful and fulfil their intended outcomes. Value-For-Money reviews are also centrally conducted to assess the cost-effectiveness of key programmes, and often lead to recommendations for further improvements.The rules in the Government Instruction Manuals and Finance Circulars require agencies to have an effective system of internal audit and financial controls. All agencies are required to report their internal control measures and key internal audit findings to their management and the Ministry of Finance.For major expenditures, approval is subject to rigorous evaluation. The Gateway process for development projects, for example, involves reviews by a panel of private and public sector technical experts and approval by the Development Planning Committee at the Ministerial level.Government agencies are subject to independent audits, and the audit scope covers the use of the grants that are disbursed. Agencies also put in place safeguards against abuse, for example, through a system of fraud detection, checks and audits before claims are approved and paid-out.In addition to these controls, there are learning platforms to promote best practices and share emerging trends on governance and internal controls. For example, the Accountant-General's Department recently issued a guide to help agencies in their grant administration. The guide lays out best practices in grant design, evaluation and approval, project monitoring, and grant disbursement.On the whole, we have a sound system in place, managed by committed and competent staff. But improving financial governance is an ongoing and continuous journey. We will continue to be vigilant, and take steps to strengthen our risk management practices and safeguards."
welfare of contract workers hired by public agencies,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Prime Minister (a) what are the deviation or waiver guidelines that allow for rehiring under the Government's contract for Provision of Temporary Contract for Services; (b) how does the Government ensure that these term contract employees' welfare is not compromised when they are hired by the public agencies for 11 months 29 days and rehired after a break of one month; and (c) whether the Government will consider having a separate contract that allows agencies to engage term contract employees for a duration of two or three years.,"Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): Individual public agencies may directly hire workers for short-term work or procure temporary manpower services from employment agencies under a demand aggregation contract.For direct hires, the public agency has an employer-employee relationship with the temporary public officer who is provided with the associated benefits.For temporary manpower services contracted from employment agencies through the demand aggregation contract, the public agency has a client-contractor relationship with the employment agency. The workers are hired by the employment agencies, which are required to provide for the workers' welfare according to prevailing laws, including the Employment Act, Central Provident Fund Act and other relevant laws.Similar to public agencies, the employment agencies are also guided by the Tripartite Advisory on the Employment of Term Contract Employees, which provides workers with continuous benefits if the break in work period is less than a month3. The Public Service Division has been reminding public agencies and contractors to adhere to the Tripartite Advisory and its intent.Given that the demand aggregation contract is designed to fulfil temporary needs, the service periods are generally of less than one year duration. However, the Permanent Secretary or Chief Executive Officer of an agency has flexibility to extend with the employment agency, the services of the temporary worker beyond one year, for good reasons such as when the short-term work needs to slightly exceed one year. The workers will continue to enjoy benefits from their employers throughout their engagement period as agreed in their employment contracts.For work that is more permanent in nature, the Public Service Division advises public agencies to directly recruit individuals as public officers."
returns from government investment in biotechnology industry,Mr Chen Show Mao asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (a) how much has the Government invested in the biotechnology industry over the past 10 years; and (b) what is the return on the Government's investment in the biotechnology industry in terms of benefits to the Singapore economy.,"Mr S Iswaran: Between 2006 and 2015, the Government invested around $7.3 billion in the Biomedical Sciences (BMS) sector in Singapore. This includes funding for BMS-related research and development (R&D), developing infrastructure and human capital, and building up translational and clinical research capabilities. The private sector investment commitment to the biomedical manufacturing industry as well as the business expenditure on research and development (BERD) in the BMS-related fields during this period, totalled around $13.7 billion.Today, the BMS sector is an important pillar of our economy, contributing about $26 billion in manufacturing output or 4% of our Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Singapore is home to more than 50 BMS manufacturing plants, and the sector employs more than 25,000 people.Singapore's sustained investments in BMS have helped to strengthen our BMS eco-system and build up our capabilities in healthcare, drug development and medical devices innovation. This has also enabled our local enterprises to capture opportunities in the rapidly growing global healthcare market, which is projected to reach US$2.7 trillion by 2025. From 2010 to 2016, at least 48 local drug-development and related biotech firms were incorporated, double the number in the preceding decade. One local biotech firm, Tessa Therapeutics, recently came into global prominence when it announced a partnership with the renowned Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy. Tessa is currently conducting the world's first US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Phase III cancer T-cell therapy trial.Notwithstanding these economic outcomes, it should be noted that investments in the BMS sector typically have long gestation periods and require sustained commitment. We will continue to invest in the BMS sector to grow our pool of talent, deepen our capabilities, and strengthen our BMS ecosystem."
enforcement of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws on bitcoin currency,Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Prime Minister what levers are available to MAS and law enforcement agencies to enforce anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws that use bitcoin currency where conventional oversight mechanisms of the real money market do not apply.,"Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): Ms Foo asked how MAS and law enforcement agencies can enforce anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) laws on bitcoin currency transactions. When it comes to money laundering or terrorism financing, Singapore's laws do not make any distinction between transactions effected using fiat currency, virtual currency or other novel ways of transmitting value.Hence, MAS' AML/CFT requirements apply to all activities of financial institutions, whether conducted in fiat or virtual currencies. The Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) is empowered to investigate and prosecute all manner of ML/TF cases. Everyone is required under the law to report suspicious transactions, which they come across in the course of their trade, profession, business or employment, to the Suspicious Transaction Reporting Office in CAD.MAS recognises that virtual currency transactions, given their anonymous nature, may be used to conceal illicit movement of funds. Further, the absence of a central clearing house for such transactions makes enforcement challenging, as it is difficult to identify the parties upon which enforcement orders can be applied.However, at some stage, fiat currency will have to be exchanged for virtual currency, or vice versa, at intermediaries that buy, sell or exchange virtual currency. MAS therefore intends to impose AML/CFT requirements on such intermediaries. MAS is currently conducting public consultation on a proposed Payment Services Bill that will empower us to do this.The virtual currency space is still evolving. Like most innovations, it presents new opportunities as well as risks. MAS is closely watching these developments and studying the approaches taken in other jurisdictions. The basic idea is for our policies and rules to foster innovation while mitigating risks, including from ML/TF."
ban on petrol and diesel-fuelled vehicles,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether the Ministry will consider specifying the future date for banning all petrol and diesel-fuelled vehicles.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Vehicle emissions are a source of air pollution locally. Pollutants in vehicle emissions affect our living environment and can harm our health. Combating vehicular pollution is a high priority for my Ministry and our partners across the Government and industry.We currently have no plans to specify a date to ban petrol and diesel fuelled vehicles. Countries like the United Kingdom and France have adopted this approach, and we are closely monitoring developments. Singapore's vehicular emission policies are technology-neutral and we seek to ensure that our air quality targets can be met in cost-effective ways.Our air quality targets are benchmarked against standards set by the World Health Organisation. We have policy measures to achieve these targets and these include incentives to encourage the purchase of newer and cleaner vehicles, investment in public transport, support for trials of electric and hybrid vehicles, as well as mandatory requirements such as tightened vehicular emission standards. We will continue to strengthen our policies while ensuring the availability of feasible vehicle models to meet our transport needs."
raising students' awareness on improper sexual conduct towards them,Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for Education (Schools) (a) how are schools educating students to report any attempts at improper sexual conduct by any staff member towards them; and (b) whether schools will put up posters to ask students to immediately report to someone in authority if approached to carry out such misconduct.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: Students learn about personal safety and protection from sexual exploitation and abuse in MOE’s Sexuality Education lessons starting from Primary 1 and reinforced throughout their 10 to 12 years of school. They are taught how to recognise sexual abuse and harassment, acquire skills to protect themselves both in real life and online, and understand the laws that protect them in Singapore. They also learn to seek help from trusted adults, such as their parents, teachers and school counsellors when there is risk of their personal safety being compromised."
impact of extended engineering hours on mrt rail maintenance works,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the extended engineering hours provided to SMRT as a result of the early closure and late opening of train services in December 2017 have benefited rail maintenance works; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider such early closure and late opening of train services on a more regular basis in 2018.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Last month, extended engineering hours through early closure and late opening of 19 MRT stations in the western sector of the North-South and East-West Lines were provided to SMRT. The adjustments in operating hours over four weekends, including two full Sunday closures, more than doubled the total number of engineering hours available between Friday nights and Monday mornings in December 2017, from 45 hours to 110 hours.The extended engineering hours have been extremely useful for our engineering and maintenance teams. First, they have enabled LTA, SMRT and signalling system supplier Thales to accelerate the re-signalling of the East-West Line. Each weekend of extended engineering hours has allowed Thales to conduct the equivalent of five regular nights of site acceptance testing. Second, they have allowed SMRT to bring forward and intensify maintenance works and repairs of the running rails, station equipment and track circuits. They have also enabled LTA to conduct more maintenance inspections to ensure the quality of SMRT's maintenance works, especially those by outsourced contractors. Third, they have allowed LTA and SMRT to speed up the installation of noise barriers for the stretch between the Dover and Boon Lay MRT stations. On each weekend, the project team was able to make progress equivalent to four nights of normal engineering hours.For these reasons, LTA and SMRT have announced similar plans for this month, involving the early closure and late opening of 10 East-West Line stations in the eastern sector over four weekends, including two full Sunday closures. Reduced train operating frequencies will also be in effect for seven North-South Line stations in the central area over the same period, as one track will be closed for maintenance.Beyond January, we will extend engineering hours where possible so that we can complete the re-signalling of the East-West Line by the middle of the year. We are bringing forward the renewal of other critical systems on the North-South and East-West Lines, such as the power system and track circuits. We are also making plans to speed up the installation of noise barriers.LTA will work closely with the Public Transport Operators to provide commuters affected by extended engineering hours with timely information and alternative transport arrangements. We are also working closely with the union to ensure that these plans are sustainable for our rail and bus workers. I would like to thank our public transport workers for their dedication, and seek commuters' continued understanding as we redouble efforts to improve train reliability."
international benchmarks to track reliability and safety of mrt system,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Transport (a) what are the assumptions for the 2020 target of 1,000,000 mean kilometres between failures (MKBF) that have been made for our MRT system; (b) what other international benchmarks are available to track the reliability and safety of our MRT system; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider designing new yardsticks to better reflect the actual experiences of commuters","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Two years ago, I challenged the rail operators to significantly improve the reliability of our MRT services and make them among the most reliable in the world. We launched a multi-year effort to bring this about and actively track our performance against the best in class. The Taipei Metro and Hong Kong MTR were picked as our benchmarks, using MKBF (Mean Kilometres Between Failure for delays exceeding five minutes) as the objective measure of train reliability.As Taipei and Hong Kong were able to achieve an MKBF of 800,000 train-km, I set that as our target. Last year, after Taipei achieved an MKBF of 1 million train-km, I updated our 2020 target to 1 million train-km, as I am determined to close the reliability gap with the best in class. It is a stretch target, but with determination and focus, it is within our grasp. We will also speed up our asset renewal programmes and continue to add new lines to enhance the resilience of our rail network.MKBF is an internationally recognised indicator for rail reliability. There are industry groups of large, medium and small metros, such as CoMET (Community of METros) and Nova which publish MKBF data for benchmarking by peers. Based on their data, there are only a handful of metros globally that have achieved an MKBF of 1 million train-km or better.We have focused on train reliability as the key area for improvement. However, commuter experience is shaped by a host of other factors like safety, punctuality, cleanliness and comfort. LTA tracks all these indicators too. In addition, the Public Transport Council monitors commuter experience through its annual Public Transport Customer Satisfaction Survey.We have some way to go before we reach our MKBF target of 1 million train-km. Recent setbacks have affected commuters’ perception of the progress we have made. We are re-doubling our efforts and we seek commuters’ patience and understanding."
better planning for road closures to prevent disruption to essential and safety services,"Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether the police, traffic police or other Government agencies were consulted when Ironman Asia planned the road closures for the Standard Chartered Singapore Marathon 2017; (b) if so, whether these agencies provided adequate advice on how the road closures will affect emergency services; and (c) whether future road closures for similar events can be better managed to prevent disruption to essential and safety services.","Mr K Shanmugam: The Traffic Police (TP) and Land Transport Authority (LTA) evaluate applications for road closures very carefully. Apart from the safety and security of the participants of the event, another key consideration is that emergency services such as hospitals must remain accessible. Also, road users and members of the local community, such as residents and business-owners, should not be overly inconvenienced. If the potential inconvenience and disruption to emergency services cannot be adequately addressed, the application will be rejected.For the Standard Chartered Singapore Marathon 2017 (SCSM 2017), Ironman Asia, the Event Organiser, submitted an application for road closures. TP and LTA evaluated it in consultation with Sport Singapore (SportSG) and SCDF.As part of the evaluation, the initial proposed road closures were significantly reduced in scale, to minimise the impact to the public, and ensure that establishments such as hospitals remained accessible. LTA also conducted a walk-through with Ironman Asia before the event.Raffles Hospital was consulted by Ironman Asia and agreed to the road closure plans. In particular, it was agreed that the portion of North Bridge Road between Rochor Road and Ophir Road would be converted into a two-way road, to allow vehicles to access the hospital via Rochor Road. In the event that emergency vehicles were required to travel within the road closure areas, access would be facilitated by Auxiliary Police outriders, who would escort the emergency vehicles.The road closure permit required Ironman Asia to comply with and execute these approved road closure plans. Arising from public feedback on the traffic management at SCSM 2017, TP, together with LTA and SportSG, are looking into whether Ironman Asia had fulfilled all permit conditions and complied with the road closure plans."
manpower challenges facing auxiliary police forces,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what are the manpower challenges facing the auxilliary police forces; and (b) what are the Ministry's considerations when allowing the deployment of foreign auxilliary police officers at security sensitive locations.,"Mr K Shanmugam: Auxiliary Police Forces (APFs) are important partners to the Home Team. Auxiliary Police Officers (APOs) are deployed for a range of security functions, including protecting sensitive installations and providing security at major events. The APFs are regulated by the Singapore Police Force.The demand for APOs will grow due to the rising threat from terrorism, and major infrastructure projects that require security manpower like Changi Airport Terminal 4 and the new Tuas Port.Our clear preference is to recruit Singaporean APOs to meet this rising demand. The APFs have made significant efforts to do so, for example, providing signing and retention bonuses, and enhancing career progression. This has allowed the APFs to add over 300 Singaporean APOs over the past year. But this is still not enough to meet the projected demand over the next few years. There is a manpower shortage everywhere.Local workforce growth is slowing, and it is difficult for the APFs to find enough Singaporean candidates who meet the requirements. To meet the shortage, we have allowed the APFs to hire Malaysian APOs. But even that pool has been shrinking, and our APFs have been finding it difficult to recruit enough Malaysian officers who meet the requirements. They needed to look for officers from other countries. Thus, the Minister for Home Affairs said in this House in 2017 that we will allow APFs to recruit Taiwanese APOs.In deciding where non-Singaporean APOs can be deployed, MHA considers the operational needs and risks specific to each security-sensitive location. Our requirement was that land checkpoints, for example, be manned only by Singaporean APOs – and that has been said in this House.But operational needs are growing significantly, everywhere, including our checkpoints. Visitor numbers are growing, and at the same time, the threats of terrorism have risen substantially. The security situation has become more complex, requiring more officers. Therefore, we have decided to allow Taiwanese APOs to be deployed at the land checkpoints alongside Singaporean APOs, because there are not enough Singaporean APOs available."
developing affordable home-based care for ageing population,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Health (a) how many residents are currently seeking home-based nursing care; (b) what are the current support for lower income families seeking home-based nursing care; and (c) what are the long-term plans to develop affordable home-care for our ageing population.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Over 4,200 residents are currently receiving Government subsidies for home-based nursing care provided by MOH-subvented providers. This is an increase of 15% from a year ago. Up to two-thirds of Singaporean households can meet the income criteria for receiving these subsidies. Lower income households will receive higher levels of subsidies, which can be up to 80%.In addition, the Government also supports caregivers of seniors in other ways. For example, the Seniors' Mobility and Enabling Fund (SMF) provides funding to offset the cost of assistive devices and home healthcare items. Families who need to hire a Foreign Domestic Worker (FDW) to care for frail seniors may be eligible for a concessionary levy, as well as the FDW Grant, to help offset the cost of hiring a FDW.We aim to expand home-based care service capacity to 10,000 places by 2020. We will also continue to work on the quality and affordability of home and community based care services. For example, we recently introduced ""Integrated Home and Day Care"" services where home-based care is paired with care at day centres. This flexible model enables seniors to interact with others on days when they are well, and cared for at home on other days. We are currently reviewing the Eldershield scheme to help Singaporeans better prepare for the costs of long term care."
reducing occurrences of falling windows,"Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for National Development what plans, beyond public education, does the Ministry have to reduce the occurrences of falling windows.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Public education is only part of a multi-pronged approach Government takes to reduce the occurrence of falling windows. First, there are upstream design and performance requirements for window systems to ensure that structural frames, hinges and other components can safely support the weight of the whole window system.Second, windows can only be installed by approved contractors that are registered with the Building and Construction Authority (BCA). These contractors must have trained installers who have taken a course on window safety and who have at least 12 months of practical experience.Third, home owners also play an important role in ensuring that their windows are properly and regularly maintained. Under the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act, BCA can issue Notices to owners to repair and maintain their windows if they are found to be poorly maintained. If a window falls due to lack of maintenance, the person responsible could be subject to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both.The BCA will take enforcement action against home owners or contractors who contravene the requirements. We will continue to work with home owners to reduce the risk of falling windows."
higher incidence of fires due to charging of batteries for personal mobility devices,"Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Transport in view of the increasing number of fires due to personal mobility devices being charged, whether the Ministry will consider (i) implementing measures to ensure that only approved devices can be imported and (ii) introducing penalties for the import, possession and usage of uncertified devices.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: We are concerned about the recent spate of fires involving personal mobility devices (PMDs). Currently, the power adaptors used to charge PMDs must comply with the Consumer Protection (Safety Requirements) Regulations (CPSR) administered by SPRING. The adaptors must be type-tested and certified compliant with the relevant safety standards, registered with SPRING, and carry the SAFETY Mark before they can be sold in Singapore. LTA and SPRING Singapore are assessing if similar product safety requirements can be imposed on PMDs or their batteries.In the meantime, I urge consumers to exercise caution, such as buying PMDs from reputable sources and avoiding the overcharging of batteries. Consumers should avoid modifying their PMDs or tampering with the electrical components of the PMDs."
rights of individuals assisting in police investigations,"Mr Chen Show Mao asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) under what laws, regulations or other authority are individuals' right to travel restricted when they are assisting in police investigations but not under arrest themselves; and (b) what limits apply to the exercise of any police powers to restrict travel and what recourse is available to appeal against any such exercise.","Mr K Shanmugam: Section 112 of the Criminal Procedure Code empowers Police officers of or above the rank of Sergeant to require a person to surrender his travel document. There are two requirements. Firstly, the Police officer must have reasonable grounds to believe that the person has committed an offence. Secondly, the Police officer must obtain the written consent of an authorised officer. This is a Police officer of or above the rank of Deputy Superintendent, who is specifically authorised by the Commissioner of Police. Section 112 can be used regardless whether the person has been arrested.Section 113 allows a person who has surrendered his travel document to apply to the Police for the return of his travel document. The Police will review such applications. If the application is refused, the person may then apply to a District Judge for the return of his travel document."
successful applications for lease buyback scheme,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development (a) to date, what has been the number of successful applications for the Lease Buyback Scheme since its launch; (b) whether the payouts has been affected by the falling HDB resale prices and rental income; and (c) what has been the average payout for each applicant.","Mr Lawrence Wong: The Lease Buyback Scheme (LBS) was implemented on 1 March 2009. As at 30 November 2017, about 2,500 households have taken up the scheme.The LBS proceeds for each household is dependent on the market value of the flat at the time of application. Specifically, the LBS proceeds are the market value of the flat with its full remaining lease, minus the value of the lease retained by the household and any outstanding monies due to HDB.The average LBS proceeds among the households who have benefited from the scheme to date is about $146,000."
national smartphone navigation app for public transport,"Dr Tan Wu Meng asked the Minister for Transport whether LTA has assessed the feasibility of developing a national smartphone navigation app for public transport that acquires, aggregates and analyses (i) real-time bus and train data from public transport operators (ii) end-user location and velocity data volunteered by app users' smartphones and (iii) user reports of transport delays or breakdowns.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: There are currently a number of such smartphone apps serving commuters’ different needs. LTA's myTransport app provides commuters with essential public transport information based on real-time data, including traffic updates, bus arrival times and crowdedness. Transport operators create their own apps to serve their customers and may also pull in data from public sources to enrich their app content. For example, the SMRT-Connect travel app helps users plan their journeys by providing real-time information such as arrival timings for buses and trains. There are also third party apps such as Google Maps and Citymapper which help users plan their journeys, drawing on many data sources including information volunteered by end-users.We welcome such efforts, as they can individually or collectively serve specific commuter needs. Our job is to facilitate such development by making data open through Data.gov.sg and LTA's DataMall so that private developers can co-create smarter transport solutions with us.In particular, there is potential to collect end-user locations and provide train service disruption notifications as suggested by the Member. As commuter needs evolve, LTA will add more data to DataMall and introduce new features to its mobile app. Transport operators like SMRT have also shared plans to enhance their own app content by providing information on platform and train loading based on analysis of data collected from wifi access points and camera feeds."
impact on business operations caused by suspension of mrt services on tuas west extension,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan asked the Minister for Transport whether the suspension of MRT services on the Tuas West Extension in mid-November 2017 has had a significant negative impact on the operations of firms served by the affected segment of the MRT system.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Following the train collision at Joo Koon MRT station on 15 November 2017, train services on the Tuas West Extension from Tuas Link to Gul Circle stations were suspended from Thursday, 16 November to Sunday, 19 November 2017 to allow LTA, SMRT and Thales to perform safety checks on the signalling system.The suspension of services had disrupted commuters' routine and their employers, but the impact was manageable. During the suspension period, bridging buses were deployed between Joo Koon and Tuas Link stations at headways of three to five minutes. We also enhanced the bus services in the area. Some companies also engaged private buses to ferry their staff to and from Joo Koon or Pioneer MRT stations during the peak periods.I am grateful to commuters and employers for their patience and understanding during the service suspension, and I seek their continued support as the Tuas West Extension remains segregated from the rest of the East-West Line to allow Thales to complete the re-signalling work safely and speedily."
speed reduction and other measures adopted by bus drivers to avoid being penalised for returning earlier-than-scheduled to bus interchanges,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for Transport whether there are any measures in place to prevent bus drivers from reducing their driving speed and deliberately stopping at bus-stops longer than necessary so as to avoid being penalised for arriving back at the interchange too early.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Bus bunching was a common complaint among commuters. In response, we have introduced the Bus Service Reliability Framework to get bus operators to improve the punctuality and reliability of their bus services. It requires bus captains to adjust their speeds to maintain a consistent headway between buses, thus minimising bus bunching. They do not deliberately stop at bus stops longer than necessary. More regular bus intervals will benefit bus commuters as it reduces waiting time and spreads passenger loads more evenly."
impact of impending us tax cuts on singapore's economy,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Finance what is the likely impact on Singapore should the US government reduce their corporate tax rate to 20% and reduce personal income tax.,"23 Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for Finance how will the impending massive corporate tax cuts in the US impact the Singapore economy and its competitiveness as a foreign direct investment destination and whether the corporate tax changes will result in significant US MNCs relocating their operations to onshore US.Mr Heng Swee Keat: As highlighted in the Committee on the Future Economy (CFE) report in 2017, there is increasing competition in the global arena. The current US tax reform includes cut to the headline federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, which is part of the current global downwards trend in corporate tax rates. The top US marginal personal income tax rate is also reduced from 39.6% to 37%.Companies with US linkages are likely to be analysing the details of the US tax reform package and reviewing their options. While the reform may enhance the tax competitiveness of US vis-à-vis other countries, companies would take into account non-tax considerations in their investment decisions. Considerations would include a location's business environment, its proximity to markets, availability of skilled manpower and corporate capabilities.Singapore's corporate tax rate at 17% and top marginal personal income tax rate of 22% are competitive internationally. But we must continue to develop and strengthen our other competitive advantages, by maintaining our pro-business environment and building on our connectivity to the global markets and our strong links to the ASEAN and Asian economies which are expected to continue to grow strongly. We must also continue to deepen the capability of our industries and our people, so that we can continue to stay relevant and attractive to all investors."
capacity of existing crisis shelters,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) how many crisis shelters are there currently; (b) what are their capacities for men and women respectively; and (c) whether the Ministry has plans to expand the number of shelters to accommodate homeless singles.,"Mr Desmond Lee: Individuals who have exhausted all means of accommodation options, are referred to Transitional Shelters which are funded by the Ministry of Social and Family Development and run by Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs). There are three Transitional Shelters with a total capacity of 156 families and 60 individuals catering to both genders. The allocation between men and women will fluctuate from time to time, depending on need. These shelters are intended to provide temporary accommodation, as social workers from the VWOs work with the families and individuals to address their social issues and work towards securing long-term housing arrangements.Individuals who are unable to work, have no financial means and do not have accommodation and family support, are admitted to our Welfare Homes. There are 12 Welfare Homes, with a total capacity of about 2300. There are 1250 places for male destitute persons, 250 places for female destitute persons, and the remaining places are in Welfare Homes that cater to both genders. These homes are funded by MSF and managed by VWOs. They help to meet residents’ basic needs, as well as help them improve their emotional and physical well-being through rehabilitation programmes.For victims of family violence, MSF funds Crisis Shelters to provide them with temporary accommodation, while safety plans are mapped out for these women and their families. There are four crisis shelters with a total capacity of 220 beds.The current capacity of our Shelters and Welfare Homes is sufficient to meet the current needs of individuals and families facing housing issues or crisis. However, MSF is constantly reviewing this as we keep a close watch on intake trends and capacity utilisation of the Shelters and Welfare Homes."
freelancers and self-employed face higher barriers when applying for hdb housing loan,"Mr Ong Teng Koon asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether freelancers and the self-employed face higher barriers when applying for a HDB housing loan compared to salaried workers due to the volatility of their income; and (b) if so, what can the Ministry do to promote the Government's objectives of entrepreneurship and promoting flexibility in the labour market by mitigating the impact of this income volatility.","Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB's credit assessment process is designed to assess the financial ability of prospective flat buyers for prudent and long-term sustainable homeownership. Regardless of the nature of the loan applicants' employment, the maximum loan amount is determined based on the applicants' average monthly income.To ensure a fair assessment of the applicants' income, HDB may require applicants with more variable income to submit documentary proof, or to be credit assessed over a longer period.For those who have difficulty meeting these requirements, HDB will look into their individual circumstances and exercise flexibility where possible, to help them attain homeownership."
government's response to proposed reforms to investor-state arbitration regime,"Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan asked the Minister for Law what is the Ministry's position on the proposed reforms to the investor-state arbitration regime, particularly the creation of a stand-alone appellate body in the current regime or a new international investment court as a multilateral permanent tribunal.","Mr K Shanmugam: The Ministry of Law works closely together with our partners in the legal industry to steer Singapore's overall development and growth as a hub for international dispute resolution, including in the area of investment arbitration. Top international arbitral institutions which handle investment arbitration, such as the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), already have a presence or regularly undertake investment arbitration in Singapore. The Singapore International Arbitration Centre this year also released a set of Investment Arbitration Rules to handle such cases.Investor-State dispute settlement (ISDS) typically involves arbitration of investment-related disputes that arise against the backdrop of international investment agreements or free trade agreements. In these cases, investors may directly bring a foreign State to arbitration, without having to involve their home State as a party to the proceedings. Some concerns have been raised over the present regime for ISDS, such as the independence of arbitrators, the lack of a mechanism to dismiss unfounded claims early, and the absence of a review mechanism to ensure coherence and correctness in arbitral decisions, amongst others. A number of countries, including Singapore, have sought to address some of these concerns in their recent trade and investment treaties, for example, by adopting codes of conduct for arbitrators and building in expedited claims dismissal mechanisms into such agreements.Some quarters of the international legal community have advocated for more structural reform, such as the establishment of an appellate body for appeals against decisions of arbitral tribunals, or a new multilateral investment court as a permanent tribunal. These proposed reforms have more recently been taken up in discussions at various international fora. The details are not yet fully developed. For instance, in July this year, the United Nations Commission of International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) tasked one of its constituent Working Groups to consider concerns regarding ISDS and whether reform was desirable in light of any of the identified concerns. ICSID also recently announced that it will be commencing a review of its rules and regulations to address a number of related issues.Singapore welcomes a discussion of the issues arising out of the current ISDS framework. We take the view that it is important to first carefully consider what the gaps are, and all of the proposed reforms – whether they involve fine-tuning the existing ISDS framework or structural reform – in detail. To this end, the Ministry of Law has been participating in the international dialogue on this issue. We look forward to the development of an ISDS framework that is fair, workable, and cost-effective."
banning practice of declawing cats,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry will consider banning the practice of declawing cats except for medical reasons.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: AVA does not encourage the practice of declawing cats. Such a procedure should only be performed as an absolute last resort or as an alternative to euthanasia. The Code of Ethics for Veterinarians, which was co-developed by AVA and the Singapore Veterinary Association, requires veterinarians to advise their clients about non-surgical alternatives and to ensure that all reasonable efforts have been made to manage scratching problems prior to performing any surgery. Failure to do so can result in written warnings, composition fines, or even suspension or revocation of veterinary licences.That said, there have been occasions where persistent scratching can harm the cat itself, other pets, or humans in the household. For instance, repeated scratches could seriously injure a person who has severe immune-deficiencies or bleeding disorders. In such cases, if the owners are unable to resolve the issue despite having tried all other measures, declawing could well be the only option left for them to keep their cats. The other option would be to give them up. This would be a worse outcome for both the animal and the responsible owner.AVA will continue to educate cat owners and raise awareness on alternatives to declawing. Vets, animal welfare groups and the public can also help to spread the message."
consumer protection given large-scale movement of insurance agents,Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Prime Minister what regulatory safeguards can MAS take to protect the interests of consumers when large-scale movements of insurance agents happen amidst aggressive poaching activities between rival financial institutions.,"Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): MAS takes the issue raised by Ms Foo Mee Har seriously. When an insurer offers attractive financial incentives to attract agents from other insurers, the incentives usually depend on sales targets that these agents have to meet. This poses the risk that the agents may encourage their customers who bought policies from the previous insurer to surrender these policies and buy new ones from the new insurer. This is known in the industry as a ""switch"", and may not always be in the best interests of consumers. For example, they may forgo policy charges or fees they had already paid during the initial years of their existing policies, or be subject to exclusions for health conditions which have developed since they purchased their existing policies.MAS has therefore put in place a few safeguards to protect the interests of consumers. MAS requires the supervisor of the agents to validate that each and every recommended switch is appropriate, taking into account the customer's objectives, financial situation and needs. In the case of vulnerable customers, the supervisor is required to call these customers to check that they understand the policies they have purchased before the policies are issued. In the event that a customer changes his mind about buying a policy, there is a free-look period of 14 days where the sale can be cancelled and the insurer will refund all premiums paid (less medical and other expenses that had already been incurred). As an additional safeguard, MAS requires a party independent of the sales process to perform sample checks on sales transactions.MAS' supervisory activities also cover insurers' compliance with these requirements. MAS will not hesitate to take regulatory action against insurers or agents who are found to have engaged in improper switching.A second concern with insurers offering attractive financial incentives to attract agents is that consumers may in effect bear the cost of such financial incentives. MAS has therefore made it clear to the industry that financial incentives offered by an insurer to recruit agents from another firm cannot be charged to the insurance funds as an expense and must be borne by the insurer’s shareholders. MAS will also check that insurance premiums are not raised to recover costs incurred from such financial incentives, although we expect that competition in the market will reduce the risk of this happening.But this should not be just about the powers that MAS has to supervise the industry. It is in the interests of insurance companies collectively to work together to uphold proper standards. As the industry association which promotes best practices among life insurers in Singapore, the Life Insurance Association of Singapore (LIA) has signalled its commitment to getting its members to adopt responsible recruitment practices to safeguard the interests of consumers. MAS is engaging LIA on the association's proposal to develop guidelines to govern recruitment practices within the industry as well as to address the risks of improper switching following mass movement of agents from one firm to another.Finally, we have been working to educate and empower consumers, so they can make informed financial decisions. Through MoneySENSE, the national financial education programme, MAS works with industry and community partners to help consumers understand the factors they should consider when buying an insurance policy. Consumers should consider their protection needs, how much coverage they require, and whether they can afford the premiums in the long term."
support for children with attention deficit hyperactivity,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the Ministry has any plans to work with the Ministry of Education in identifying and providing more support for children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD); (b) whether diagnostic methods will be deployed with the expansion of early childhood centres; and (c) whether more subsidy schemes will be made available for children who require medication and behavioural or psychological treatments.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: OH has worked with MOE and other agencies to better identify and support children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).For school-going children at or above the age of seven, we have established multidisciplinary teams under IMH Child Guidance Clinic, KKH and NUH comprising psychiatrists and mental health professionals who work with school counsellors and allied educators to assist students with ADHD and other emotional or behavioural difficulties. This programme is called REACH, which stands for Response, Early Intervention and Assessment in Community Mental Health. There are currently four REACH teams serving schools in the North, South, East and West zones. The children may be referred to IMH’s Child Guidance Clinic, NUH’s Department of Psychological Medicine or KKH’s Child and Adolescent Mental Wellness Service for assessment and interventions.As a child's development and function may change with age, healthcare professionals generally avoid making a definitive diagnosis of ADHD at younger ages. Nevertheless, children below the age of seven with suspected developmental conditions, including ADHD, can be identified through touch points such as doctors and preschool teachers. Preschool teachers who identify children with suspected developmental delays may flag them to specially trained Learning Support Educators who will in turn screen the children for referral to assessment and review Termed the Case Filter Meeting, these sessions are chaired by KKH and NUH paediatricians to determine the needs of the child and whether they need to be referred to KKH and NUH's Child Development Programme for further assessments and early intervention through therapies and medical follow-up.There are also other support programmes outside of our hospitals. Those with milder needs may be supported under the Development Support programme offered in some 350 participating pre-schools, where services are provided by specially trained early childhood professionals or therapists. Those with moderate to severe developmental needs can be referred to 21 Early Intervention Programme for Infants and Children (EIPIC) centres run by Voluntary and Welfare Organisations (VWOs).The REACH service and other services which I have mentioned receive heavy Government subsidies to keep the services affordable. Parents who have financial difficulties can approach the relevant agencies for additional assistance."
measures to prevent future flooding in mrt tunnel,"Mr Zaqy Mohamad asked the Minister for Transport (a) what are the findings from the Ministry's investigation of the cause of the MRT tunnel flooding on the North-South Line on 8 October 2017; (b) at the time the disruption announcement was made, whether SMRT was aware that the faults were due to tunnel flooding; (c) what measures have LTA and SMRT taken to ensure that tunnel floodings will be prevented in future; and (d) whether the Ministry will be appointing a Committee of Inquiry to review the incident.","37 Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether there have been regular checks/maintenance on the water pumps in MRT stations to prevent their breakdown/malfunction; (b) if so, what is the frequency of such checks/maintenance; (c) whether there are backup water pumps in the event of breakdowns; (d) what are other measures taken by the MRT operators to prevent flooding due to unforeseen weather conditions; and (e) what is the capacity of the water pump system and the extent to which it prevents flooding.40 Dr Tan Wu Meng asked the Minister for Transport regarding the recent MRT train breakdown due to flooding of a tunnel near Bishan (a) what flood-resistance specifications are included in the tenders for such essential MRT infrastructure; (b) whether fail-safe redundancy at (i) system-level and (ii) component-level is a tender criterion; and (c) whether the future impact of climate change on rainfall is being considered, moving forward.45 Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for Transport what are the ""deep-seated cultural issues"" afflicting SMRT as raised by the SMRT CEO during the press conference that was called in the aftermath of the tunnel flooding incident on 7 October 2017.46 Dr Tan Wu Meng asked the Minister for Transport in light of the MRT tunnel flooding near Bishan, whether LTA will establish a Failure Mode and Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) team to (i) assess the failure resistance of essential transport infrastructure such as the MRT (ii) propose best practices for infrastructure tenders and (iii) search for vulnerabilities which may not fall within a single service provider's purview.Mr Khaw Boon Wan: I thank the Members for their questions. I intend to respond to their questions and those filled by other Members fully by way of a Ministerial Statement on 7 November 2017. I invite the Members to seek clarifications, if any, after the Statement is delivered"
prosecutions involving operation of illegal brothels,"Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) for each year in the past five years, what is the number of prosecutions involving the operation of illegal brothels; (b) what is being done to detect and eradicate such illegal activities in our HDB heartlands; and (c) whether the Ministry is strengthening its response and enhancing punishments for those prosecuted for abetting or committing such offences.","Mr K Shanmugam: Over the past five years, Police have arrested 790 persons for abetting vice activities such as operating illegal brothels. About 12% of these offenders were involved in illegal brothels in HDB flats. An offender convicted of managing a brothel under the Women’s Charter faces a fine of up to $10,000, or up to five years’ imprisonment, or both.In cases where Police have received complaints and detected brothels in HDB flats, Police will also investigate the owner of the flat. If the owner is complicit in the vice activities, he will also face prosecution under the Women’s Charter. If the owner is not complicit, Police may serve a notice on him, which would allow him to be prosecuted if his flat is used for vice activities a second time. The Police will also notify the Housing Development Board, who will take stern action if the flat owner is found to have misused his flat, including imposition of fines, compulsory acquisition and debarment from buying another HDB flat. These actions against the flat owner create a strong deterrence and Police have not seen the same HDB flats being used for vice activities twice. The Police advise HDB flat owners to ensure that their tenants are not using their flats for illegal activities.Brothels in HDB flats typically rely on the internet to advertise their services. The Women’s Charter was amended last year to tackle online vice. A new offence was created to criminalise the operating or maintaining in Singapore of any website or other remote communication service that offers or facilitates the provision of sexual services in return for payment. In May this year, the first person was convicted of this offence. He hosted advertisements for 12 sex workers on a website, and was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment and a fine of $83,000. Police also disrupt online vice by terminating the phone numbers used for the activity and blocking their websites."
public safety given recent wild boar incidents in residential areas,"Mr Seah Kian Peng asked the Minister for National Development in view of the increase in incidents involving wild boars in public residential areas, what are the plans being effected to ensure that the safety of the public is not compromised.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Government agencies have been working closely with stakeholders including ACRES, NUS, Wildlife Reserves Singapore, and nature groups on several fronts.First, we will continue to monitor and manage the wild boar populations in their natural habitats. There are not that many wild boars in our nature reserves. But we have identified a few hotspots where the numbers are higher due to the availability of food. Agencies have been removing oil palms at these hotspots as palm fruit is a favoured food source of the boars.In areas where human feeding occurs, like Pasir Ris-Punggol, enforcement action will be taken. It is important for the public to stop this feeding because this changes the natural behaviour of the boars. Low railings will also be installed in places where these hotspots abut roads to discourage the boars from wandering beyond forested areas.Second, we will manage the movement of wild boars when forested State land is cleared for development. NParks will continue to advise agencies and developers to shepherd wild boars towards other contiguous forested sites and to hoard up areas that are near residential estates and roads. This will reduce the probability of wild boars escaping into public residential areas.In addition, we will step up public education efforts on human-wildlife encounters. AVA and NParks are working on materials to educate residents on what to do when they encounter wild boars or other animals.We will continue to work with stakeholders in residential areas to manage the wild boar issues and ensure public safety."
automatically permitting usage of medisave savings of persons without mental capacity,Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for Health whether the Government will consider automatically permitting the usage of the Medisave savings of a person without mental capacity for his own Medisave-approved medical expenses even though the person is unable to communicate his consent for such usage.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: I thank Ms Lim for her suggestion. As a general principle, a patient's authorisation is required for the use of his Medisave. This is a safeguard to protect the patient. However, the government understands that patients who have lost their mental capacity face many difficult challenges, and we have implemented measures over the years to help these patients and their families, including simplifying the process for authorising Medisave withdrawals.One initiative is to allow a patient to give lifetime authorisation for Medisave withdrawals while he is still mentally well. This arrangement will remain valid even if the patient were to subsequently lose his mental capacity.For a patient who is already mentally incapacitated, a donee acting under a Lasting Power of Attorney or a deputy appointed by the Court under the Mental Capacity Act may authorise the use of the patient's Medisave. If there is no donee or deputy appointed, individuals related to the patient, such as the patient’s family members, can apply to authorise the withdrawal on the patient's behalf.We will study Ms Lim's suggestion together with feedback from other stakeholders as part of our continuous review on ways to assist patients who have lost their mental capacity, while providing the necessary safeguards to protect patients' interests and well-being."
solutions for estates with private properties with less than 20 years in remaining lease,"Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling asked the Minister for National Development (a) for elderly Singaporeans living in private property with a remaining lease of about 20 years, whether the Ministry will consider offering them transition or interim housing during the debarment period for the purchase of a HDB flat; and (b) what measures are taken to ensure that the neighbourhood of such properties will not be disproportionately populated by short-term rentals or become quarters for foreign workers predominantly.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Singaporeans living in properties with short remaining leases are encouraged to plan ahead for their lease expiry, and source for alternative housing early. Senior Citizens have various housing options, including short-lease two-Room Flexi flats, for which there is no debarment period for purchase. Residents can approach agencies for assistance if they need help transitioning to their next housing arrangement.To safeguard the residential environment of private housing estates and minimise disturbance to neighbours, owners of private residential premises are only allowed to rent out their properties with a minimum tenancy period of three months. Each unit should also only have a maximum of six unrelated occupants. URA will proactively enforce against subletting arrangements that flout the rules, including prosecuting egregious offenders in court."
exceeding medisave claimable limit under medisave maternity package,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the number and percentage of women who have exceeded their Medisave claimable limit under the Medisave Maternity Package in the last two years; (b) what are the reasons why the hospitalisation cost exceeds the Medisave claimable limit; and (c) whether greater flexibility can be given to the CPF account holder paying for the hospitalisation cost to utilise the Medisave beyond the claimable limit for operations arising from complications during delivery.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Medisave Maternity Package is sized to be adequate for subsidized care. Patients can claim up to $900 for pre-delivery bills, and up to $450 per day for hospitalization, while claim limits for delivery procedure ranges from $750 for a normal vaginal delivery to $2150 for a more complicated delivery such as caesarian birth.Over the last two years, the package fully covered three in four subsidized deliveries, resulting in zero out-of-pocket payment by the patients. 8 in 10 subsidized deliveries had an out-of-pocket payment of $500 or less.Patients who face financial difficulties may approach medical social workers at our public healthcare institutions for assistance and we will consider each appeal on a case-by-case basis."
strategies to ensure retirement adequacy as more hdb flats approach end of 99-year leases,"Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for National Development as HDB flats approach the end of their 99-year leases, what strategies are available to Singaporeans who wish to monetise their 'nest egg' in order to supplement their retirement needs.","Mr Lawrence Wong: There are various monetisation options for elderly flat owners to unlock the value of their flats to supplement their retirement needs. They can sell their flats in the resale market, right-size to a smaller flat, and apply for the Silver Housing Bonus. Alternatively, if they wish to retain their flat, they can sublet a spare bedroom or their whole flat, or apply for the Lease Buyback Scheme. HDB flats will continue to be a good store of value if flat buyers plan ahead and make prudent housing choices."
helping families out of poverty cycle,Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what measurements and processes are used to distinguish between people experiencing episodic poverty and those experiencing chronic poverty; (b) what is the average number of months that a Singaporean stays in an episode of poverty before moving out of it; (c) what is the percentage of our population that stays in poverty for more than one year; and (d) how does the Ministry work with other stakeholders to leverage on the strengths of low-income families who cycle in and out of episodic poverty to ensure they do not wind up in chronic poverty.,"Mr Desmond Lee: The Government invests heavily in education, healthcare, housing and skills upgrading for Singaporeans, so that all have opportunities to do well in life. These range from broad-based subsidies and incentives that benefit many, to targeted assistance for lower income or vulnerable groups who need additional help.As the needs of the low-income or vulnerable groups are often multi-faceted, concepts like chronic or episodic poverty, which rely on a poverty measure based on one dimension, such as income threshold or housing type, are inadequate. Rather, we have in place multiple layers of government assistance and a network of government and community agencies that provide targeted and customised assistance for individuals or households in need.A sustainable social safety net is built on the values of individual self-reliance, family support and a caring community. Families form the foundation of our society and should be the first line of support. The wider community also plays a part in the outreach and care for the less fortunate. While the Government will do more, we need to draw on the strengths of our stakeholders to enhance the stability and resilience of vulnerable groups.In some instances, these forms of assistance function as a safety net – to keep people from falling further, and to sustain them for the long haul. ComCare Long-Term Assistance is one example of this, where a person who is unable to work due to age or health reasons and does not have any financial means or family support need to be assisted with basic needs for the long term.In other instances, assistance schemes try to help people in difficulty bounce back up – through significant, targeted support for education, employment, skills upgrading and housing, among others. For example, we have introduced upstream programmes such as KidSTART and the Fresh Start Housing Scheme, to support low-income families in their aspirations to provide a good foundation for their children and to own a home again. Our Social Service Offices work with community partners such as Family Service Centres and Voluntary Welfare Organisations to identify the needs of vulnerable groups, as well as their strengths and resources to help themselves, which upholds their dignity and enhances their resilience. The community plays a key role in helping low-income families avoid entrenchment. For example, Mendaki's Family Excellence Circles brings together low-income parents to interact, exchange ideas and share best practices to cope with daily challenges and embrace lifelong learning."
enforcement actions against illegal hawkers outside lucky plaza,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources with regard to the increasing illegal hawking cases outside Lucky Plaza (a) what are the enforcement actions taken against the illegal hawkers; and (b) what plans does the Ministry have to stop such illegal hawking along Orchard Road.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The National Environment Agency (NEA) takes action against illegal hawkers, particularly if there is sale of food, as it poses a risk to public health and causes public disamenities. Under the Environmental Public Health Act, those caught hawking illegally can be fined up to $5,000 for the first offence, and $10,000 for subsequent offences. Their goods may also be seized and disposed of.Since January 2017, we have received 15 instances of feedback concerning illegal hawking activities at Lucky Plaza. The NEA has carried out several checks and taken enforcement actions against nine offenders for illegal hawking activities.My Ministry will continue to monitor the situation at Orchard Road closely. We will not hesitate to take enforcement action against anyone found hawking illegally. However, to better tackle the problem, we need the co-operation of members of the public not to patronise illegal hawkers and to report any illegal hawking activity through NEA's 24-hour call centre."
number of arrests for physical assaults in public areas,"Ms Tin Pei Ling asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) how many people have been arrested for physical assaults in public areas on an annual basis over the past 10 years; (b) of this number, how many involve foreigners; (c) what will the Government do to deter such behaviours; and (d) whether penalties for foreign assailants can be enhanced.","Mr K Shanmugam: Between 2007 and 2016, an average of about 1,700 persons were arrested annually for physical assault in public areas. About one-fifth were foreigners.Our tough laws and effective enforcement serve as important deterrence. For instance, where the physical assault had caused grievous hurt, the offender is liable to be imprisoned for up to 10 years, and also to be fined or caned. These laws and punishments must apply equally to both locals and foreigners.The Police conduct regular patrols and licensing checks in areas that tend to see more incidents of physical assault, such as public entertainment outlets. The Police also work with the operators of such outlets on measures to minimize occurrences, including installing more CCTVs and improving the lighting."
accidents at junctions where pedestrians and turning vehicles share green time,"Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for Transport (a) for the past 10 years, what is the number of accidents involving pedestrians or multiple vehicles at junctions where pedestrians and turning vehicles share the same green time versus junctions where they do not; and (b) what is the number and percentage of signalised junctions with shared green time on Singapore roads to date.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: There are about 1,500 signalised junctions with shared green time. This is about 90% of all signalised junctions. Such junctions allow vehicles to turn when there are no pedestrians crossing during the green man phase, ensuring smoother traffic flow on our roads.Over the last 10 years, there were on average about three fatal accidents and 40 injury accidents per year at signalised junctions involving a pedestrian or cyclist, and vehicles turning right during the green man phase. However, we do not have the breakdown of whether these accidents occurred at junctions with or without shared green time.To enhance pedestrians' safety at signalised junctions with shared green time, LTA has adjusted traffic light timings to give pedestrians a head start in crossing the road. LTA has also installed lighted road studs as well as additional road markings and signs at higher risk junctions to remind motorists to give way."
assisting flat owners beyond defects liability period,"Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for National Development how can the Ministry assist HDB flat dwellers faced with defects that arise from design inadequacies and poor workmanship beyond the defects liability period, including assisting with the costs of repair works.","Mr Lawrence Wong: When residents move into their flats and report any defects to HDB during the one-year Defects Liability Period (DLP), HDB will arrange for the contractor to carry out the necessary repairs. The one-year DLP is an industry-wide practice, and is aligned with that for private developments.If any maintenance issue is reported after the DLP, HDB will first investigate the likely cause and advise flat owners on the follow-up action accordingly. If the issue is assessed to arise from workmanship of the building contractor, it is considered a defect and HDB will recall the building contractor to rectify it. However, if the issue is due to wear and tear or flat owners' own actions, flat owners will be responsible for any rectification works. If the flat owners need HDB’s help, HDB can provide them with a list of repair contractors, whom they can then engage on a private basis."
singapore's review of vehicle entry permit and toll charges for foreign-registered vehicles,"Mr Ang Wei Neng asked Minister for Transport in light of the announcement by the Malaysian Government to impose a vehicle entry permit (VEP) fee on top of the road charge currently imposed on foreign-registered vehicles entering Malaysia from Singapore, whether the Ministry will review the VEP fee and toll charges for foreign-registered vehicles entering Singapore.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Although Malaysia's Vehicle Entry Permit (VEP) shares the same name as Singapore's VEP, they serve different purposes. Singapore’s VEP fee is to equalise the cost of owning and using a Malaysia-registered vehicle in Singapore with that of a Singapore-registered vehicle. Malaysia’s VEP fee, on the other hand, appears to be intended to recover the cost of radio-frequency identification (RFID) cards from users of foreign vehicles entering Malaysia. Malaysia has also announced that it will implement the VEP fee at the Causeway, the Second Link and the Malaysia-Thailand borders from end-2017, and at the Malaysia-Brunei and Malaysia-Indonesia borders in 2018.There are no plans to introduce a reciprocal charge for now. We will monitor Malaysia’s implementation of the VEP."
child safety seats requirement for private hire cars but not for taxis,"Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry asked Minister for Transport (a) why it is necessary for private hire cars to have child safety seats when it is not required for taxis; (b) how many child safety seats are needed for private hire cars, especially when passengers may have more than one child travelling with them; and (c) whether there can be more policy consistency for private hire cars and taxis on this matter.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: For safety reasons, the Traffic Police requires any passenger below 1.35 metres in height to be properly secured by an approved child restraint or booster seat. However, taxis are exempted from this rule because they can be street-hailed, and it would not be practical to expect them to be equipped with child restraints or boosters seat at all times, or to reject passengers with infants or children.In comparison, private hire cars are pre-booked, and passengers can indicate upfront if they require child restraints or booster seats."
studies on installation of sound barriers along expressways,Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for Transport (a) what has been the results of LTA's studies on the installation of sound barriers along expressways where there are high densities of public housing; and (b) what are the possible additional measures that can be taken to reduce the intense noise from expressway traffic such as that along KJE and BKE where there are large numbers of noise-emitting motorcycles and lorries from Malaysia.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: LTA is conducting trials on the effectiveness of noise barriers along West Coast Highway, certain stretches of PIE, as well as a new flyover along Braddell Road. Preliminary results have been positive.Aside from noise barriers, LTA is also studying a road surface material that can dampen traffic noise levels."
review of code of practice for vehicle parking provision in buildings,"Mr Ang Wei Neng asked the Minister for Transport in the light of the removal of the growth rate component in the COE supply formula, whether the Ministry will review the Code of Practice for vehicle parking provision in developments especially in commercial buildings within the Central Business District.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: We currently already allow certain developments located in the city centre the flexibility to provide up to 20% less than the prescribed vehicle parking standards. Given the improvements that we have made to public transport and first-last mile connectivity in recent years, we are also reviewing the vehicle parking standards for developments in areas well-connected to public transport, including the Central Business District."
impact of heat on workforce and productivity given global warming,"Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) in light of global warming and temperatures rising on a yearly basis (a) whether the Ministry is exploring the impact of the heat on our workforce and productivity, particularly labour-intensive industries that work in the outdoors; and (b) how well-equipped is our workforce to cope with the impact of climate change in the medium to long term.","Mr S Iswaran: The Government is monitoring the rising temperatures in Singapore and its impact on our workforce and economy. Workers in Construction, Landscaping, Marine & Offshore Engineering and some parts of Logistics are involved in more outdoor work.Companies in these sectors have put in place mitigating measures tailored to their respective operating context. For example, in the Marine industry, companies use mobile shelters where possible to shield workers from direct sunlight as they move along the production line. Construction and Landscape companies equip workers with loose and cool clothing, and ensure outdoor workers have access to drinking facilities throughout the day. Even in warehousing, which is largely sheltered nowadays, companies are increasingly using air-conditioning or large fans to reduce indoor temperatures. Under the Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Act and Regulations, employers are required to take these and other reasonable measures to minimise the risk of heat stress among their workers. The WSH Council has also published guidelines for managing heat stress, which include a 14-day heat acclimatisation programme in the first two weeks of employment, and adequate work-rest cycles.For the medium to longer term, the Government is working with industry to adopt technologies and improve work processes that will reduce labour-intensive outdoor work. For instance, as part of the Construction Industry Transformation Map, companies are encouraged to pre-fabricate building components off-site, so that less time is spent on wet work on-site, where workers are exposed to the elements. Marine companies are adopting more robotics and automation in areas like hull blasting and painting. Various Government agencies also support R&D efforts to mitigate the impact of heat stress in urban Singapore."
prevention of incidents involving falling objects from rooftop gardens and open balconies,"Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for National Development in respect of trees, plants, furniture and objects on rooftop gardens and open balconies (a) how many incidences have there been in the last five years involving these objects being blown off due to strong winds; (b) whether there have been any consequent injuries, fatalities or property damage; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider more stringent regulations and enforcement to prevent future incidents.","Mr Lawrence Wong: The Ministry has not received reports of trees, plants, or furniture blown off rooftop gardens and open balconies in the last five years. But there were three cases of poorly affixed plastic roof sheets that were blown off from building trellis structures due to strong winds. Fortunately, no injuries or damage arose from these cases.Building owners are responsible for the safety of features installed on their roofs and terraces. All bracings, mounting systems and fixings used to secure the installation of building features should be properly designed and able to withstand loads from wind and rain in accordance with current building codes. Last year, BCA issued an advisory to remind stakeholders of the need for proper installation and maintenance of such features. We will continue to review regulations, and will tighten them if necessary, to ensure that public safety is not compromised.Owners and tenants also need to take the potential threat of falling objects from high rise buildings seriously. All of us should exercise duty of care, and have the civic responsibility to ensure that loose and lightweight items like outdoor furniture and flower pots are properly secured, and not placed in a manner that could pose a threat to public safety.If an object falls from height and endangers safety, or causes hurt or death, the person responsible could be liable for an offence under the Penal Code. Depending on the severity of the offence, a person could be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to five years, or with a fine, or with both."
generalists to help meet singapore's future healthcare needs,"Dr Tan Wu Meng asked the Minister for Health how can the Ministry (i) strengthen and empower family physicians, general practitioners, internists and other doctors playing a generalist co-ordinating physician role to meet Singapore's future healthcare needs and (ii) ensure graduate medical training has flexibility amidst structure so that young doctors can build generalist experience without worrying whether relevant prior experience is disadvantaged if a training path is chosen later rather than sooner.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Generalist doctors play a central role in providing patient-centric and holistic care for an ageing population.To strengthen and empower generalist doctors, MOH is investing in training and development of broad based professional competencies for all doctors. We plan to incorporate a set of core clinical curriculum of generalist skillsets in our medical schools’ undergraduate curriculum. For postgraduate training, efforts are underway to define the generalist competencies that should be integrated into the training programmes for specialists. For example, a mandatory Geriatric Medicine Modular Training Programme for non-Internal Medicine residents2 has been instituted as part of Residency training to equip residents with the necessary skills of managing elderly patients within their respective specialties.We noted Dr Tan's comments on allowing flexibility in recognising generalist experience of doctors so that they are not disadvantaged when selecting their training path later. This is already the case for specialties with an Internal Medicine background where doctors spend three years in generalist Internal Medicine training before selecting one of the 15 different specialties for further training. The Ministry will study further if there is similar need for surgical specialties."
use of public spaces by private outdoor educators under national outdoor adventure education masterplan,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for National Development with regard to the Ministry of Education's new national outdoor adventure education masterplan (a) whether private outdoor educators are allowed to use public spaces for their activities; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider allowing private outdoor educators easier access to public spaces for their activities.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Our public spaces are meant to be used and enjoyed by everyone. Apart from parks and park connector networks, we have progressively opened up reservoirs and waterways for sporting and recreational activities.Our parks are open to members of the public, including private outdoor education providers, as long as the activity does not deprive other public users of the space. Currently, for activities that are organised for more than 15 people, ticketed, or require structural set-up, members of the public can apply to use our parks through the online Park Usage Application System.NParks will allow activities that do not cause undue disruption to the public, or potential damage to flora and fauna in our parks. Users must also adhere to the rules and regulations stipulated in the Parks and Trees Act.Our reservoirs are restricted facilities. However, PUB will consider applications from private organisations to carry out water activities in our reservoirs on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the impact on PUB's operations, potential pollution to the water and surroundings, and safety of participants.We will continue to support the use of our public spaces by private outdoor adventure education providers, as long as the proposed activities do not compromise our agencies’ operations, and the impact to our environment and other members of the public is minimised."
cause of train fault along downtown line between bukit panjang and beauty world stations,Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the cause of the train fault along the DTL2 line between the Bukit Panjang and Beauty World stations on 16 October 2017; and (b) why has this disruption affected train services along the DTL3 line during the DTL3 Open House on the same day.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The incident happened on Oct 15 at about 12:40pm, due to a broken track circuit cable lug between Hillview and Beauty World Stations. The track circuit fault caused a DTL2 train to stall, moments after leaving Cashew Station for Hillview station. It had to be manually driven back to Cashew station and all passengers were de-trained safely. Normal train services resumed at 1:20pm.While the fault occurred on DTL2, we decided to temporarily suspend the injection of trains into DTL3, so as to avoid congestion on DTL2. This has affected the DTL3 Open House but overall the Open House was a great success, attracting 360,000 visitors. They familiarised themselves with DTL3 and were clearly enthusiastic. DTL3 officially commenced service on Oct 21, and DTL now serves some 420,000 commuter trips daily on weekdays. This has been a major milestone for us and a great achievement for the DTL team."
rollout schedule for business grant portal for smes,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (a) what is the rollout schedule for the business grant portal for SMEs; (b) what are the types of schemes that will be put on the portal; and (c) whether key schemes run by the Ministry of Manpower can be inserted in the first few stage of the rollout.,"Mr S Iswaran: The Business Grants Portal (BGP) benefits companies, including SMEs, by simplifying grant application forms, and reducing the need for companies to approach multiple agencies when applying for business grants.BGP was launched in January 2017, and companies can now apply for six business grants administered by five different government agencies. These include SPRING Singapore's Capability Development Grant (CDG), and IE Singapore's Market Readiness Assistance (MRA) grant. The BGP has generally been well received by businesses, with more than 7,000 grant applications from over 5,000 companies submitted through the portal.We will continue to find ways to allow more companies to benefit from the streamlined grant application process offered by the BGP. As part of the review for future rollouts, MTI's Grant Management Office is working with government agencies, such as the Ministry of Manpower, to explore what other grants can be added to the BGP, especially those with high application volume."
sum insured under compulsory hdb fire insurance scheme,"Mr Ang Wei Neng asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the number of fire incidents involving HDB flats in the past five years; (b) of these, how many flats were a total loss in respect of the sum insured under the HDB Fire Insurance Scheme; (c) what is the frequency of the Ministry's review of the sum insured under the compulsory HDB Fire Insurance Scheme; and (d) whether the current sum insured is adequate to cover the cost of reinstating damaged internal structures, fixtures and areas built and provided by HDB.","Mr Lawrence Wong: All flat owners with an outstanding HDB loan are required to take up a basic fire insurance policy under the HDB Fire Insurance Scheme. It provides coverage for the reinstatement cost of the building structures and fixtures, in the event of a fire.In the last five years, there were a total of 640 fire incidents, involving less than 0.1% of HDB’s stock of sold flats. Of these, 448 cases (or 70%) were covered under the HDB Fire Insurance Scheme. In all of these cases, the sum insured fully covered the claims to reinstate damaged internal structures, fixtures and areas built. The sum insured under the HDB Fire Insurance Scheme is thus adequate.HDB calls a tender to appoint an insurer for the Fire Insurance Scheme for each five-year term, during which HDB will review the sum insured for each flat type."
free sunday parking at new bto projects,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry asked ask the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry can extend free Sunday parking to all new BTO projects for both mature and non-mature HDB estates.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB car parks are provided primarily to serve the parking needs of residents. For this reason, HDB will only consider extending the Free Parking Scheme (FPS) on Sundays and public holidays at all newly completed precincts, after parking demand from the new residents has stabilised. This is generally about six months after parking charges are implemented for the car park.This will ensure that there are sufficient parking lots to support both the residents' needs as well as the expected increase in demand for parking due to FPS. It also avoids a situation where the FPS has to be withdrawn subsequently due to insufficient parking spaces for the residents."
ensuring lights used on emergency vehicles are safe for other drivers,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether there are regulations to ensure that the type of lights used on emergency vehicles are safe for other drivers who may be blinded by these lights; and (b) whether the number and brightness of the lights can be adjusted based on weather conditions and other environmental factors.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Under the Road Traffic Act, emergency vehicles such as ambulances, fire-fighting vehicles or police vehicles can only switch on their warning lights during emergencies to warn other vehicles to give way. Like other international jurisdictions, such as Japan, Australia, and the United Kingdom, we do not regulate the number and brightness of the warning lights."
anti-smoking messages in schools and reducing accessibility of cigarettes to minors,"Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling asked the Minister for Health (a) apart from the cost of nicotine replacement treatments, what are the other factors that prevent smokers from quitting smoking; (b) what are the current programmes introduced in schools and tertiary institutions to discourage students from picking up smoking; and (c) how has the Ministry worked with other agencies to enforce and reduce accessibility of cigarettes to minors.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Health Promotion Board (HPB) offers a range of smoking cessation programmes under the I Quit campaign to support smokers to quit smoking. However, because smoking is addictive, smokers have to be disciplined and determined and many may need to try a few times before succeeding, particularly those who have been smoking for a long period of time.We discourage people, especially the young, from even starting to smoke through a multi-agency, multi-prong approach, including through tobacco control legislation and public education.For example, HPB works closely with the Ministry of Education (MOE) to incorporate anti-tobacco messages in schools and institutes of higher learning. The aim is to raise awareness about the benefits of leading a tobacco-free lifestyle, highlight the adverse effects of smoking, and equip youth with life skills to refuse cigarette offers. To help youths who are already smoking, smoking cessation support is provided through counselling by Student Health Advisors based in 50 schools, school-based smoking cessation programme as well as telephone counselling by Quitline. Those who need help can call 1800 438 2000.It is illegal to sell tobacco to under-aged persons and we are planning to raise the minimum legal age (MLA) from 18 to 21 as outlined in the Tobacco (Control of Advertisements and Sale) (Amendment) Bill which will be tabled for second reading shortly. To curb supplies of tobacco to under-aged persons, the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) conducts surveillance on tobacco retailers for tobacco sales to under-aged persons and investigates feedback from the public and leads from partner agencies.The penalty for selling tobacco products to under-aged persons is a maximum fine upon conviction of $5,000, and $10,000 for subsequent offences. In addition, the tobacco retail licence will also be suspended or revoked. Persons who give or buy tobacco for under-aged persons are also liable to a fine upon conviction.The Ministry of Health will continue its efforts to prevent people from starting to smoke, and to help those who are already smoking to quit."
update on review into criminal justice system for youths,Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what is the status of the review into the Criminal Justice System for Youths started in October 2015; (b) whether the Government has decided on raising the threshold age under the Children and Young Persons Act from 16 years to 18 years; and (c) what are the pending issues that have delayed the Government's conclusions on this matter.,"Mr Desmond Lee: In Oct 2015, the Attorney-General's Chambers chaired an inter-agency committee to review the youth justice system. The committee made several recommendations in Feb 2017, including working towards increasing the age limit under the Children and Young Persons Act (CYPA) to allow youths aged 16 to below 18 years to benefit from a wider range of sentencing options.The Government is working through the recommendations, as part of the wider review of the CYPA.The CYPA is one component of the youth justice system. Youth justice in Singapore, as a whole, is premised on gradated intervention. Our approach is to divert youth offenders, including those aged between 16 and 18 years, away from the Court wherever possible. Placing youth offenders on diversionary programmes outside the youth justice system allows them to be accountable for their actions, and prevents disruption in other areas of development such as education.Operationally, the triage system sieves out and diverts suitable youths who have been arrested for minor offences. These youths are then referred to diversionary programmes such as the Guidance Programme, Enhanced Streetwise, and Youth Enhanced Supervision. The parents of the youths are actively involved in the programmes, which are also offered to youths aged above 16 years. The intent is to help the youths develop better self-control and make better decisions.Youth offenders who are not diverted are assessed for suitability to be placed on probation. Probation focuses on community-based rehabilitation and the Court may order accompanying conditions depending on the needs of the youth offenders. For example, a probationer may be given a curfew or be ordered to reside in a hostel. The State Court may also order other community-based sentences such as mandatory treatment for mental health conditions, regular reporting to a centre and community service."
measures to prevent misuse of information exchanged,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Finance (a) whether there are any conflicts between existing legislation on personal data protection and banking secrecy and tax information exchanged under the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (MCAA) on the Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information for the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) and the Exchange of Country-by-Country (CbC) Reports as established by OECD; and (b) what are the measures in place to safeguard the privacy of individuals and to prevent misuse of the information exchanged.,"Mr Heng Swee Keat: There is no conflict between existing legislation on personal data protection and banking secrecy, and tax information exchanged under the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (MCAA) on the Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information (or AEOI) for the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) and the Exchange of Country-by-Country (CbC) Reports.The AEOI under the CRS and the Exchange of CbC Reports are internationally agreed standards. These standards are observed by many countries which continue to operate their respective data protection and privacy policies. For example, jurisdictions which have data protection and privacy policies, such as Switzerland and EU member states, have also endorsed these internationally agreed standards. Singapore's signing of the multilateral agreements for both standards is in line with our commitment to the internationally agreed standards on tax cooperation against cross-border tax evasion.The multilateral agreements for AEOI of CRS and CbC reports contain provisions which ensure that the information exchanged is kept confidential and used only for the specific purposes set out in the agreements. Exchange of information that are frivolous or spurious in nature or ""fishing expeditions"" are prohibited under internationally agreed standards for exchange of information.For instance, a party to the MCAA is to provide information to the other party only if that other party has the legal and administrative framework to ensure the confidentiality of information exchanged and prevent its unauthorised use. Where there is any breach of confidentiality, exchange of information can be suspended.To implement the internationally agreed standards for the automatic exchange of information and fulfil Singapore's obligations under these agreements, the Income Tax Act was amended in 2013 and 2016. The amendments include the duty for specified persons to provide information to the Comptroller, and for this duty to provide information to prevail over the duty of secrecy provided for under written law or rule of law, including the Banking Act, the Personal Data Protection Act 2012, any contract, or rules of professional conduct.

pioneer generation office's outreach efforts,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar asked the Minister for Finance (a) whether an update can be provided on the Pioneer Generation Office's outreach efforts towards seniors in the current third wave of engagement; and (b) whether there are enough PG ambassadors to carry out the outreach efforts to our seniors.,"Mr Heng Swee Keat: The Pioneer Generation Office (PGO) was established in August 2014 to oversee the Pioneer Generation (PG) Ambassadors Programme. PG Ambassadors, who are volunteers, carry out personalised outreach to Pioneers and their caregivers to explain the various government schemes.In August 2016, PGO extended its outreach to 90,000 more Singaporean citizens aged 65 and above (in addition to only Pioneers), and began its third wave of engagement through its Support Schemes for Seniors (SFS) programme. This programme aims to help seniors understand relevant Government schemes beyond the Pioneer Generation Package and Medishield Life. These schemes include the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS), Silver Support Scheme (SSS) and GST Voucher scheme.Between August 2016 and September 2017, the PG Ambassadors successfully engaged close to 350,000 seniors, or more than two-thirds of the total senior population. PGO also supported the Community Networks for Seniors (CNS) pilot in Tampines, Marine Parade and Chua Chu Kang GRCs. In the three pilot sites, the PG Ambassadors referred more than 800 unique seniors to relevant agencies for follow-up. These cases are seniors with multiple needs that require case management.PGO has over 3,000 trained PG Ambassadors. Presently, the pool of volunteers is sufficient to maintain its engagement activities. In anticipation of a higher volume of engagement in the future due to the ageing population, PGO is actively recruiting more volunteers by establishing new partnerships with partner agencies such as the National Volunteering and Philanthropy Council (NVPC), Council for Third Age (C3A) and RSVP Singapore. We hope that more people who are keen or interested to help in reaching out to our seniors will step forward as PG Ambassadors."
career paths of former gep students,"Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for Education (Schools) (a) how many students have undergone the Gifted Education Programme (GEP) each year in the past five years; (b) whether any study has been done to track the career path of those who underwent the GEP since its inception in 1984 and, if so, what has been the outcome; and (c) whether the GEP has been tweaked to meet the changing needs of education.","Mr Ng Chee Meng: Over the past five years, about 1% of the age cohort were admitted into the Gifted Education Programme (GEP) at Primary 4 each year.Based on longitudinal data collected from several batches of GEP graduates, they have done well. As a group, they have not only excelled academically but also performed strongly in non-academic areas.Our first few cohorts are now in their forties. They hold diverse portfolios in both the public and private sectors. Among those in the private sector, some were founders, managing partners or CEOs of their organisations. Others have also become established leaders in their respective fields, such as senior consultants in the medical field, senior partners in law firms or senior Directors in the public service.The GEP is reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that it continues to meet developmental needs of our students and prepare them well for the future."
cold chain integrity of drugs,"Ms K Thanaletchimi asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the Health Sciences Authority will mandate manufacturers, suppliers and pharmacies to monitor the temperature of pharmaceutical drugs from their source to the patient so as to preserve the cold chain integrity of the drugs; and (b) whether the Ministry provides strict guidelines for suppliers and distributors to observe and include the provision of temperature loggers as evidence of cold chain storage compliance to ensure the potency of their drugs.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) requires all drug manufacturers, importers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies to keep their drugs in proper storage conditions, including cold chain storage under appropriate temperature where necessary. The drugs are also required to be distributed using validated processes to ensure cold chain storage is maintained.The companies can use different ways to measure and monitor the temperature, such as temperature loggers, or more sophisticated electronic facility management systems.3HSA conducts regular on-site inspections of the premises of the drug manufacturers, importers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies to assure that the regulatory requirements are complied with. During the inspections, HSA checks the raw data captured by the temperature monitoring devices or facility management systems to verify good temperature controls."
review list of birds for sale as pets to restrict sale of endangered species,Mr Yee Chia Hsing asked the Minister for National Development how frequently does AVA review the list of birds available for sale as pets to ensure that the sale of species which are becoming endangered or threatened is restricted.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority (AVA) regularly reviews the list of birds available for sale as pets in Singapore. This is based on the requirements of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), to which Singapore is a Party. CITES classifies species according to the degree of protection that they require. Depending on how critically endangered they are, species are categorised under three CITES Appendices which restrict or even prohibit their trade. CITES amends its listings at the Conference of Parties once every three years. Following which, AVA reviews the list of birds available for sale in Singapore.AVA conducts checks on bird shops in Singapore to ensure compliance. Stern enforcement action will be taken against anyone found to be illegally selling endangered species, including birds. Offenders are liable for a fine of up to $500,000, and/or imprisonment of up to two years."
police posts within compound of essential services such as hospitals,Ms K Thanaletchimi asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether the Ministry will consider establishing police posts within the compound of essential services such as hospitals to provide easy access to immediate reporting when terror incidents are reported.,"Mr K Shanmugam: In the event of a terror attack, affected members of the public should ""run, hide, tell"". When it is safe to do so, the public should call 999, send a text message (SMS) to 71999 if it is not safe to talk, or provide the information through the SGSecure app. There is no need nor time to physically make a report at a police post.Our security forces will respond as quickly as possible. Police Officers and Auxiliary Police Officers in the vicinity, as well as Police's Emergency Response Teams (ERTs), will be among the first to arrive on scene. The ERTs conduct high-visibility patrols at locations with heavy human traffic, including hospitals, to deter would-be attackers, and to be able to respond quickly to incidents."
student applications for exemption from mother tongue subject,Mr Darryl David asked the Minister for Education (Schools) for the past five years (a) how many primary school students have sought exemption from being assessed on their mother tongue subjects due to learning difficulties based on diagnosed conditions; and (b) how many of such cases have been approved by the Ministry.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: A student with special needs may be considered for exemption from Mother Tongue Language (MTL) if he or she has been certified with Special Educational Needs that severely affect the student's ability to cope with MTL and with overall learning.Over the past five years, around 2% of the PSLE cohort received MTL exemption each year due to special educational needs.Students with special educational needs who are coping with their overall studies but have difficulty with the Standard MTL curriculum can consider the option of offering MTL at a lower level. The Foundation MTL curriculum at Primary 5 and 6, and the MTL 'B' curriculum at Secondary and Junior College levels are focused on the development of oral and listening skills, and have a much reduced demand on writing skills."
opportunities for local enterprises in government tenders,"Ms K Thanaletchimi asked the Minister for Finance whether opportunities are given to local SMEs for government tenders and, if so, how extensive is the support given for local SMEs and local entrepreneurs in this aspect.","Mr Heng Swee Keat: SMEs1 have been successful in securing government projects under our open procurement system. In 2015 and 2016, more than 80% of the contracts called by government agencies were awarded to SMEs. These contracts make up about half of the total value of all contracts awarded in the same period. Of the contracts awarded to SMEs, about 90% were won by SMEs that have at least 50% local equity.As the vast majority of government contracts are below $100,000 in value, there are significant opportunities for smaller enterprises to participate in government procurement. To facilitate participation in government procurement, the first GeBIZ account is free, and this allows suppliers to view procurement opportunities and submit their bids electronically. There are also existing platforms such as GeBIZ Mall, which provides electronic ""shelf-space"" for suppliers to publicise their goods or services and for government agencies to buy directly from them.The Ministry of Finance and government agencies also participate in outreach events, such as the Government Procurement Fair for SMEs organised by the Singapore Business Federation, to help SMEs gain a better understanding of government procurement processes.There is also targeted support in specific industries. For example, the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) established the Accreditation@IMDA Programme in 2014 to nurture Singapore-based innovative technology startups and SMEs. Under this programme, 23 Singapore-based suppliers have been accredited. To-date, more than 120 government contracts have been won by accredited suppliers. Private sector buyers and investors have also shown interest in accredited suppliers due to the assurance provided by the work performed and track record built through this programme.Under the enhanced Partnership for Capability Transformation through Government-lead demand, also known as Gov-PACT, government agencies will identify problem statements that require innovative solutions that do not yet exist in the market, and issue calls for proposals to the industry to develop and test-bed such solutions. Local SMEs and start-ups whose proposals are accepted are eligible for up to 70% funding support from SPRING Singapore for qualifying development costs. Gov-PACT enables our local enterprises to strengthen their innovation capabilities as they co-create and prototype innovative products and services for the public sector. This allows them to build track record with the Singapore Government as a reference customer, and catalyse their growth. Since the programme was launched in April 2017, two calls for proposals have been launched by JTC and NEA to good response from local SMEs.Beyond government procurement opportunities, the Government also supports SMEs in many other ways, including through capability development, access to working capital and financing, and skills training for their workforce."
measures to ensure childcare operators are financially sound,"Ms Tin Pei Ling asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) over the past five years, how many early childhood education and care centres have suffered financial woes or have been insolvent; and (b) whether the Government will consider putting in place a student fee protection scheme for these centres similar to the one required under the Private Education Act.","30 Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) whether the criteria for issuing licences to operators of childcare centres are adequate to ensure that the operators are financially responsible to safeguard the fees paid by parents and the salaries of staff; (b) whether a screening process and safeguards will be established to ensure that only responsible operators are issued with the necessary licences; and (c) how many childcare centres have recently defaulted on salaries owed to teachers or fees collected from parents.Mr Desmond Lee: The Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) regulates preschools to ensure the safety, well-being and development of our young children enrolled in these preschools. In determining whether to issue or renew a licence under the Child Care Centre Act, ECDA assesses the centre’s standards in providing holistic early childhood development programmes in a safe environment. This includes looking at physical space norms and designs, environment safety and hygiene, programme staff quality and staff-to-child ratio. In addition, ECDA also considers the character and fitness of the applicant or licensee, such as whether he or she had committed child-related offences previously.In this context, ECDA will intervene decisively if operations are affected in a way that poses risks to the safety and well-being of children. For more complex cases, ECDA may work with other government agencies to carry out investigations. In the event that centres abruptly close, ECDA will assist parents with alternative placement for their children, if needed. The number of abrupt preschool closures has been low – about three annually, on average over the last three years, and we will closely monitor this trend.Under the new Early Childhood Development Centres Act, which was enacted in April this year and which will be brought into force next year, ECDA will have enhanced authority to take into account the financial capacity of applicants in operating and maintaining such a centre. This will be one of the factors that ECDA will look at in determining whether a license is to be awarded or renewed. Such upstream intervention will go some way in reducing the risk of operators abruptly defaulting on fees paid by parents or salaries owed to teachers.There are other approaches that can help protect parents from fee defaults arising from sudden closure, such as a student fee protection scheme, as suggested by Ms Tin Pei Ling. We will study the options carefully, taking into account the context and, possible trade-offs such as added costs to the sector and to parents.Under employment laws, it is an offence not to pay salaries and provide Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions. The Ministry of Manpower and CPF Board will investigate such cases."
grooming talent for clean technology,"Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (a) what is being done to groom local talents with the right skills and education for the relevant jobs in our goal to become Asia's clean technology hub; (b) of these jobs, how many are estimated to be applicable to Singaporeans; and (c) how will increased focus on clean technology impact our economy.","Mr S Iswaran: Singapore aims to be Asia's leading clean technology (or cleantech) hub to develop domestic solutions and to access the economic opportunities in the region. Our cleantech companies, mainly in the areas of clean energy and water, undertake a wide range of business activities, creating jobs in research and development (R&D), engineering, project development and financing, and high-value manufacturing. Members would be familiar with our success story of improving self-reliance for water. Clean energy, particularly solar energy, will also have a positive impact to our economy both as an economically viable and sustainable energy source, and as an exportable solution to other cities.The cleantech industry currently hires more than 20,000 workers. In 2016, we projected that the water sector could add 1,000 new PMET jobs by 2020. This year, we also announced plans for the clean energy sector, which is projected to add 2,000 new PMET jobs by 2025. At least two-thirds of these jobs are projected to be taken up by Singaporeans.Cleantech is part of the Urban Solutions domain which has been identified as a key growth area by the Committee on the Future Economy (CFE), as well as a focus of our Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2020 (RIE2020) Plan. To deepen our knowledge and capability in this field, the Government is supporting public research centres, such as the Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore (SERIS), the Energy Research Institute @ NTU (ERI@N), and the Nanyang Environment and Water Research Institute (NEWRI), to undertake industry-aligned R&D which create additional good jobs in themselves, and help train technical talent for the wider industry.The Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) and the Energy Market Authority (EMA) also have various initiatives to groom local talent for companies including in-company training, student scholarships, and talent outreach activities such as learning journeys. Taking clean energy as an example, some of our talent grooming and skills upgrading initiatives include the Energy-Industry and Singapore-Industry Scholarships. Since 2014, EMA has supported these scholarships for students in ITEs, polytechnics, and universities, in partnership with sponsoring organisations from the power sector. Since July 2016, early and mid-career Singaporeans in the industry have also been tapping on the SkillsFuture Study Award for the Power Sector, to deepen their engineering skills though supported tertiary education courses.We will continue to grow the cleantech industry by investing in research and innovation, training skilled manpower, and promoting new financing and business models."
assessment of uber's security measures,Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for Transport in light of Uber being denied licence renewal in London due to security and safety concerns (a) whether LTA has conducted assessments on Uber's security measures; (b) how satisfactory are those measures; (c) how many accidents and safety issues has Uber been involved in the past one year; and (d) what further measures will be implemented to improve safety and reliability of private-hire car operators in Singapore.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: We take commuter safety seriously. We rely primarily on the Private Hire Car Driver's Vocational Licence (PDVL) scheme, rather than the efforts of Uber or other ride platforms, to protect our commuters.As part of the application process for a PDVL, LTA will screen the candidate's background and driving records. Individuals who have committed violent crimes or serious driving offences will be disqualified. Applicants are also required to attend courses and pass the requisite tests to ensure that they have the knowledge and skills. In addition, PDVL holders who are suspected of committing or are convicted of serious criminal or driving-related offences may have their PDVLs suspended or revoked.On their part, private hire car booking service operators need to ensure that only licensed drivers and cars are deployed on their platforms. LTA can serve a General Suspension Order on private-hire car booking service operators whose drivers have been convicted for three times over a 12-month period. The nature of convictions include (a) providing private hire car services without a valid vocational licence, (b) using an unlicensed vehicle to provide services, or (c) using a private hire car that is inappropriately insured.Last year, drivers for private-hire car booking service operators and traditional limousine companies were involved in about 700 road accidents. These accidents could have happened when the driver was driving for hire and reward, or in his personal capacity. There were also nine instances where drivers for private-hire car booking service operators were arrested for commuter-related crimes.We review our policies regularly to ensure that they are effective in ensuring commuter safety."
implementation of tripartite advisory for managing workplace harassment,"Mr Kok Heng Leun asked the Minister for Manpower how many employers have implemented the Tripartite Advisory for managing workplace harassment, both in having a policy explicitly defining harassment including sexual harassment, and setting out how it will be handled, as well as providing training to workers on how to prevent and respond to it.","Mr Lim Swee Say: The Tripartite Advisory on Managing Workplace Harassment was issued in December 2015 to serve as a practical guide for employers and employees to better prevent and manage harassment at the workplace. The advisory helps foster workplace environments where harassment is not tolerated, and educates workers who face harassment on where to seek help including remedies available under the Protection from Harassment Act (POHA).Tripartite advisories are meant to provide a guide for employers and employees, and are not prescriptive. We do not track how many companies have adopted the measures suggested in the advisories, including that on Managing Workplace Harassment.In the last three years, fewer than five of the 800 of the complaints lodged with the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices, or TAFEP, involved allegations of workplace harassment. Each of these complaints were looked into, with TAFEP advising the complainant on possible means to seek recourse. TAFEP also followed up with the employers, for substantiated complaints, to highlight the feedback received and advise them to take corrective actions where necessary.On an ongoing basis, NTUC, SNEF and TAFEP conduct regular courses to help employers adopt policies to prevent and manage workplace harassment. More than 450 company representatives have been trained over the last two years.MOM and TAFEP will continue to monitor the situation and take each report of alleged workplace harassment seriously. We urge workers who face workplace harassment to get help promptly. This includes reporting to the authorities such as the Police for criminal offences or the Court for civil remedies."
allowing estate agents to refuse instructions from clients who exclude or favour prospective tenants based on race or nationality,Mr Kok Heng Leun asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry will consider requiring estate agents licensed by the Council of Estate Agents to (i) refuse to place advertisements that exclude or favour groups of prospective tenants based on race or nationality and (ii) refuse instructions from clients who seek to exclude or favour such groups.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: CEA’s regulatory guidelines require property agents to be sensitive to Singapore’s diverse social fabric. Property agents are not allowed to place advertisements that are discriminatory, offensive, or stereotype any particular race, religion or group in society. They are also not allowed to indicate a preference for any ethnicity in all advertisements, unless for compliance with government regulations such as the Ethnic Integration Policy. It is the duty of property agents to inform their clients of the need to adhere to these guidelines.Property agents who breach any of these guidelines can either be issued a written warning, or be subjected to disciplinary action which may result in suspension or revocation of licence or registration."
supporting efforts to restore peace and stability in myanmar's rakhine state,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs (a) how does Singapore intend to support the government of Myanmar in restoring peace and stability in the Rakhine state; (b) how important is it to Singapore (as chair of ASEAN in 2018) and ASEAN in responding to the urgent situation in Rakhine or conflict in any member states that may threaten the stability of the region; and (c) whether the Government of Singapore will consider providing humanitarian assistance through the government of Bangladesh given that Bangladesh will build a refugee camp for more than 400,000 displaced Rohingya refugees.","26 Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs (a) what is the Government's assessment of the humanitarian tragedy facing the Rohingya population in Myanmar; and (b) whether there is a constructive role that ASEAN can play to address the crisis.Dr Vivian Balakrishnan: Mr Louis Ng and Mr Pritam Singh's questions relate to the situation in Rakhine State. Mr Christopher De Souza and Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar also posed related questions at yesterday's Sitting. I will address the four questions in my reply this afternoon.In Myanmar's Northern Rakhine State, a humanitarian disaster has unfolded in the aftermath of a terrorist attack on 25 August 2017 and subsequent related acts of violence. The conflict has resulted in loss of lives, destruction of homes and the displacement of large numbers of people. The situation in the Rakhine State is a complex inter-communal issue with deep historical roots, dating back more than half a century. There are no quick-fixes. The immediate task at hand is for all the parties involved to cease actions that will further worsen the situation on the ground, so that humanitarian assistance can reach those desperately in need regardless of ethnicity and religious affiliation. We urge the restoration of peace, stability and the rule of law in the Rakhine State. It is the responsibility of every government to protect every civilian and to restore law and order. Comprehensive, long-term and sustainable solutions must also be found to address the underlying challenges and build trust among the different stakeholders and communities, and define the legal status of everyone in Rakhine State. As a close friend and neighbour, Singapore stands ready to support the Myanmar government in whatever way we can to make a positive contribution.Given the scale of the humanitarian needs, the Singapore Government will be offering bilateral humanitarian aid to both Myanmar and Bangladesh. We hope to contribute to the efforts to help all affected communities on both sides of the border regardless of ethnicity and religion. For Myanmar, we will be offering an aid package comprising approximately S$100,000 worth of supplies from the Singapore Government. For Bangladesh, given that it is experiencing a more severe refugee crisis, we will be offering two humanitarian loads comprising approximately S$200,000 worth of supplies from the Singapore Government.Our community organisations have also launched fundraising drives for the affected communities in Rakhine State. I would like to highlight three such organisations in my reply.The first is the Singapore Red Cross (SRC), which has been providing humanitarian assistance in Rakhine State since 2012. The SRC has launched a month-long public fundraising appeal1 and committed S$27,150 worth of relief items to be distributed in Rakhine State. This is in addition to an earlier contribution of US$50,000 in shelter items to the Rakhine State. The SRC will work with the Myanmar Red Cross and the Bangladesh Red Crescent to ensure that the relief items reach the affected communities.The second is the Rahmatan Lil Alamin Foundation (RLAF), a community based charity, which has raised more than S$300,000 thus far2. The RLAF will work with the UN High Commission for Refugees to distribute aid to the refugees in Bangladesh. Earlier in December 2016, RLAF and our local communities had also channelled more than S$180,000 of humanitarian aid to affected communities in the Rakhine State.Mercy Relief will also raise funds, and is planning to deploy a team to conduct aid distribution in Bangladesh. Mercy Relief will work with Action Aid International, an established international non-governmental organisation in Bangladesh, as well as the Bangladesh Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief, to distribute S$100,000 worth of items including solar lamps, blankets and shelter for affected communities.The funds raised will be used to provide humanitarian aid to all affected communities in that region, regardless of ethnicity or religion.Members have also asked about the role ASEAN can play. Mr Christopher De Souza asked specifically if Myanmar can be compelled under the relevant articles in the ASEAN Human Rights Declaration (AHRD). The AHRD reaffirms ASEAN Member States' common interest and commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as the purposes and the principles enshrined in the ASEAN Charter. Although the AHRD does not impose legal obligations, we expect all ASEAN countries to uphold the spirit and the principles set out in the document.The situation in Myanmar affects all ASEAN countries as well as the wider international community. It is in our common interest to work with the Myanmar government to support its efforts to restore peace and stability, and to find long-term solutions to this complex communal problem in the Rakhine State. While the principle of non-interference is enshrined in the ASEAN Charter, the Charter also calls for enhanced consultations on matters of common interest of ASEAN.The ASEAN Foreign Ministers recently held an informal meeting, which Minister Vivian Balakrishnan attended, in New York on 23 September 2017 to discuss the issue of the Rakhine State. The meeting began with Myanmar Minister of State for Foreign Affairs U Kyaw Tin's briefing on the developments in the Rakhine State, followed by a frank and robust exchange of views among the Foreign Ministers.Following the meeting, the Philippines issued an ASEAN Chairman's Statement on the Humanitarian Situation in the Rakhine State, which condemned the recent acts of violence and welcomed Myanmar's efforts to resolve the situation on the ground. The Chairman's Statement also reflected the undertaking by all ASEAN Member States to support Myanmar's humanitarian relief effort, and to activate the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on disaster management (AHA Centre) to work with the Myanmar Government-led mechanism, in cooperation with the Red Cross Movement, to deliver humanitarian assistance to all displaced inhabitants without discrimination. This was in line with the Foreign Ministers' recognition of the need for increased humanitarian access to all affected communities.The Myanmar government has acknowledged that they need to address this crucible of inter-communal tension in the Rakhine State. One year ago, State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi established a commission led by former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan to make long-term recommendations to address the challenges facing the ethnically and religiously divided Rakhine State. The Advisory Commission on Rakhine State has submitted its final report and recommendations. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has expressed her government's determination to implement them fully and ""within the shortest time possible"". A 15-member inter-ministerial committee has been formed to look into the recommendations. Myanmar has also welcomed the offers of the international community to contribute towards the government's humanitarian assistance programme. We hope that these efforts will be fruitful.There is an urgent need to restore peace, stability, harmony and reconciliation among all the communities in Rakhine State. As ASEAN Member States, we are all committed to abide by the principles set out in the ASEAN Charter to enhance good governance and the rule of law. ASEAN has conveyed its hope and support for a long term solution to a complex inter-communal issue with deep historical roots. While responsibility to resolve the complex issues involving the peoples of the Rakhine State ultimately rests with all the parties concerned in Myanmar themselves, Singapore and our fellow ASEAN Member States can do our part to support efforts by all parties to work towards a viable solution, so that affected communities can rebuild their lives."
maintaining ratio of six workers to support one elderly person,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Prime Minister what have been the solutions implemented to maintain the current ratio of six workers to support one elderly person given that the total fertility rate remains low and one out of four Singaporeans will be aged 65 years and above by 2030.,"Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): Singapore's resident old-age support ratio, which measures the number of residents aged between 20 and 64 to each resident aged 65 and above, is currently 5.1. As is the case in many countries with ageing populations, this ratio will likely decline over time.To sustain a healthy working population, we provide strong support to Singaporeans who have children and maintain a calibrated pace of immigration. We have also supplemented the local workforce with foreigners in Singapore on time-limited work passes. Our policies are regularly reviewed and adjusted.While the old-age support ratio uses the age threshold of 65 years, many seniors now stay active beyond the age of 65. In 2016, 43% of residents aged between 65 and 69 were in the labour force. They may also be contributing in other important ways, such as providing care to their family members.Each successive cohort of seniors will be healthier, more educated and live longer. We should enable them to contribute for as long as they are willing and able. Since 1 July this year, the re-employment age has been raised from 65 to 67. We have also extended the Additional Special Employment Credit to encourage continued employment of older workers and enhanced WorkPro grant support for employers to redesign jobs to be more age-friendly. These initiatives help older Singaporeans to contribute actively in the community and economy well into their silver years."
additional after-school care places given more hdb bto flats in yishun,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Education (Schools) in light of the increasing number of HDB BTO flats in Yishun (a) what are the plans to expand the number of places for after-school care; and (b) how will the Ministry cope with the demand for additional resources and personnel to keep pace with expansion.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: MOE is on track to open Student Care Centres (SCCs) in all primary schools by end 2020.The supply of school-based SCC places in Yishun has largely kept pace with demand. Nine out of 10 Primary Schools in Yishun have a school-based SCC, and the remaining school will see its new school-based SCC set up by 2019. The provision of after-school support in Yishun is also supplemented by community-based SCCs registered with the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF).MOE will continue to work closely with MSF to monitor the demand for SCC places both in our schools and in the community. MOE will also work with our schools on the plans to set up new school-based SCCs or expand the capacity of existing centres, at a pace that does not compromise quality."
trend of women in civil service and women in leadership positions in civil service,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Prime Minister (a) what is the breakdown in percentage terms of civil servants in each gender currently; (b) of these, what is the percentage of women holding leadership positions; and (c) what is the trend of women joining the Civil Service.","Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): As at 31 December 2016, 56% of (about 84,000) Civil Servants are female. Among officers in leadership positions (defined as officers in super-scale grades), 45% are female. Females made up 56% of the officers who joined the Civil Service over the past five years (2012-2016)."
books bought by nlb and costs incurred,"Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) over the last five years, what is the number of books purchased by NLB; (b) what is the total cost incurred; (b) what is the number of books condemned by NLB over the same period; (c) what is the total number of books currently in NLB's collection; and (d) if he can provide an update on the National Reading Movement that was launched a year ago.","Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim: Member of Parliament Miss Cheng Li Hui has asked about the status of the National Library Board’s (NLB) collection and the National Reading Movement.Let me first give an update on the National Reading Movement. The Movement was launched last year to get Singaporeans to read more, read widely and read together. It aims to reach out to adults and seniors, promote reading in mother tongue languages and galvanise the community to build a vibrant reading culture in Singapore. I am happy to report that the Movement is doing well. This year, more than 120,000 participants took part in reading-related activities in the lead-up to the National Reading Day on 29 July, which is a third more than NLB's target of 88,000 participants.The Movement includes the Read@Work programme, to promote reading in the workplace. More than 30 organisations have come on board NLB's Read@Work programme so far, and actively contribute to the Movement by publicising the National Reading Day activities and sponsoring reading events like Read for Books. NLB remains on track to reach out to their target of 50 organisations by March 2018.To encourage reading among seniors, reading corners have been set up at 17 Senior Activity Centres which serve around 4,700 members in total. Examples of Senior Activity Centres are the Thye Hua Kwan Senior Services at Taman Jurong and the Tembusu Senior Activity Corner. NLB also provides a toolkit for volunteers who conduct regular reading activities with the seniors in SACs and even rental flats. In addition, NLB is also doing more for young children. NLB has provided bulk loans to about 248 pre-schools, including many which serve children from lower income families, as identified by PCF and NTUC First Campus HQ and under ECDA's KidSTART Enhanced Support to Preschool programme.NLB has also expanded its programme offerings in Mother Tongue Languages. As a strategy to increase readership, NLB has embarked on an approach to help readers and participants of NLB’s programmes establish meaningful connections via one’s cultural background. This includes a lecture series by experts on Malay arts and culture that was started for adults. As an example, local music legend, Ramli Sarip was invited as a guest lecturer for the series. Five such sessions had been organised since the start of NRM, with at least 30 participants per session. In addition, 28 mother tongue reading clubs have been set up – 17 for children and 11 for adults. These are encouraging signs that show more are interested in, and are reading in the mother tongue languages.Besides the National Reading Movement, NLB has improved its collections, services and programmes to drive a reading culture in Singapore. Currently, NLB spends about $14 million each year to maintain a collection of over 6.6 million books. Over 800,000 new books are purchased annually for the lending and reference collections. At the same time, a similar number of books which are damaged or outdated are taken off the shelves. Many of these books which are still useable are donated to charities and community organisations for their own community libraries. Mobile reading is also on the rise since the NLB App was launched last October, which gives users access to 600,000 eBooks anytime, anywhere.NLB will continue to ensure that Singaporeans enjoy affordable access to information through our Next Generation Libraries. The two newly reopened libraries – Sengkang and Bukit Panjang Public Libraries – have seen at least a doubling of loans and visitorship compared to the similar period last year. The Tampines Regional Library, which just re-opened on 5 August 2017, saw more than 220,000 visitors in August – almost three times the number of visitors in the same month last year. NLB's digital visitorship has also risen 11% since 2016. NLB also works closely with the community, co-creating programmes with patrons and engaging volunteers to run its library programmes, for example, the Volunteers Corner in the Tampines Regional Library is run entirely by volunteers. We are very thankful for the continued support of our partners and volunteers, which is essential to NLB's success."
improving it skills of mature workers for smart nation,"Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Communications and Information in view of Singapore's push to be a Smart Nation, how is the Ministry equipping mature workers with IT skills to leverage on technology in their workplaces.","Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim: Singapore's move towards a digital economy and a Smart Nation will bring many new opportunities and good jobs for all Singaporeans. To ensure that every Singaporean will be ready to take advantage of such opportunities, we will help all workers, including our more mature workers, upskill and reskill themselves in digital and technological skills, regardless of which sector of work they are in.We have developed many programmes to assist the mature workers in the InfoComm Technology, or ICT sector, to improve the currency and relevance of their ICT skills through the TechSkills Accelerator, or TeSA in short. MCI launched TeSA last year, recognising the need for a concerted national effort to train, upskill and reskill professionals in ICT skills. Coordinated by IMDA and partners such as SSG and WSG, TeSA is a tripartite initiative between the government, industry and the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC). I am happy to update that since the launch, we have made good progress, with about 12,000 workers across the economy having benefitted from TeSA courses. Of these 12,000 workers, nearly half are mature workers 40 years old and above, though they form about one-third of our ICT workforce. This also reflects that proportionately, more mature workers have been able to benefit from Government’s training initiatives.Beyond courses, TeSA also provides a coordinated career support ecosystem for workers looking to join or develop their careers in ICT. TeSA Integrated Career Services is a collaboration between Workforce Singapore, the Singapore Computer Society (SCS), NTUC and e2i to provide, for example, group and technology mentoring sessions to help guide workers in IT trends and skills needed. To date, 350 workers have participated in these sessions, and more than half of them are mature.As we move towards a Smart Nation, other sectors beyond the ICT sector will also have to digitalise and rely more heavily on technology. We are thus collaborating with other lead agencies to help their sectors upgrade and re-skill their workers. Currently about 30 different skills frameworks are also being developed across these sectors. IMDA and SSG are working on harmonising technical competencies across these different skills frameworks to better assist workers in various sectors upgrade themselves in the necessary technological skills.For our workers who are least familiar with technology, we will help them build up foundational digital technology literacy. To this end, SSG will be launching a national programme called SkillsFuture for Digital Workplace to help individuals gain confidence in the use of data, innovation, and technology, and to engender a mindset for change, innovation and resilience. The programme aims to build foundational digital awareness and literacy and enable individuals to perform functional tasks using digital platforms. More details will be announced by SSG.Helping our workers become digital-ready is an integral part of our digital economy and Smart Nation roadmap. I will speak more about our future plans in the upcoming months."
closer monitoring of schools to minimise fights between students,Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for Education (Schools) following the recent fracas between students in a secondary school (a) whether the Ministry will consider installing CCTVs along school corridors and other areas for the staff to monitor the students' activities; (b) what is the psychological and social profile of these students; and (c) how can the Ministry minimise such incidents in schools.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: Most students are well-behaved and are able to interact well with one another. However, some may, from time to time, make mistakes in the process of growing up. Some students may act inappropriately to express their unhappiness or resolve conflicts in an aggressive way. Our schools do not tolerate physical aggression. When such incidents occur, school staff will step in to defuse and manage the situation. Schools also check on the physical and emotional well-being of the victims, discipline and counsel the aggressors, and educate the bystanders.Our schools impart social and emotional skills, such as emotional regulation and conflict management through Character and Citizenship Education (CCE). Positive values such as respect and harmony are also emphasised. Teachers use teachable moments, including the recent incident, to educate our students and reinforce the relevant skills and values. Schools also actively create a positive and supportive environment for all our students.All schools have been equipped with CCTV systems to enhance safety and security within their premises. The cameras are installed to cover critical areas in schools like gates, access routes and blind areas. This is mainly to deter crime and detect wilful intrusions.Shaping the character and behaviour of our students is an on-going process. It requires the collective effort of the school, the family and the community to educate and support our students as they learn from their mistakes and strive to become better persons."
promoting competitive cycling,"Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth in light of the cycling team's good showing at the 2017 Southeast Asian Games (a) whether the Ministry will give more support and attention to promote cycling on a competitive basis; and (b) what is the outcome of the 2014 feasibility study to evaluate the building of a velodrome in Singapore.","Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: Our Team Singapore athletes in Cycling did well at the recent SEA Games and ASEAN Para Games. For the SEA Games, we won one Gold, one Silver and one Bronze, which included our first ever medal in women's track cycling, and our first Gold medal in men's cycling in 20 years. At the APG, we won one Gold, five Silvers and eight Bronzes, which included Singapore's first ever Gold medal in APG cycling events. I would like to congratulate our Cycling athletes for flying the Singapore flag high.Sport Singapore (SportSG) works closely with the Singapore Cycling Federation (SCF) on its plans to develop Cycling in Singapore. Funding has been provided for four full-time staff and two coaches, the use of facilities, as well as overseas training and competitions. Campaign funding was also provided for additional training in preparation for the SEA Games. One of the cyclists is currently receiving the spexScholarship. SportSG also supports the sport through the Singapore Sports Institute, in the areas of sports medicine and sports science. Specialists from the Singapore Sports Institute regularly assess the progress of our Team Singapore cyclists, and helped them to prepare for the recent SEA Games.SportSG's feasibility study on the velodrome is ongoing. As the development of a velodrome involves significant investment, such a project needs to be carefully assessed relative to other sports infrastructure needs."
requirement for traditional chinese medicine shops that sell herbal teas to obtain foodshop licences,Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources what is the justification for requiring Traditional Chinese Medicine shops that sell herbal teas to obtain foodshop licences with effect from 1 October 2017.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The National Environment Agency (NEA) regularly reviews its licensing regime as part of a continual process to improve the hygiene standards of food and drinks sold in Singapore. We recognise that many Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) shops have been preparing and selling herbal tea within their premises. Such food preparation activities, if not done hygienically, can pose risks to public health, such as giving rise to food poisoning. We have therefore engaged the Singapore Chinese Druggist Association and TCM shops on the proposal to license premises with on-site preparation of herbal tea and food so as to ensure the hygienic preparation of these products, strengthen food hygiene standards and give consumers greater assurance when purchasing such products.The details of the enhancements to the food hygiene regime will be released in due course. The implementation date of the enhancements has not been decided and we will continue to engage the industry to ensure that the TCM shops have sufficient lead time to get ready."
efforts to help freelancers and workers in gig economy with medical and retirement adequacy,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Ministry can provide an update on the efforts to help freelancers and workers in the gig economy with their medical and retirement adequacy.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: Individuals working in the gig economy can be employees or self-employed persons, commonly known as freelancers.For those who are employees, they and their employers are required to make CPF contributions for their healthcare and retirement needs. The Government also helps those who are lower-income build up their CPF savings through Workfare top-ups.As for those who are self-employed, they are required to save for healthcare through mandatory Medisave Account contributions. They can also save for retirement by making cash top-ups to their Special and Retirement Accounts, and enjoy tax relief for doing so. Lower-income self-employed persons may also be eligible for Workfare top-ups from the Government.In view of the changing employment profile driven by technology and new business models, as announced at Committee of Supply 2017, MOM has formed a tripartite workgroup to study and holistically address the key issues that self-employed persons face, including saving for healthcare and retirement. The workgroup is currently studying the issues and consulting stakeholders, and will provide an update on its findings in due course."
traffic accidents on causeway in past three years,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is the number of traffic accidents on the Causeway in the past three years; (b) how many of these accidents involve jay walkers; and (c) what plans does the Ministry have to ensure road safety on the Causeway for both vehicles and pedestrians especially during peak hours.,"Mr K Shanmugam: Between 2014 and 2016, a total of eight traffic accidents on the part of the Causeway within Singapore's jurisdiction were reported. None of these accidents involved pedestrians.The part of the Causeway within Singapore's jurisdiction has been designed such that there is no need for pedestrians to cross or walk on any vehicular roads. Traffic Police works closely with the relevant agencies to ensure safe traffic flows. For example, during periods of high traffic volume, Woodlands Checkpoint has special support teams to augment the deployment on the ground.We urge pedestrians to use the footpaths and refrain from walking on the roads. Motorists should also drive safely."
"review sales, content and cost of milk products and supplements for adults","Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked the Minister for Health whether there are plans to review and assess the sales, content and costing of milk products and milk supplements for adults especially for those who are on dietary supplementation and tube feeding.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: The safety of milk products and supplements is regulated by AVA under the Singapore Food Regulations. Food manufacturers and importers must ensure that they are safe and suitable for consumption.There is a variety of adult milk products and supplements for different needs and at different price ranges available in the market today. There are no plans to regulate the sales and prices of adult milk products and supplements for now. Seniors who require such products and are in need of financial assistance can apply to the Seniors' Mobility and Enabling Fund (SMF) for means-tested subsidies to defray the costs of such products. More than 4,000 beneficiaries have received subsidies for milk products and supplements from SMF to date.We will continue to monitor the situation to support seniors who are in need."
prevalence of crytocurrency in singapore,Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked the Prime Minister (a) how prevalent is the use of cryptocurrency in Singapore; and (b) what measures will MAS introduce to regulate Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).,"Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): We are familiar with money, that is, notes and coins, as a medium of exchange – an intermediary instrument use to facilitate transactions. I make a TV, sell it for money, and then use it to buy a pair of shoes. Money becomes a medium of exchange because all of us put our trust in its reliability. The Central Bank issues these notes and coins, and makes them legal tender. Legal tender means that the medium of exchange is recognised by law to be valid for meeting a financial obligation.With advancement in technology, new virtual means of payment have emerged, such as cryptocurrency, which is a form of digital token secured by cryptography. They are not legal tender. But some people put their trust in them and use them as a means of payment. Hence, Bitcoin and Ether have been adopted by people in some communities to pay one another or to pay for goods and services.MAS has been monitoring the use of such virtual currencies. Their use is not prevalent in Singapore – about 20 Singapore retailers like restaurants and online shops currently accept Bitcoins. This is unlike places like Japan, where the use is more popular. Likewise, in the Singapore financial industry, use of virtual currencies as a mode of payment is not significant. Trading is generally for speculative investment purposes, and the volume is low compared to other countries such as US, Japan and Hong Kong.Similar to most jurisdictions, MAS does not regulate such virtual currencies per se. However we regulate the activities that surround them if those activities fall within our more general ambit as financial regulator. Let me give two examples.First, virtual currencies, due to the anonymous nature of the transactions, can be exploited for money laundering and terrorism financing risks. MAS is working on a new payment services regulatory framework that will address these risks.A second example is fund-raising. Virtual currencies can go beyond being a means of payment, and evolve into ""second generation"" tokens representing benefits such as ownership in assets, like a share or bond certificate. The sale of such ""second generation"" tokens to raise funds is commonly known as an initial coin offering or ICO (""ICO""). A number of ICOs have been structured out of Singapore in recent months.These are financial activities that falls under MAS’ regulatory ambit. Hence, on 1 August 2017, MAS clarified that if a token is structured in the form of securities, the ICO must comply with existing securities laws aimed at safeguarding investors’ interest. So the requirements of having to register a prospectus, obtain intermediary or exchange operator licences, will apply. These intermediaries must also comply with existing rules on anti-money laundering and countering terrorism financing.MAS has not issued new legislation specifically for ICOs. We will continue to monitor the developments of such offers, and consider more targeted legislation if necessary.Some consumers may be attracted to invest in virtual currencies and digital tokens due to their recent exponential rise in value. However, as a financial regulator, our focus is securitised interests in assets – such as shares in a company. MAS does not and cannot regulate all products that people put their money in thinking that they will appreciate in value. But recognising that the risks of investing in virtual currencies are significant, MAS and the Commercial Affairs Department have published an advisory alerting consumers to these risks, and are working together to raise public awareness of potential scams."
regulating transaction fees and platform rental fees charged by cashless e-payment platforms providers,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Prime Minister whether the Ministry will regulate transaction fees and platform rental fees charged by cashless e-payment platform providers by mandating caps on such fees so as to accelerate the widespread adoption of e-payment by small and medium enterprises and consumers.,"Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): Assoc Prof Goh asked if MAS will regulate transaction fees and platform rental fees charged by e-payment platform providers, so as to accelerate the adoption of e-payments.Transaction fees vary across different types of payments, whether it is cash, cheques, debit cards, credit cards, NETS, stored value cards, e-wallets or PayNow. The cost of using cash or cheques is actually relatively high, and this is in fact one of the motivations for promoting e-payment.We are in fact taking a multi-prong approach to promote e-payment. This includes• Putting in place infrastructure such as FAST to ensure an open architecture,• Ensuring the interface is convenient and easy to use,• Stipulating standards when necessary, such as the impending common QR code standard for Singapore (SGQR), so that a merchant just needs one QR code to receive all types of e-payment• Promoting adoption of e-payment amongst merchants and consumers• Keeping cost of e-payment as low as possible, which is what Assoc Prof Daniel Goh has asked about.To keep fees at a reasonable level it is important to ensure there is enough competition. Hence we have always insisted on an open architecture system so that e-payment will not be monopolised over time by one dominant player.MAS worked with the banking industry to develop PayNow. Today, it enables convenient and safe peer-to-peer transactions, and we are now working to extend PayNow to businesses as a cheaper way to make e-payments. PayNow will use the SGQR for e-payment transactions, which means there is no need for any point of sale terminals, or any rental fees involved for these equipment.NETS has recently announced plans to roll out NETS Pay, which offers a wide range of solutions for merchants to receive payments from consumers at an affordable rate. NETS Pay will add to the range of low cost e-payment solutions available in the market.The Government has also been engaging various stakeholders to raise awareness of the available e-payment solutions and hence help drive further adoption. Businesses need to be aware of the advantages of various e-payment solutions and identify a solution that would best suit their needs.As of now, our focus is to ensure these low cost options are available, and spur competition to keep cost affordable to small businesses. It will minimally be cheaper than having to handle cash. As to whether we should regulate the fees for e-payment, we are studying the experience of other jurisdictions, and will study them carefully."
government's policy stance on telemedicine and tele-consultation,"Mr Teo Ser Luck asked the Minister for Health in view of recent developments in technology application in the healthcare sector, what is the Ministry's policy and regulation with regard to (i) tele-consultation between doctors and patients and (ii) telemedicine in areas of prescription, treatment and diagnosis.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Telehealth platforms enable patients to receive care in convenient locations of their choice. Patients can receive more timely advice and intervention to manage their conditions without having to schedule an appointment to visit a healthcare institution. This reduces the caregiver burden and empowers individuals to take an active role in their health.In 2015, the Ministry of Health (MOH) issued a set of National Telemedicine Guidelines to guide healthcare providers in the safe and appropriate delivery of healthcare services through telemedicine. This is complemented by the Singapore Medical Council's (SMC) Ethical Code and Ethical Guidelines (ECEG) and accompanying Handbook on Medical Ethics issued in 2016 that set out the standards of care required of doctors practicing telemedicine.Based on the guidelines, the standard of care expected of doctors providing telemedicine should be comparable to what patients would receive in a face-to-face consultation. Doctors providing care via virtual platforms have a responsibility to ensure that the remote diagnosis made is accurate and that patients receive appropriate medical advice and management for their conditions. If in doubt, doctors should offer to see the patients face-to-face to conduct a physical assessment or refer the patient to the nearest clinic or healthcare institution.Today, telemedicine is typically offered as an extension of care for stable patients, taking place after a doctor has had an initial face-to-face consultation with the patient and is satisfied that the patient is suitable to be followed up via telemedicine. As telemedicine services continue to evolve, MOH will monitor the developments and review our policies and regulations so as to enable new care models that are beneficial for patients, while ensuring their safety and welfare at all times."
quotas for admission of students from different performance bans to reduce monopoly of elite schools,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Education (Schools) whether the Ministry will consider introducing quotas for students in the top, middle and bottom performance bands for admission into Secondary One so as to create a more inclusive environment for students and reduce the monopoly of elite schools.","Mr Ng Chee Meng: Most secondary schools already take in a full spectrum of Express, Normal (Academic) and Normal (Technical) students. This approach is appropriate and serves the students’ learning needs.We do not believe that schools need to be identical in student profiles to be inclusive. A diverse school landscape allows for variety in school types and educational provisions, to match different student needs.For instance, some Normal (Technical) students benefit from a more customised curriculum and pedagogy, as well as additional social-emotional learning support through whole-school activities. This is why we set up the specialised schools Crest and Spectra, which also have facilities customised for their unique curriculum and pedagogy.We also have Specialised Independent Schools, which cater to students with talents and strong interests in specific fields such as the arts and sports. Integrated Programme schools provide six-year programmes to cater to academically strong students who can benefit from more flexibility in pursuing broader learning experiences.What is common for all students, regardless which school they attend, is our strong emphasis on values and Character and Citizenship Education. All schools provide their students with ample opportunity to interact and make friends with peers from diverse backgrounds, for example through co-curricular activities and Values In Action learning experiences. This remains core to our education mission, as we aim to nurture our students to be good citizens, who respect others and build an inclusive community and nation."
encouraging health checks to create greater awareness for risk of diabetes,Mr Darryl David asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry will collaborate and partner with more organisations and corporations to provide for increased opportunities for health checks and tests that will raise more individuals' awareness of the risk of diabetes.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: We have been collaborating with community partners, employers and healthcare institutions to encourage Singaporeans to go for health screening. Our healthcare clusters also conduct community health screening programmes and encourage patients to go for screening when they visit polyclinics and GPs. These efforts have benefitted more than 40,000 residents in 2016.The Health Promotion Board (HPB) works with businesses and unions to conduct onsite screening for employees. One example is the ""Check Car, Check Body"" programme which offers health screening to taxi drivers while they wait for their taxis to be serviced at the service centres. To date, we have reached out to over 200,000 workers, including taxi drivers and bus captains. We welcome the participation of other corporations in these programmes to benefit even more workers. Besides workplaces, we also tap on networks of the People's Association (PA) and grassroots organisations to educate Singaporeans about the importance of going for regular health screenings.MOH will continue our partnerships with these organisations to enhance the coverage of diabetes screening. This is a key component of the War on Diabetes."
delay in upgrading north-south and east-west mrt lines,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the Government was consulted regarding the delay in upgrading the North-South and East-West MRT lines that was initially slated for 2002 as announced by SMRT's then managing director in July 1997 but was only proceeded with in 2012; and (b) why did the Government allow the said delay.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Under its original licence to operate the North-South and East-West Lines, SMRT owned the rail operating assets and was solely responsible for renewing and upgrading these assets, so long as it met LTA's regulatory requirements for system performance and reliability. Its decision on the intended timing of the replacement of the signalling system was internal and was not in breach of the terms of its licence.We have since transited SMRT's rail lines to the New Rail Financing Framework (NRFF). Under the NRFF, LTA owns the operating assets, putting it firmly in the driver's seat for asset renewals and upgrades."
communication protocol for delays on train lines,Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the usual communication protocol to the public when delays occur on train lines operated by SMRT or SBS Transit; and (b) whether there has been any instances where the operators have eschewed from making any public announcements of such delays in the last two years.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: LTA requires the rail operators to inform passengers of any delay exceeding 10 minutes during peak hours and exceeding 15 minutes during off-peak hours, without exception. This is done through announcements in stations, on-board trains, on the operator and LTA websites as well as through mainstream and social media. For delays that require longer recovery times, additional information will be provided to help commuters plan their journeys better. Over the last two years, there have been no cases where LTA has found the operator liable for failing to meet these requirements."

proportion of tenured and tenure-track university faculty members who are singaporeans,"Mr Seah Kian Peng asked the Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (a) what is the current proportion of tenured and tenure-track faculty members who are Singaporeans in NUS, NTU and SMU; and (b) what was the proportion 10 years ago.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: Ten years ago, in 2007, 46% of the tenured and tenure-track faculty members at NUS, NTU and SMU were Singaporeans. In 2017, the proportion is about 40%. SIT and SUSS do not have a tenure system but the proportion of Singaporeans among faculty is much higher in SIT and SUSS.We must ensure there is a strong core of Singaporean academics in our autonomous universities, even as they strive to recruit the best talents from Singapore or overseas based on merit to deliver world class education and conduct high quality research.To do so, our AUs actively look out for Singaporean academics who are working overseas. We launched the Singapore Teaching and Academic Research Talent Scheme in 2015 to encourage more young Singaporeans to pursue an academic career. Under this scheme, we have awarded close to 80 undergraduate and postgraduate scholarships to Singaporeans who are interested in the academia. The three AUs awarded 260 PhD scholarships from 1990 to 2014."

frequency of infringement of bus lane and bus priority box schemes,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the number of infringements for the Bus Lane and Bus Priority Box Schemes in 2016 and 2017; (b) how do the enforcement officers determine an infringement for the Bus Priority Box Scheme; and (c) what efforts has LTA taken to improve public awareness of the schemes.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: It is an offence for motorists to drive or leave a vehicle on a Bus Lane during restricted hours or not to give way to buses or stay in a Bus Priority Box. Between January and August 2017, LTA enforcement officers through the help of cameras, detected around 13,000 Bus Lane infringements and 700 Bus Priority Box infringements. This is a 30% and 70% reduction respectively as compared to the same period in 2016.Information on the schemes is regularly broadcasted on LTA Traffic News and presented on the LTA and One.Motoring websites. To further increase public awareness of the schemes, banners are also put up at affected locations to alert and remind motorists."

safe riding programme for students who cycle to school,Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for Education (Schools) (a) what is the current demand for bicycle parking in schools; (b) whether students are allowed to ride e-bikes to school; and (c) what is the take-up rate of the Safe Riding Programme in schools since its inception.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: MOE does not actively monitor the demand for bicycle parking in schools. From schools' observations, the demand is generally low. While schools do not prohibit students' use of e-bikes, students are generally advised not to bring expensive items to school. In addition, for all riders and pillion riders of e-bikes, LTA stipulates a minimum age of 16 years.Land Transport Authority's Safe Riding Programme will be launched at the end of this year. MOE will work with LTA to offer the programme to students in Secondary Schools who are able to ride a bicycle."
widening of footpaths in silver zones,"Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for Transport (a) to date, how many Silver Zones have had their adjacent footpaths widened; (b) whether the widening of footpaths along Silver Zones is part of the Silver Zone initiative; and (c) if not, when will LTA implement the widening of footpaths for all Silver Zones.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Widening of footpaths is part of the Silver Zone programme, which aims to enhance road safety for the elderly. Of the 11 completed Silver Zones, seven already have widened footpaths or dedicated cycling paths to complement existing footpaths.Going forward, new footpaths will be at least 1.8 metres wide, compared to today’s standard of 1.5 metres."
singapore's role as 2018 asean chair to address humanitarian situation in rakhine state,"Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs with Singapore assuming the ASEAN chair in 2018, whether there are plans for more concerted efforts to compel the Myanmar government to stop the discrimination and humanitarian catastrophe of the Rohingya people.","Dr Vivian Balakrishnan: In Myanmar's Northern Rakhine State, a humanitarian disaster has unfolded in the aftermath of a terrorist attack on 25 August 2017 and subsequent related acts of violence. The conflict has resulted in loss of lives, destruction of homes and the displacement of large numbers of people. The situation in the Rakhine State is a complex inter-communal issue with deep historical roots, dating back more than half a century. There are no quick-fixes. The immediate task at hand is for all the parties involved to cease actions that will further worsen the situation on the ground, so that humanitarian assistance can reach those desperately in need regardless of ethnicity and religious affiliation. We urge the restoration of peace, stability and the rule of law in the Rakhine State. It is the responsibility of every government to protect every civilian and to restore law and order. Comprehensive, long-term and sustainable solutions must also be found to address the underlying challenges and build trust among the different stakeholders and communities, and define the legal status of everyone in Rakhine State. As a close friend and neighbour, Singapore stands ready to support the Myanmar government in whatever way we can to make a positive contribution.Given the scale of the humanitarian needs, the Singapore Government will be offering bilateral humanitarian aid to both Myanmar and Bangladesh. We hope to contribute to the efforts to help all affected communities on both sides of the border regardless of ethnicity and religion. For Myanmar, we will be offering an aid package comprising approximately S$100,000 worth of supplies from the Singapore Government. For Bangladesh, given that it is experiencing a more severe refugee crisis, we will be offering two humanitarian loads comprising approximately S$200,000 worth of supplies from the Singapore Government.Our community organisations have also launched fundraising drives for the affected communities in Rakhine State. I would like to highlight three such organisations in my reply.The first is the Singapore Red Cross (SRC), which has been providing humanitarian assistance in Rakhine State since 2012. The SRC has launched a month-long public fundraising appeal and committed S$27,150 worth of relief items to be distributed in Rakhine State. This is in addition to an earlier contribution of US$50,000 in shelter items to the Rakhine State. The SRC will work with the Myanmar Red Cross and the Bangladesh Red Crescent to ensure that the relief items reach the affected communities.The second is the Rahmatan Lil Alamin Foundation (RLAF), a community based charity, which has raised more than S$300,000 thus far. The RLAF will work with the UN High Commission for Refugees to distribute aid to the refugees in Bangladesh. Earlier in December 2016, RLAF and our local communities had also channelled more than S$180,000 of humanitarian aid to affected communities in the Rakhine State.Mercy Relief will also raise funds, and is planning to deploy a team to conduct aid distribution in Bangladesh. Mercy Relief will work with Action Aid International, an established international non-governmental organisation in Bangladesh, as well as the Bangladesh Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief, to distribute S$100,000 worth of items including solar lamps, blankets and shelter for affected communities.The funds raised will be used to provide humanitarian aid to all affected communities in that region, regardless of ethnicity or religion.Members have also asked about the role ASEAN can play. Mr Christopher De Souza asked specifically if Myanmar can be compelled under the relevant articles in the ASEAN Human Rights Declaration (AHRD). The AHRD reaffirms ASEAN Member States' common interest and commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as the purposes and the principles enshrined in the ASEAN Charter. Although the AHRD does not impose legal obligations, we expect all ASEAN countries to uphold the spirit and the principles set out in the document.The situation in Myanmar affects all ASEAN countries as well as the wider international community. It is in our common interest to work with the Myanmar government to support its efforts to restore peace and stability, and to find long-term solutions to this complex communal problem in the Rakhine State. While the principle of non-interference is enshrined in the ASEAN Charter, the Charter also calls for enhanced consultations on matters of common interest of ASEAN.The ASEAN Foreign Ministers recently held an informal meeting, which Minister Vivian Balakrishnan attended, in New York on 23 September 2017 to discuss the issue of the Rakhine State. The meeting began with Myanmar Minister of State for Foreign Affairs U Kyaw Tin’s briefing on the developments in the Rakhine State, followed by a frank and robust exchange of views among the Foreign Ministers.Following the meeting, the Philippines issued an ASEAN Chairman's Statement on the Humanitarian Situation in the Rakhine State, which condemned the recent acts of violence and welcomed Myanmar’s efforts to resolve the situation on the ground. The Chairman’s Statement also reflected the undertaking by all ASEAN Member States to support Myanmar's humanitarian relief effort, and to activate the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on disaster management (AHA Centre) to work with the Myanmar Government-led mechanism, in cooperation with the Red Cross Movement, to deliver humanitarian assistance to all displaced inhabitants without discrimination. This was in line with the Foreign Ministers’ recognition of the need for increased humanitarian access to all affected communities.The Myanmar government has acknowledged that they need to address this crucible of inter-communal tension in the Rakhine State. One year ago, State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi established a commission led by former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan to make long-term recommendations to address the challenges facing the ethnically and religiously divided Rakhine State. The Advisory Commission on Rakhine State has submitted its final report and recommendations. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has expressed her government's determination to implement them fully and ""within the shortest time possible"". A 15-member inter-ministerial committee has been formed to look into the recommendations. Myanmar has also welcomed the offers of the international community to contribute towards the government’s humanitarian assistance programme. We hope that these efforts will be fruitful.There is an urgent need to restore peace, stability, harmony and reconciliation among all the communities in Rakhine State. As ASEAN Member States, we are all committed to abide by the principles set out in the ASEAN Charter to enhance good governance and the rule of law. ASEAN has conveyed its hope and support for a long term solution to a complex inter-communal issue with deep historical roots. While responsibility to resolve the complex issues involving the peoples of the Rakhine State ultimately rests with all the parties concerned in Myanmar themselves, Singapore and our fellow ASEAN Member States can do our part to support efforts by all parties to work towards a viable solution, so that affected communities can rebuild their lives."
measures to restrict distribution of food and beverage products with high glycemic index,Mr Darryl David asked the Minister for Health what measures can be taken to restrict or control food and beverage products with a high glycemic index (GI) so as to reduce the risk of diabetes among our population.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Consuming large amounts of high GI food is one of the risk factors for diabetes. Common high GI foods consumed in Singapore include refined staple grain products such as white rice and white bread, and sugar-sweetened beverages like soda.From 2007 to 2016, the Health Promotion Board's efforts to work with beverage manufacturers has resulted in a 30% reduction in the median sugar level of sugar-sweetened beverages sold in Singapore. More recently, seven leading beverage manufacturers whose products comprise 70% of Singapore's beverage market, have committed to limit the sugar content of their beverages sold in Singapore to 12% or less. This is the first time major beverage companies have made such a public commitment, as part of their move towards healthier offerings for consumers.These efforts are a good start but we are not stopping here. MOH is studying additional measures to further reduce sugar consumption in Singapore, taking reference from experiences in other countries. These include the use of warning labels and advertising restrictions on pre-packaged beverages with high sugar content.For refined staple grain products, the Ministry of Health (MOH) will invest $20 million over the next three years under the Healthier Ingredient Development Scheme (HIDS) to support food manufacturers to innovate and produce healthier ingredients such as wholegrain noodles and brown rice bee hoon which have lower GI but taste just as nice as the original versions.In addition, HPB's Healthier Dining Programme (HDP) encourages consumers to choose wholegrain, ""Low GI"" and lower-calorie meal options. As of August 2017, there are over 3,100 food and beverage stalls across 67 hawker centres and 450 coffee shops offering at least one healthier option in their menus. Our target is to increase this to 40% of stalls across all hawker centres and coffee shops by mid-2019.These are part of HPB's efforts to help Singaporeans choose healthier food options and lead healthier lives."
provision of shared common space to facilitate informal interactions,Dr Tan Wu Meng asked the Minister for National Development (a) how HDB plans for the provision of shared common spaces such as pavilions and void decks in new precincts; (b) whether common space provisions have declined over the years in terms of (i) venues per resident and (ii) area per resident; and (c) how will HDB ensure future adequate venue space for (i) informal interaction (ii) community gatherings and (iii) bereavements or funeral wakes.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB actively plans for common spaces where the community can gather in the design of HDB towns and estates. The approach has evolved over the years, along with the design of HDB blocks. Compared with older slab blocks with long corridors, newer blocks are generally taller and more compact, with fewer units per floor. While this optimises land use and provides residents with greater privacy, the trade-off is a smaller void deck space under each block.With this shift in block design, HDB has embedded a variety of purpose-built facilities and amenities in newer precincts to serve as common spaces, and create opportunities for community interaction and bonding. For example, since the 1990s, precinct pavilions have been provided in new developments to provide space for community activities. HDB has also progressively introduced other amenities in newer precincts, such as 3G playgrounds, sky parks, and gardens on rooftops of multi-storey carparks, to facilitate interactions by residents of all ages.HDB continues to explore how to maximise community interactions with the smaller void deck spaces in new developments. For example, HDB introduced Community Living Rooms in 2014, which are areas located near lift lobbies and letter boxes, specially provided with seats and tables to facilitate informal small group interactions. Where large Social Community Facilities such as childcare centres are required in precincts, HDB may integrate them in multi-storey carparks or construct them as standalone blocks. This will free up the limited void deck spaces for informal interaction.Surveys of HDB residents have shown that community spaces provided in precincts are generally sufficient, and that residents are satisfied with such facilities. Nonetheless, HDB will continue to review the precinct provisions to ensure they are sufficient and support a variety of community events, in accordance with the changing demographics and needs of each HDB estate."
private residential developments encouraged to accommodate barrier-free link-bridges,"Dr Tan Wu Meng asked the Minister for National Development what policy incentives and measures are currently in place to encourage building owners of existing and upcoming private developments to accommodate barrier-free link-bridge connectivity to adjacent HDB precincts, especially precincts with a significant elderly population.","Mr Lawrence Wong: The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) works closely with public and private stakeholders to plan and implement seamless walking networks between housing estates, major facilities, and transport nodes. This is undertaken through various initiatives.First, since July 2016, developers of large shopping malls, offices, business parks, and educational institutions are required to submit a Walking and Cycling Plan (WCP) to URA and the Land Transport Authority (LTA) as part of their development applications. Through the WCP, developers will be required to provide a mix of elevated, at-grade, and underground barrier-free linkages, so as to facilitate convenient and direct pedestrian access to neighbouring developments like HDB precincts. URA and LTA will work closely with the developers to ensure that the WCP improves residents’ accessibility to surrounding amenities and services.Second, to incentivise developers to construct barrier-free linkages, URA has excluded the floor area of linkages that fulfil minimum width requirements, and remain accessible 24/7, from the maximum permissible Gross Floor Area (GFA) allowed for developments.Third, for developments released under the Government Land Sales (GLS) programme, URA stipulates requirements for developers to provide barrier-free linkages between adjoining developments within the land sales tender conditions.Fourth, since 1990, all buildings must comply with BCA's Code on Accessibility, which specifies the minimum design and construction requirements on basic barrier-free design needs of the elderly and persons with limited mobility. For older private developments built before 1990, building owners may apply for BCA's Accessibility Fund, which provides grants of up to $300,000 for owners to upgrade their buildings with accessibility features."
treatment and confinement of mentally-ill residents who destroy neighbours' properties or display signs of violence,"Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Health with regard to the mentally ill who harass their neighbours, destroy properties and display signs of violence (a) whether their treatment and confinement at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) can be expedited; and (b) what criteria have to be met for their release from IMH.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: We have been strengthening our community mental health services to better support persons with mental health conditions in the community and enhance their access to care services. For persons who display disturbing behaviours in the community, the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) will serve as a first touchpoint to coordinate care and a link to healthcare and social service agencies. AIC can be contacted at careinmind@aic.sg for assistance and referral.In cases where a person is behaving in a manner that is dangerous to self or others, members of the public can call ‘999’ for urgent police assistance. Under section 7 of the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Act (MHCTA), persons who are at risk of harm to self and/or others, and are reported to be mentally disordered, can be brought by a police officer to the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) for mental health treatment. The person will be warded if assessed to require management in an inpatient setting.Patients will be discharged from the IMH inpatient ward when the doctors assess that their acute psychiatric condition have stabilised and improved. Longer term recuperation at home amongst supportive family will be better for the patients’ full recovery and reintegration with society.IMH monitors the patients discharged to ensure that they remain compliant with their follow up appointments and medication. IMH also works with families and community-based organisations on care coordination, case management, caregiver support and education, and other forms of social support, for the discharged patients. Overall, in supporting the patients’ recovery and reintegration, families, community and social and healthcare organisations all have a part to play."
online child protection module in pre-school teachers training programme,Ms Sun Xueling asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) whether the online child protection training module to train pre-school teachers in handling child abuse cases can be made mandatory; (b) whether such a module can be made available earlier than late 2018; and (c) whether this training can be provided as part of the NITEC training course for pre-school teachers.,"Mr Desmond Lee: Preschool teachers are equipped with basic skills and knowledge to understand and detect child abuse and neglect, during their pre-employment training at the Polytechnics, the Institute of Technical Education or the various Private Training Agencies accredited by the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA). In-service preschool teachers can also take up Continuing Professional Development courses related to the prevention and early intervention of child abuse.In addition to this, the Child Protective Service (CPS) of the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) has developed a Sector-Specific Screening Guide (SSSG) and a Child Abuse Reporting Guide (CARG) to support professionals who work with children to recognise signs and symptoms of abuse and determine the appropriate course of action. ECDA conducts training sessions for principals and educators in the early childhood sector to use these guides effectively.To make such training resources even more accessible to professionals in the education, health and social service sectors, MSF CPS is working with the Social Service Institute to develop online training modules on child protection. The online child protection training modules are currently in their early stages of development. Further testing and enhancements are required before roll-out, expected in late-2018. My Ministry will study whether the development of the training modules can be brought forward. We will also look at whether these modules can be incorporated as part of the compulsory training components for early childhood qualifications, over and above the existing training that is already being provided to help trainee preschool educators understand and detect child abuse and neglect."
adequacy of common areas to use for funeral wakes in view of ageing population and smaller void deck space,Dr Tan Wu Meng asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources given the ageing population and limited common void deck space available for funeral wakes in some newer HDB precincts (a) whether this has affected the Government's forecast for funeral parlour capacity requirements; and (b) how the Government will ensure adequate funeral parlour capacity in the years ahead.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Today, funeral wakes in Singapore are mostly held at HDB void decks and precinct pavilions. A smaller proportion of wakes are held in places of worship, private home compounds and purpose-built funeral parlours. Overall, there are sufficient wake spaces available to those who need them.The Housing and Development Board (HDB) has traditionally planned and designed new HDB precincts to ensure that they meet the needs of the community. The National Environment Agency (NEA) also works closely with other Government agencies such as the Ministry for National Development (MND), the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) and the HDB to ensure the provision of sufficient land for the development of funeral parlours.My Ministry will continue to monitor the demand for funeral spaces and ensure that there are sufficient wake spaces even as Singapore's population grows and ages."
refresher courses for drivers with demerit points,"Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether drivers who chalk up demerit points can be made to attend short lectures and undergo tests so that their skills can be refreshed, for the safety of all road users.","Mr K Shanmugam: Drivers who have accumulated demerit points can attend the Driver Improvement Points System (DIPS) Retraining Course or the Safe Driving Course.The DIPS Retraining Course is a two-day course for motorists whose licences have been suspended because they have accumulated a certain number of demerit points. These motorists are required to pass theory and practical tests at the end of the course, whereupon they can have their suspension periods shortened.The Safe Driving Course is an early intervention measure that provides corrective education to motorists, even before they become liable for suspension. Participants go through a three-and-a-half-hour classroom session and a 30-minute practical session before taking a quiz. Upon the successful completion of the course, three demerit points will be expunged from the participant’s driving record.These courses are not mandatory. They offer an opportunity for motorists to come forward to correct their driving behaviour, and refresh their driving skills. This will foster greater ownership of their driving behaviour."
affordability of daycare centres for persons with special needs,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Social and Family Development how can the Ministry ensure that the day care centres for residents with special needs will continue to remain affordable for them.,"Mr Desmond Lee: There are currently 26 Day Activity Centres (DACs) that offer day care services to adults with special needs. These are operated by Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs).While fees are set by the DACs, MSF has put in place several measures to ensure that these programmes stay affordable for those who require them.First, MSF revises the quanta of operating subsidies to the VWOs at the start of every financial year to keep pace with inflation. Second, subsidies are means-tested so that these services remain affordable to lower-income families. Third, guidelines on fee revisions are issued to the centres to prevent sharp fee hikes.Apart from fees and government subsidies, the operation of these centres are also supported by Government grants such as the Community Silver Trust, which provides dollar-for-dollar matching on donations raised by the VWOs.We will continue to monitor the fees charged by VWOs for programmes that we fund to support persons with disabilities and their families."
closer monitoring of schools to minimise fights between students,Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for Education (Schools) following the recent fracas between students in a secondary school (a) whether the Ministry will consider installing CCTVs along school corridors and other areas for the staff to monitor the students' activities; (b) what is the psychological and social profile of these students; and (c) how can the Ministry minimise such incidents in schools.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: Most students are well-behaved and are able to interact well with one another. However, some may, from time to time, make mistakes in the process of growing up. Some students may act inappropriately to express their unhappiness or resolve conflicts in an aggressive way. Our schools do not tolerate physical aggression. When such incidents occur, school staff will step in to defuse and manage the situation. Schools also check on the physical and emotional well-being of the victims, discipline and counsel the aggressors, and educate the bystanders.Our schools impart social and emotional skills, such as emotional regulation and conflict management through Character and Citizenship Education (CCE). Positive values such as respect and harmony are also emphasised. Teachers use teachable moments, including the recent incident, to educate our students and reinforce the relevant skills and values. Schools also actively create a positive and supportive environment for all our students.All schools have been equipped with CCTV systems to enhance safety and security within their premises. The cameras are installed to cover critical areas in schools like gates, access routes and blind areas. This is mainly to deter crime and detect wilful intrusions.Shaping the character and behaviour of our students is an on-going process. It requires the collective effort of the school, the family and the community to educate and support our students as they learn from their mistakes and strive to become better persons."
promoting competitive cycling,"Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth in light of the cycling team's good showing at the 2017 Southeast Asian Games (a) whether the Ministry will give more support and attention to promote cycling on a competitive basis; and (b) what is the outcome of the 2014 feasibility study to evaluate the building of a velodrome in Singapore.","Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: Our Team Singapore athletes in Cycling did well at the recent SEA Games and ASEAN Para Games. For the SEA Games, we won one Gold, one Silver and one Bronze, which included our first ever medal in women's track cycling, and our first Gold medal in men's cycling in 20 years. At the APG, we won one Gold, five Silvers and eight Bronzes, which included Singapore's first ever Gold medal in APG cycling events. I would like to congratulate our Cycling athletes for flying the Singapore flag high.Sport Singapore (SportSG) works closely with the Singapore Cycling Federation (SCF) on its plans to develop Cycling in Singapore. Funding has been provided for four full-time staff and two coaches, the use of facilities, as well as overseas training and competitions. Campaign funding was also provided for additional training in preparation for the SEA Games. One of the cyclists is currently receiving the spexScholarship. SportSG also supports the sport through the Singapore Sports Institute, in the areas of sports medicine and sports science. Specialists from the Singapore Sports Institute regularly assess the progress of our Team Singapore cyclists, and helped them to prepare for the recent SEA Games.SportSG's feasibility study on the velodrome is ongoing. As the development of a velodrome involves significant investment, such a project needs to be carefully assessed relative to other sports infrastructure needs."
requirement for traditional chinese medicine shops that sell herbal teas to obtain foodshop licences,Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources what is the justification for requiring Traditional Chinese Medicine shops that sell herbal teas to obtain foodshop licences with effect from 1 October 2017.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The National Environment Agency (NEA) regularly reviews its licensing regime as part of a continual process to improve the hygiene standards of food and drinks sold in Singapore. We recognise that many Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) shops have been preparing and selling herbal tea within their premises. Such food preparation activities, if not done hygienically, can pose risks to public health, such as giving rise to food poisoning. We have therefore engaged the Singapore Chinese Druggist Association and TCM shops on the proposal to license premises with on-site preparation of herbal tea and food so as to ensure the hygienic preparation of these products, strengthen food hygiene standards and give consumers greater assurance when purchasing such products.The details of the enhancements to the food hygiene regime will be released in due course. The implementation date of the enhancements has not been decided and we will continue to engage the industry to ensure that the TCM shops have sufficient lead time to get ready."
traffic accidents on causeway in past three years,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is the number of traffic accidents on the Causeway in the past three years; (b) how many of these accidents involve jay walkers; and (c) what plans does the Ministry have to ensure road safety on the Causeway for both vehicles and pedestrians especially during peak hours.,"Mr K Shanmugam: Between 2014 and 2016, a total of eight traffic accidents on the part of the Causeway within Singapore's jurisdiction were reported. None of these accidents involved pedestrians.The part of the Causeway within Singapore's jurisdiction has been designed such that there is no need for pedestrians to cross or walk on any vehicular roads. Traffic Police works closely with the relevant agencies to ensure safe traffic flows. For example, during periods of high traffic volume, Woodlands Checkpoint has special support teams to augment the deployment on the ground.We urge pedestrians to use the footpaths and refrain from walking on the roads. Motorists should also drive safely."
checks on hawker centres for compliance with fire safety regulations,Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) how often are hawker centres checked for fire safety compliance; (b) what is the breakdown of such fires from 2015 till July this year; (c) what are the common causes of these fires; and (d) what can be done to address fire hazards at hawker centres.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The Fire Code stipulates that hawker centres need to have hose reels and fire extinguishers, and adequate, unimpeded access to facilitate escape in the event of a fire. There are also regulations on the use of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking, and cleaning requirements for kitchen exhaust ducts.SCDF adopts a risk-based approach to conducting fire safety compliance checks. Hawker centres are generally assessed to be of lower fire risk as their open-sided design ensures that they are well ventilated, facilitating smoke venting and minimising smoke logging in the event of fire. SCDF conducts checks on hawker centres on an ad hoc basis in response to feedback from the public as well as other government agencies such as NEA. Over the past three years, SCDF conducted 13 such checks on hawker centres. This is on top of routine inspections conducted by the NEA and the Town Councils, and servicing conducted by their appointed contractors which ensure the exhaust systems and ducts are well maintained and in good working order.Common causes of hawker centre fires are the accumulation of grease within poorly-maintained kitchen exhaust ducts which ignite during the cooking process, stallholders leaving their cooking unattended, and forgetting to switch off appliances at the end of the day.There were 32 hawker centre fires from January 2015 to July 2017. There were no fatalities. Five of these cases resulted in casualties and the fires were mainly caused by overheating because of unattended cooking. This could have been prevented. SCDF has also conducted comprehensive inspections to ensure the fire safety of these affected hawker centres.A large number of hawker centre fires can be prevented. As part of its Community Emergency Preparedness Programme, SCDF partners NEA to educate stallholders on how to prevent and respond to fire emergencies. SCDF has also implemented mitigating measures to reduce the risk of fires in hawker centres. For instance, SCDF, with HDB and the Town Councils, have worked together to replace all individual LPG cylinders in hawker centres with safer centralised LPG pipeline manifold systems or Town Gas.Hawker centre owners and stallholders also have a part to play. They can prevent fires by thoroughly cleaning their kitchen exhaust ducts at least once a year, not leaving cooking unattended, and switching off all appliances when they leave for the day."
impact of new national institute of early childhood development on existing course providers,"Mr Darryl David asked the Minister for Education (Schools) how will the setting up of the new National Institute of Early Childhood Development (NIEC) affect the institutions presently conducting early childhood education programmes such as the polytechnics, ITE and SEED institute, especially in terms of (i) staffing issues (ii) enrolment and (iii) the perceived quality of the certification issued by these institutions.","Mr Ng Chee Meng: The National Institute of Early Childhood Development (NIEC) will bring together and build on the Early Childhood (EC) training capabilities and expertise of Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Temasek Polytechnic, ITE and SEED Institute. These four institutions will transfer their EC programmes, faculty and students to the new NIEC once it is set up in 2019.MOE is working with the four institutions on the transition of their EC faculty and staff to NIEC. About 60 to 70 full-time faculty with core expertise in EC are expected to transfer their employment to NIEC. There are about another 100 adjunct EC faculty currently employed by the four institutions on a contract basis. There will continue to be a role for the adjunct faculty to teach in the EC courses at NIEC. MOE and the four institutions will continue to engage the affected faculty and staff closely and see to the change management process for all.For students, all EC students enrolled in the courses to be transferred from the four institutions to NIEC will be considered NIEC students from 2019. There will be limited impact on the overall student enrolment at the polytechnics and ITE, as they continue to run many other courses. In addition, pre-Employment Training (PET) students will concurrently be identified as students of the polytechnic or ITE where their course is sited. We expect NIEC's intake to comprise more than 2,000 students in its first year, and continue to grow thereafter.NIEC will award the qualifications for students graduating in 2019 or later. For PET students, they will receive diploma and Higher Nitec certifications awarded by NIEC in collaboration with the polytechnics and ITE respectively. This recognises the role that the polytechnics and ITE continue to play in the NIEC PET students’ educational experience, for example in the common, non-EC modules that they will take alongside their ITE and polytechnic peers.We expect the NIEC-awarded EC qualifications to be well-recognised in the EC sector. EC alumni of the four institutions can be assured that their certificates will still be recognised in the sector.The formation of NIEC has been welcomed by many as a significant, positive development for the EC sector and profession. We are heartened that the institutions involved see value in coming together to support the establishment of NIEC, for the greater benefit of the sector."
impact of increase in moe kindergartens on smaller pre-school operators,Mr Darryl David asked the Minister for Education (Schools) what will be the impact on smaller independent operators in the early childhood education industry with the proposed significant increase in MOE kindergartens along with the already significant increases in early childhood and kindergarten places by the major anchor childcare operators.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: The Government's foremost objective is to ensure that parents have access to quality and affordable preschools for their children. This will provide a good start for every child and better support families with young children.To this end, the Government will be increasing the number of government-supported preschool places, which are subjected to fee caps and other quality requirements. This increase will be primarily in estates with new housing developments to meet the anticipated demand of young families.Besides the Anchor Operators and MOE Kindergartens, government-supported operators also include small- and medium-sized private child care operators that have joined the Partner Operator Scheme. We currently have 23 Partner Operators operating a total of about 200 centres, and we expect to support more centres under this scheme. We intend for the Anchor and Partner Operators, as well as MOE Kindergartens, to play a catalytic role to spur investments in quality in the sector, while providing affordable options for parents.We will also continue to provide broad-based support for the sector as a whole, to benefit all operators and early childhood educators. These include various grants such as funding for smart solutions to raise productivity, and stronger support for professional development via the Skills Framework for Early Childhood Care and Education and the National Institute for Early Childhood Development (NIEC).Overall, the market will remain open and parents will continue to have choice in selecting a suitable preschool for their children. Smaller operators, some of which offer niche programmes, can continue to cater to the different needs and preferences of parents.I encourage all operators to make use of the schemes available to invest in uplifting the quality of their centres and teachers, in tandem with the overall improvements in the preschool sector. This will help to contribute to a strong foundation for our children."
pioneer generation package coverage for traditional chinese services,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling asked the Minister for Health (a) whether there are any plans for traditional Chinese medicine services to be included under the coverage of the Pioneer Generation Package (PGP); and (b) whether Medisave incentives can be given to pioneer generation members who do not use any PGP subsidies within a calendar year as an encouragement for staying healthy.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: There are currently no plans to extend Pioneer Generation (PG) subsidies to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), which plays a complementary role in our healthcare system. PG subsidies are meant to help Pioneers with part of their healthcare costs in hospitals, polyclinics and GP clinics. MOH provides support for TCM development in various ways including funding and support for TCM capability development, continuing education and research. Charitable TCM establishments with Institution of Public Character (IPC) status also benefit from tax exemption and are eligible to receive tax deductible donations, which enable them to provide affordable TCM services in the community.Under the PG package, all Pioneers receive life-long annual Medisave top-ups of up to $800, depending on the year they were born. Pioneers who stay healthy will be able to save more of these Medisave top-ups for their future needs. More importantly, staying healthy will enable them to age well and lead an active life.To help them do so, we have several measures to encourage our Pioneers to stay healthy. For example, the Health Promotion Board encourages Pioneers to do regular physical activity through the ""You Can Get Moving"" campaign. Another measure is the enhanced Screen for Life programme. From 1 September 2017, Pioneers can receive free health screening and the first follow-up consult when they go for recommended screenings."
accountability review of government officers following lapses in controls,"Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for Finance whether there will be an accountability review of Government officers involved given the lapses in financial controls in grants administration, management of development projects, as well as IT governance as reported in the Report of the Auditor General for FY2016/17.","Mr Heng Swee Keat: Ms Foo asked about accountability review of the officers involved. The head of each of the agencies concerned, be it the Permanent Secretary of a Ministry or the Chief Executive of a Statutory Board, is responsible for investigating the cases under his agency, rectifying the lapses and taking the appropriate disciplinary actions.The lapses highlighted this year by AGO were due to individual negligence, human errors or situations where procedures were in place but not followed. There is no evidence of a systemic weakness within government agencies in terms of compliance. The officers responsible for these lapses will be held accountable and will be subject to disciplinary actions, commensurate with the officer's culpability and the severity of the mistake. The lapses will also be considered when appraising the officer's performance.As of today, of the 14 observations in the AGO report, rectification and staff actions have been completed for nine while the remaining five are in progress. They are expected to be completed, latest by October 2017. The Auditor-General has also said it will ascertain that follow-up actions are taken. As it has demonstrated in past years' reports, AGO will not hesitate to highlight situations where it finds that agencies have failed to follow up as they had indicated. Agencies are also accountable to the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) and PAC reports are publicly available."
complaints of cigarette smoke drifting into neighbouring houses,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Law in the past two years (a) how many disputes concerning cigarette smoke from neighbouring units drifting into adjacent houses have been referred to the Community Mediation Centres; and (b) of these conflicts, how many have been resolved and what have been the terms of the resolution.","Mr K Shanmugam: From January 2015 to May 2017, only 2 cases involving neighbour disputes concerning cigarette smoke were referred by the Courts to the Community Mediation Centre (CMC). In the same period, there were 45 such cases which were voluntarily registered by an aggrieved party directly at the CMC. That makes 47 cases of neighbour disputes involving cigarette smoke registered at the CMC in total. This is less than 2% of all cases registered at the CMC during the same period.As mediation is a voluntary process, mediation can be proceeded with only if both parties agree to mediate. Of the 47 cases that were registered, 8 cases proceeded to mediation. All 8 cases which proceeded to mediation were successfully resolved at the CMC.The terms of settlement included (a) the respondent agreeing to reduce the frequency of smoking, (b) the respondent agreeing to take measures to prevent cigarette smoke from drifting into neighbouring units, and (c) the respondent agreeing to be contacted directly by the complainant if smoke drifted in from the respondent's unit."
increasing test laboratories' and gps' data submission in national electronic health record,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry will consider (i) requiring all laboratories to participate in the National Electronic Health Record system to upload patients' test results and (ii) providing trained personnel to general practitioners to encourage and assist them to participate in the system.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Data contribution to the National Electronic Health Record (NEHR) is currently voluntary for all private healthcare licensees and the Ministry of Health (MOH) has been reaching out to healthcare providers to encourage participation. To enhance patient safety and continuity of care, MOH is looking to mandate under the new Healthcare Services Bill that all licensed healthcare providers, including clinical laboratories, contribute data to the NEHR.In the meantime, public consultations are ongoing. Dedicated teams have been set up and trained to engage various groups of licensees, including laboratories, hospitals and general practitioners, to better understand their concerns and needs, and provide relevant support and assistance. We are also working with IT providers supporting Clinical Laboratories, Hospitals and GPs, to enable connections with NEHR."
lessons from accidents involving young drivers of private-hire cars,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Transport what are the key lessons that LTA has learnt from the accidents involving young drivers of private hire cars.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: LTA has imposed a minimum of two years’ driving experience, rather than a minimum age, on applicants for the Private Hire Car Driver's Vocational Licence. Traffic accident data does not show that there is a higher incidence of accidents among younger drivers.LTA also rejects applicants with a poor driving record, such as conviction for drunk driving and those who have had their driving licence revoked. These conditions are reviewed regularly."
increase in accidents involving private-hire cars,Mr Ong Teng Koon asked the Minister for Transport whether accidents involving private hire drivers have increased more than proportionately to the number of private hire drivers.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: It has not. Over the last two years, the number of private hire cars has tripled. The number of accidents involving such cars has similarly increased by about three times."
convert atms to serve customers of any bank and maintaining bank accounts with low amounts of cash deposits,"Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Prime Minister whether MAS will consider converting all Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) to be usable by all major banks in Singapore and all of their customers instead of each bank building its own ATM network and customers having to search for ATMs of their banks resulting in duplication of capital, resources and customer inconvenience.","74 Mr Ang Wei Neng asked the Prime Minister how will the Ministry make it easier for residents to open and maintain bank accounts with low amounts of cash deposit.Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): According to World Bank estimates, 96% of Singapore residents above the age of 15 have bank accounts. The figure would be higher for adults. Another source of information comes from the GST Voucher Scheme. About 40,000 Singaporeans have encashed the cheques they receive under the scheme, which could be because they do not have bank accounts.To make it easy and affordable for Singaporeans to open bank accounts, major retail banks have offered Basic Banking Accounts or BBAs since 2002. While the exact features differ from bank to bank, these BBAs generally operate like normal savings accounts and offer unlimited ATM transactions, access to internet and mobile banking services.The cost of opening and maintaining a BBA is very low. An individual needs only an initial deposit of $20, sometimes even less. For instance, DBS/POSB does not require any initial deposit for the opening of its POSB Everyday Savings Account. The bank also waives the account balance fall-below service fee for children, the elderly, full-time National Servicemen and recipients of public assistance.Nonetheless, some Singaporeans remain unbanked. This may be due to low awareness of the availability of BBAs or by choice. The move towards electronic payments has necessitated a fresh look into our efforts to encourage Singaporeans to set up bank accounts. This needs to be done on a national basis, with the government working in partnership with the banks, retail merchants, and community leaders.As a start, MAS will work with banks and community leaders to run outreach programmes, through community clubs, RCs and senior citizen centres, to assist those without a bank account to open an account.There is also a significant group, mostly the elderly, who have a bank account but rely primarily on cash to perform transactions. For this group, we want to help them acquire the basic skills, as well as the confidence, to perform simple electronic transactions. IMDA has implemented the Silver Infocomm Initiative to promote IT awareness and literacy, including use of electronic transactions, among seniors aged 50 and above. To date, about 130,000 seniors have benefitted from the program. SkillsFuture Singapore will be running a national programme, called SkillsFuture@Digital Workplace, to help anyone gain confidence in the use of technology, including using mobile banking apps, signing up for PayNow, and making electronic payments. MAS will work with the industry and community leaders to further expand on these public outreach and education efforts.The purpose of encouraging electronic payments is to bring about greater convenience for everyone. Electronic payments must therefore offer clear benefits over cash for consumers and merchants. They should be simple to use, cheap, and accepted everywhere. When we achieve that, the need to go to an ATM will be far less, and this will greatly benefit the seniors. One can just go directly to his or her favourite hawker stall and pay electronically with a card, mobile phone, or even a watch.Our agencies, especially MAS, SNDGO, NEA and HDB are working together to find ways to improve the day-to-day electronic payments experience in the heartlands, taking care to ensure that solutions should consider the needs of all, from the young to the old. The agencies are also crowdsourcing ideas from the private sector, so as to co-create solutions that will make electronic payments ubiquitous at hawker centres, HDB coffee shops, and heartland shops.To be clear, while we promote electronic transactions, the Government is not targeting to phase out cash entirely. There will always be a group of Singaporeans who face practical challenges in accessing digital banking services and cash will remain important to them.MAS will continue to monitor and work with the industry to ensure that basic cash services remain accessible to those who need them.In this connection, Mr Patrick Tay asked if we should require all ATMs of banks to be inter-operable so as to make cash withdrawal points more accessible to residents.We are actually approaching this from a position of advantage. Singapore is already well-served by ATMs. Our ATM coverage is significantly higher than in other city-states such as Hong Kong. The two biggest networks in Singapore are operated by DBS/POSB and UOB/OCBC. At least 90% of HDB households can find ATMs from both networks, ie an ATM from their own bank, within 500 meters of their homes. Many working adults and students will also have access to ATMs near their places of work or study or along their daily commutes.The interoperability between the two local bank ATM networks is a further step that MAS has raised with the banks. It should yield efficiency gains in the system as a whole and allow for a redistribution of ATMs in the long term to maximize convenience to customers. However, to achieve efficiency gains, the number of ATMs may need to be scaled back in some locations, which could affect queuing times in those places.Beyond ATMs, banks have also sought to improve Singaporeans' access to cash withdrawal services in other ways. They have partnered with major retail outlets such as 7-Eleven, Sheng Siong and Giant to offer fast and easy cash withdrawals as part of consumers' shopping experience.Most fundamentally however, as I have mentioned earlier, we are working with the industry to develop widely accepted electronic payment options that are easy to use, even for the elderly. With more cashless alternatives, our reliance on cash for transactions, and the need for ubiquitous ATMs, should decline over time.Singapore, as a compact city, needs to navigate this transition well and become a city ready for the future, and a bright spark in the digital world. At the same time, we will ensure that the transition is inclusive and no one will be left behind as we journey towards being a Smart Nation."
ensuring smooth integration of new signalling system on north-south and east-west mrt lines,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether he can provide an update on the progress of the integration of the new signalling equipment for the North-South and East-West MRT Lines; (b) what is the specific timeline for the completion of the tests and checks required beyond the description of ""a few months"" indicated in LTA/SMRT's press release; and (c) what are the lessons learnt from the train disruptions that have occurred during this integration that may assist to improve service recovery measures for similar future breakdowns.","65 Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for Transport (a) what arrangements are in place to facilitate the smooth implementation of the communications-based train control (CBTC) signalling system on the North-South and East-West MRT Lines; and (b) what operational constraints, challenges and hazards have arisen from the concurrent usage of the CBTC signalling system between Pioneer and Tuas Link on the East-West Line and on the entire North-South Line with the older Westinghouse fixed-block signalling system on the remaining stations of the East-West Line.Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Installing a new signalling system is a complex exercise. For the entire North-South and East-West Lines, re-signalling will entail the installation of new equipment in more than 95 kilometres of train tracks, 141 trains, 54 stations and three train depots. This involves thousands of individual radio devices, more than 1,600 kilometres of communication and control cables, and the end-to-end rewiring of 4 different train models to accommodate the new hardware. That, however, is still the relatively easier part of the project.The more challenging part is to integrate the new signalling system to work properly with the other rail systems, whilst the North-South and East-West Lines remain operational. It is akin to implanting a new central nervous system to a living body, whilst ensuring that the other organs continue to function. The London Underground, which also undertook such a re-signalling project a few years ago, took almost a year for its new system to stabilise. They were the first to warn us of these challenges, and I had shared their painful experience in this House early in the year. This was despite them implementing more than a hundred partial line closures to facilitate installation and testing.For us, closing the North-South or East-West Line is not an option. These two lines account for more than two million rides daily. We need to continue to operate the legacy signalling system even as we install and test the new system. The Member alluded to the complexity of keeping both signalling systems operational. This is indeed the case.SMRT, LTA and system supplier Thales have therefore taken a cautious and progressive approach to installing and testing the new signalling system. I have advised them earlier to not rush this project. We started with more than 1,300 tests conducted during non-service hours, running empty trains. It was useful glitches were discovered and software patches were duly installed and re-tested. After we were satisfied with these tests, we embarked on testing under ""live"" conditions, with trains loaded with commuters. Even then, we started small, with off-peak testing during the last hour of service from March 28th, and full Sunday testing from April 16th. During full Sunday testing, we also ramped up the frequency of trains to mirror weekday conditions. New glitches were discovered and more software patches installed and re-tested.Again, only after we were fully satisfied with these second and third phases of testing did we embark on full-weekday testing from May 28th. Full-weekday testing is necessary to stress the system under typical peak hour conditions, when trains run at high frequencies with heavy commuter loads. But again, to be extra careful, we scheduled the start of testing to coincide with the June school holidays, when commuter traffic was lighter. We are now at the tail end of this phase of testing for the North-South Line.Despite our best efforts, commuters have had to endure some service delays, as forewarned by the London Underground. Nevertheless, the implementation has been smoother than what we feared. The prolonged testing and progressive stressing of the system has generally paid off. While it has not eliminated delays, it has minimised them.As for project timeline, we are currently focused on stabilising the North-South Line. We have seen promising results from the latest software installed on July 14th. We expect to complete testing for the North-South Line before December. Testing of the East-West Line will then commence, for completion next year. The software improvements and lessons learnt from the North-South Line will be carried over to the East-West Line.The new signalling system will be a significant upgrade from the legacy system used since 1987. Once stabilised, train services will be more reliable. We can increase the number of trains to be deployed on the network, leading to shorter waiting times for commuters. However, much work remains to be done. I seek the public's continued patience and support."
cases where government assistance was stopped due to money raised through online crowdfunding,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) how many cases have there been in the past three years where social assistance or medical subsidies were stopped or applications rejected because the recipients raised money through online crowdfunding; (b) whether the Ministry inquired into the reasons for the recipients turning to online crowdfunding and, if so, what were the reasons; and (c) whether online crowdfunding is threatening to disrupt the charity sector.","Mr Desmond Lee: We are aware of two cases where clients raised money through online crowdfunding, and their applications for social or healthcare assistance were turned down because the applicants' households were assessed to have sufficient resources after taking into account the donations raised. In both cases, the applicants had received government assistance before.All individuals and households applying for assistance are treated equally. Applications are assessed holistically, taking into account the financial, social and health circumstances of the household. Government assistance is available for all persons and families who are vulnerable and need help. We are not aware of the reasons why the two individuals chose to raise funds through online crowdfunding.Crowdfunding enables those who need help to actively reach out to, and seek assistance from a wider public. While we are heartened to see many Singaporeans stepping forward to help others in need, we also have some concerns with certain online crowdfunding practices.For instance, there have been cases where individuals present inaccurate information online to raise funds, including denying that they have received Government assistance. Should there be more crowdfunding cases discovered to have exploited the generosity of donors, the public may become sceptical towards worthy fund-raising initiatives. This may dampen the charitable spirit, and would run counter to our goal to nurture a gracious and compassionate society.As crowdfunding platforms enable fund-raisers to reach a much wider audience within a shorter time-span, it is not surprising that online fund-raising has been gaining traction. The benefits of technology will definitely be accompanied with certain pitfalls. With crowdfunding platforms becoming more popular, the charity sector will also need to evolve and adapt accordingly.It is paramount that the principles of transparency and accountability are adhered to in crowdfunding. The Office of the Commissioner of Charities has highlighted that fund-raisers are obliged to provide clear and accurate information to the public about the beneficiaries and the purpose of these fund-raising appeals. They should keep proper records of donations received and disbursed, and ensure that donations are used in accordance with the intent communicated to the public. In the case of online crowdfunding platforms, information should be disclosed to the public about their status as commercial entities, the proportion of donations which will be given to the intended beneficiaries, and how their fees are computed such as details of transaction charges, if any.It is encouraging to know that some online crowdfunding platforms have shown efforts to ensure that the causes for which they are fund-raising are legitimate, and taken more effort to conduct due diligence checks to help donors discern the credibility of beneficiaries as part of their duty to donors. However, not all crowdfunding platforms conduct such checks. I strongly urge all crowdfunding platforms to put in place measures to validate the legitimacy of beneficiaries and ensure that donations are used responsibly. This will certainly enhance public confidence in donors to such online fund-raising appeals.At the same time, donors also have an important role to play. Donors should remain vigilant and discerning in responding to online fund-raising appeals, so as to avoid falling victim to improper fund-raising activities. How will the donations be used? How are records of donations received and funds disbursed maintained? How are unused funds being accounted for? Will the fund-raiser be receiving any commission from my donation? These are some important questions that donors should ask. When in doubt, donors should find out more from the fund-raisers before making a donation. At no time should anyone feel pressured to give. If donors have concerns regarding any improper fund-raising activities, they should report the matter to the Office of the Commissioner of Charities. If fraud or scams are suspected, donors should file a Police report immediately."
incentives to translate government-funded research into industry applications and commercialisation,"Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) what incentive schemes have been put in place for researchers and academics tapping on the Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2020 research funding to accelerate translation of research into industry applications and commercialisation.","Mr S Iswaran: Since the launch of our first $2 billion National Technology Plan in 1991, Singapore has built up a strong base of R&D capabilities through steady and consistent investments. In 2015, Gross Expenditure on R&D (GERD) reached a new high of $9.5 billion, an increase of 11.8% from 2014. Our Research Scientists and Engineers (RSE) talent pool similarly reached a new high of 35,000 in 2015, up 6.6% from 2014.We are now making several shifts under the $19 billion Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) 2020 plan to accelerate the translation of research into industry applications and economic value. This will ensure that Singapore is well-positioned to harness our RIE investments to drive the next phase of our economic growth.First, to tighten the linkages between our R&D capabilities and industry needs, we have increased the Industry Alignment Fund (IAF) from $1.61 billion in RIE2015 to $1.75 billion in RIE2020. This fund supports our public researchers for collaborations with companies , including MNCs, large local enterprises as well as SMEs and startups, on research projects with potential economic impact. Companies provide both cash and in-kind contributions to show that they value the R&D conducted.Second, we have enhanced support for public researchers to develop their upstream intellectual property (IP) into prototypes through Gap Funds , which support smaller, early stage projects with disruptive technological potential, as well as larger projects for market validation of technology. Such translational R&D projects help to de-risk the commercialisation pathway of our public sector IP, and facilitate the adoption of such IP by industry. One indicator of the increasing uptake of public sector IP by industry, is that A*STAR issued over 1,000 licenses to companies under RIE2015, four times the number under S&T2010.Third, public agencies are developing an IP Framework to harmonise the management and utilisation of public sector IP. This will enhance the speed and certainty of the licensing process to encourage companies to license public sector IP. The framework also incentivises public researchers to actively seek out commercialisation opportunities through the sharing of financial returns with the inventors of the IP.Finally, public researchers who wish to spin off their IP into startups can access a comprehensive spectrum of support. As a first step, Innovation and Enterprise Offices (IEOs) provide public researchers with mentorship and training in business development skills, advice on IP rights, and access to platforms and networks that link them to potential investors. Public researchers who go on to establish startups can tap on Startup SG grants and equity co-investments with private sector partners, as well as co-working space, lab facilities and mentoring support from public and corporate incubators such as A*StartCentral. An example of a local startup supported by A*StartCentral is MiRXES (pronounced MER-REXUS), which develops diagnostic test kits for the early detection of gastric cancer and breast cancer. Spun out by A*STAR researchers, MiRXES successfully secured funding through A*StartCentral's investment-onboarding programme to link up startups with committed investors. MiRXES is now planning to expand its manufacturing facility in Singapore to supply overseas markets.The Government will closely monitor these initiatives to promote the commercialisation of our R&D, and make adjustments or introduce new programmes based on the outcomes achieved and feedback from industry."
checks on donees in lasting power of attorney for singles to prevent financial exploitation,"Ms K Thanaletchimi asked the Minister for Social and Family Development in respect of a Lasting Power of Attorney drawn up by singles, whether the Ministry has plans to audit and check on their donees for financial exploitation.","Mr Desmond Lee: We recognise that a fair number of our elderly are singles. They may be more vulnerable to financial exploitation should they lose capacity.It is important for each of us to choose our donee carefully, and consider what powers we intend to give, when we make a Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA). We should appoint someone reliable and competent, someone we trust to act in our best interests should we lose the capacity to make decisions. This is probably the most important safeguard a single person can take.However, it might not always be possible for singles to find a family member or someone they know and trust to be their donee. This is why the Mental Capacity Act (MCA) was amended in March 2016 to introduce the concept of professional deputies and donees. As these persons provide doneeship and deputyship services for remuneration, they will be supervised by the Public Guardian. We will audit and check on them.In addition, the MCA has existing safeguards to protect donors. Anyone who knows, suspects or believes that a person who lacks capacity is being mistreated can report this to the Office of the Public Guardian. The MCA has a 'whistle-blower' clause to protect the identity of a whistle-blower. If there is evidence that the donee has acted in a way which compromises the donor’s best interest, including exploiting the donor financially, the Public Guardian would investigate the matter. Where necessary, the Public Guardian would apply to Court for a suspension order to preserve the donor's assets and remove the rogue donee by revoking the LPA."
skillsfuture credit for employers and businesses,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) whether his Ministry will consider having a SkillsFuture credit for employers and businesses for the benefit of SMEs and start-ups in the area of continuing education and training for their employees.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: The Government has always recognised the need to give SMEs additional help in building up human capital capabilities.Hence, there are currently many training subsidies and grants available to firms. Under the ""Enhanced Training Support for SMEs"" scheme administered by SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG), SMEs receive up to 90% course fee subsidies and absentee payroll funding when they sponsor their employees for training. Firms can also tap on SSG’s training grants for in-house training programmes.SMEs can also tap on SPRING's ""Capability Development Grant in Human Capital Development"" to develop learning processes, training roadmaps and training frameworks for their employees. Firms can also benefit from the external insight and in-depth mentorship provided by the expert mentors under SPRING's ""SkillsFuture SME Mentors Programme"". These mentors will help to diagnose gaps in the company's learning and development initiatives, review and enhance existing training plans, as well as monitor and coach companies' supervisors or managers in their training delivery.For individuals, SkillsFuture Credit triggered their desire to upgrade. But unlike individuals, businesses operating in a competitive environment should always be eager to improve and raise their game. It is better to support SMEs through more targeted programmes and schemes, than to provide SMEs with a SkillsFuture Credit."
financial loss recorded in hdb's annual report,"Mr Ong Teng Koon asked the Minister for National Development whether the provision of $625 million for forseeable loss relating to properties under development, as announced in HDB's annual report for FY2017, relates to housing subsidies that are being given to Singaporeans and whether he can give the assurance that these subsidies are being allocated to those who need it the most.","Mr Lawrence Wong: The provision of $625 million for foreseeable loss for properties under development or for sale is the estimated loss that HDB expects to incur for Build-To-Order (BTO) projects awarded in the financial year ended 31 March 2017, including from housing subsidies given to new flat buyers. HDB makes a development loss on the BTO programme, as BTO flats are heavily subsidised. BTO flats are sold with a generous discount to their assessed market values, and this means that selling prices can be significantly below the cost of developing these flats.To ensure that housing subsidies are given to Singaporean families who need them most, HDB has put in place eligibility conditions, such as nationality, income ceiling and non-ownership of private residential property requirements for access to new HDB flats. In addition, HDB provides means-tested grants to eligible first-timer households through the Additional CPF Housing Grant and Special CPF Housing Grant. These subsidies are targeted at lower- to middle-income Singaporeans, with the lower-income receiving more help.We will continue to calibrate our housing subsidies progressively and judiciously, to ensure that public housing remains affordable to Singaporeans."
tightening it security management in light of lapses highlighted in auditor-general's report,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Prime Minister whether the Government will consider having the Cyber Security Agency to lead a whole-of-government exercise to review and tighten IT security management and monitoring in light of the Auditor-General's findings on lapses in IT security at several agencies, especially those handling sensitive personal and financial information.","Mr Lee Hsien Loong: The Cyber Security Agency oversees national cybersecurity strategy, operations, and ecosystem development. CSA works closely with regulators across eleven sectors to protect Critical Information Infrastructure from cyber threats. Among the eleven sectors, GovTech oversees the Government sector.In its report released on 18 July 2017, the Auditor-General's Office observed weaknesses in IT controls in four agencies. As far as we are aware, these lapses did not lead to any compromise of data or cybersecurity breach. The agencies will follow up with corrective action.To safeguard our systems and the data within, we regularly update and strengthen our IT policies.We conduct regular internal audits across the public service to identify shortcomings for remediation. Going forward, we will increase the number of audits, especially for the more critical and sensitive systems."
review lease period of flexi scheme for flats,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for National Development whether HDB will review the 2-room Flexi Scheme to allow the lease period to cover the elderly citizens and their spouses up to the age of 85 years old instead of the current 95 years old.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Under the 2-room Flexi Scheme, elderly flat buyers aged 55 and above can choose a lease period of between 15 and 45 years, in 5-year increments, as long as the lease can cover them and their spouse up to the age of at least 95 years. This requirement helps to address concerns about these elderly flat owners out-living their flat leases, and gives them better assurance that the flat can last them for the rest of their life.There are currently no plans to reduce this requirement to age 85 years. Households who have alternative housing arrangements and no longer need their short-lease 2-room Flexi flat can return the flat to HDB, and receive a refund of the value of the unused portion of the lease."
changes in benefits for parking labels for the disabled,"Mr Alex Yam asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) how will the Ministry ensure that those holding Class 1 Car Park Labels for Persons with Physical Disabilities but who are not using ""bulky"" mobility aids, yet with a genuine need for the use of accessible car park lots, will not be disadvantaged by the revisions to the scheme which will take effect in November 2017; (b) how does the Ministry intend to reduce abuses of the scheme; and (c) whether the Ministry will undertake a comprehensive review of the availability and provision of accessible car park lots with the Ministry of National Development.","25 Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar asked the Minister for Social and Family Development whether the Ministry will review the eligibility criteria to grant car park labels for persons with disabilities so as to include not just wheelchair-bound drivers but also other drivers who need some form of physical support such as walking aids.26 Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what is the rationale behind the recent policy changes on parking label benefits for the disabled; (b) what are the top three concerns raised by those affected by the changes; and (c) what are the Ministry's responses to the concerns raised.27 Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what percentage of disabled persons who no longer qualify under the new Class 1 car park label has purchased cars under LTA's Disabled Persons Scheme; and (b) over past five years, how many drivers with Class 2 car park labels have been summoned for using handicap car park lots when not ferrying a person with disabilities.Mr Desmond Lee: The Car Park Label Scheme (CPLS) was introduced in 1980 to assist drivers with physical disabilities in boarding and alighting from their vehicles. The CPLS was extended in 1996 to include caregivers who drive passengers with physical disabilities. Drivers with the CPLS label can park in dedicated car park lots that are marked in blue with the accessible symbol of a person in wheelchair.There are two types of labels(i) The Class 1 label is for drivers with physical disabilities; and(ii) The Class 2 label is for passengers with physical disabilities.The Class 1 label allows drivers with disability to park in accessible parking lots for as long as they need, with no time limit. The Class 2 label allows the caregiver-drivers to park in a designated lot for up to an hour, to assist their passenger with disability to board or alight. Thereafter, the vehicle must be shifted to a standard parking lot to free up the accessible lot to other eligible users.Demand for accessible lots has been rising, and this increase will further accelerate with our ageing population. The number of new label holders has increased by almost 40% from 2012 to 2016, from 1,273 to 1,758.To meet the needs of people with disability, Government agencies have been working on a range of measures. Let me highlight a few(i) First, we endeavour to provide adequate accessible parking lots.• The provision of such lots is mandated under the 2013 Code on Accessibility. The code also requires the provision of accessible and sheltered drop-off points, with direct access to every block at residential estates.• There are currently about 6,000 accessible lots across public car parks managed by HDB, URA and NParks.• Beyond what is provided for under the Code, the Housing and Development Board (HDB) and Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) have been putting in more accessible lots in areas where there is high demand, wherever this is feasible.• The Building and Construction Authority (BCA) is currently reviewing the Code, as part of its ongoing review on accessibility. This includes studying the availability and provision of accessible lots.• Given our physical constraints, however, there will be a limit to how many more accessible lots we can have.(ii) Second, agencies have moved to curb abuse and the indiscriminate use of accessible lots.• This begins with education. The National Council of Social Service conducts ongoing public education and outreach, to increase awareness about the appropriate use of accessible lots.• Beyond education, stiffer penalties have been put in place since December 2015, to deter people who park indiscriminately in parking lots meant for people with disability.• The composition fine for first-time offenders was increased from $50 to $200, and the penalty for repeat offenders was increased to up to $400.• Miss Cheryl Chan asked about the number of persons who have been penalised for indiscriminate use of the lots.- Last year, enforcement agencies issued 2,200 summonses for misuse of accessible lots in public car parks.- We do not have a breakdown on the number of summons issued to Class 2 label holders, and the number issued to drivers without labels parking in the accessible lots.- We are working closely with agencies to strengthen enforcement.(iii) Third, we have put in schemes and programmes to make public and private transport more accessible to persons with disabilities.• One example is the Public Transport Concession card that was introduced in 2014 to help defray the cost of transport for persons with disabilities.• Another example is barrier-free access and the provision of lifts and ramps at MRT stations and selected Pedestrian Overhead Bridges.• As of August this year, the Taxi Subsidy Scheme was enhanced to cover up to 80% of the cost of travel in taxis including private hire cars for work, school and in addition training; up from 50% support previously.(iv) Fourth, we come to the revisions that we will make to the Car Park Label Scheme (CPLS), from 1 November 2017.• MSF and MND had consulted existing Class 1 and 2 label holders as well as Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs), such as Handicapped Welfare Association, Disabled Persons Association and SPD as part of the review of the CPLS.• The objective was to see how we could ensure that persons with disabilities, who require the use of accessible lots for boarding and alighting, can be better assured that these lots will be available when they need them.• Beyond measures that I had outlined earlier regarding education, enforcement, and making more accessible lots available, there was general agreement that we should reserve accessible lots for persons with disabilities who require the additional space to board and alight from their vehicles and are therefore more in need of such lots.Hence, under the new eligibility criteria, car park labels will be issued to those who are medically certified as having physical disabilities and who require additional space to embark and disembark from their vehicles. These would include people using bulky mobility aids – such as wheelchairs, walking frames, and lower-limb prostheses. In addition, those with medical conditions such as muscular dystrophy, poliomyelitis and cerebral palsy will be considered based on their conditions and needs. I would like to assure Members that MSF and SG Enable will exercise flexibility when applying the new eligibility criteria and look at the physical needs and condition of each applicant, even if they do not fully meet the default eligibility criteria.Miss Cheryl Chan asked about the proportion of persons who will not qualify for the Class 1 labels, and who had bought cars under the Disabled Persons Scheme (DPS). The DPS is a financial scheme that supports persons with disabilities who are unable to use public transport and need to drive to work. Under the DPS, eligible drivers with disabilities are exempted from paying premiums for the certificates of entitlement (COE) and the additional registration fee (ARF) when they purchase a vehicle. There are around 165 persons in the DPS (81%) who also hold Class 1 labels. Not all DPS beneficiaries apply for CPLS as they may not require the additional space afforded by these accessible lots, for boarding and alighting from their vehicles. The two schemes therefore serve slightly different needs Individuals on DPS do not by default also need a CPLS Class 1 label. That said, any CPLS renewal will take into consideration the applicant's current condition and mobility needs."
checks on hawker centres for compliance with fire safety regulations,Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) how often are hawker centres checked for fire safety compliance; (b) what is the breakdown of such fires from 2015 till July this year; (c) what are the common causes of these fires; and (d) what can be done to address fire hazards at hawker centres.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The Fire Code stipulates that hawker centres need to have hose reels and fire extinguishers, and adequate, unimpeded access to facilitate escape in the event of a fire. There are also regulations on the use of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking, and cleaning requirements for kitchen exhaust ducts.SCDF adopts a risk-based approach to conducting fire safety compliance checks. Hawker centres are generally assessed to be of lower fire risk as their open-sided design ensures that they are well ventilated, facilitating smoke venting and minimising smoke logging in the event of fire. SCDF conducts checks on hawker centres on an ad hoc basis in response to feedback from the public as well as other government agencies such as NEA. Over the past three years, SCDF conducted 13 such checks on hawker centres. This is on top of routine inspections conducted by the NEA and the Town Councils, and servicing conducted by their appointed contractors which ensure the exhaust systems and ducts are well maintained and in good working order.Common causes of hawker centre fires are the accumulation of grease within poorly-maintained kitchen exhaust ducts which ignite during the cooking process, stallholders leaving their cooking unattended, and forgetting to switch off appliances at the end of the day.There were 32 hawker centre fires from January 2015 to July 2017. There were no fatalities. Five of these cases resulted in casualties and the fires were mainly caused by overheating because of unattended cooking. This could have been prevented. SCDF has also conducted comprehensive inspections to ensure the fire safety of these affected hawker centres.A large number of hawker centre fires can be prevented. As part of its Community Emergency Preparedness Programme, SCDF partners NEA to educate stallholders on how to prevent and respond to fire emergencies. SCDF has also implemented mitigating measures to reduce the risk of fires in hawker centres. For instance, SCDF, with HDB and the Town Councils, have worked together to replace all individual LPG cylinders in hawker centres with safer centralised LPG pipeline manifold systems or Town Gas.Hawker centre owners and stallholders also have a part to play. They can prevent fires by thoroughly cleaning their kitchen exhaust ducts at least once a year, not leaving cooking unattended, and switching off all appliances when they leave for the day."
impact of new national institute of early childhood development on existing course providers,"Mr Darryl David asked the Minister for Education (Schools) how will the setting up of the new National Institute of Early Childhood Development (NIEC) affect the institutions presently conducting early childhood education programmes such as the polytechnics, ITE and SEED institute, especially in terms of (i) staffing issues (ii) enrolment and (iii) the perceived quality of the certification issued by these institutions.","Mr Ng Chee Meng: The National Institute of Early Childhood Development (NIEC) will bring together and build on the Early Childhood (EC) training capabilities and expertise of Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Temasek Polytechnic, ITE and SEED Institute. These four institutions will transfer their EC programmes, faculty and students to the new NIEC once it is set up in 2019.MOE is working with the four institutions on the transition of their EC faculty and staff to NIEC. About 60 to 70 full-time faculty with core expertise in EC are expected to transfer their employment to NIEC. There are about another 100 adjunct EC faculty currently employed by the four institutions on a contract basis. There will continue to be a role for the adjunct faculty to teach in the EC courses at NIEC. MOE and the four institutions will continue to engage the affected faculty and staff closely and see to the change management process for all.For students, all EC students enrolled in the courses to be transferred from the four institutions to NIEC will be considered NIEC students from 2019. There will be limited impact on the overall student enrolment at the polytechnics and ITE, as they continue to run many other courses. In addition, pre-Employment Training (PET) students will concurrently be identified as students of the polytechnic or ITE where their course is sited. We expect NIEC's intake to comprise more than 2,000 students in its first year, and continue to grow thereafter.NIEC will award the qualifications for students graduating in 2019 or later. For PET students, they will receive diploma and Higher Nitec certifications awarded by NIEC in collaboration with the polytechnics and ITE respectively. This recognises the role that the polytechnics and ITE continue to play in the NIEC PET students’ educational experience, for example in the common, non-EC modules that they will take alongside their ITE and polytechnic peers.We expect the NIEC-awarded EC qualifications to be well-recognised in the EC sector. EC alumni of the four institutions can be assured that their certificates will still be recognised in the sector.The formation of NIEC has been welcomed by many as a significant, positive development for the EC sector and profession. We are heartened that the institutions involved see value in coming together to support the establishment of NIEC, for the greater benefit of the sector."
impact of increase in moe kindergartens on smaller pre-school operators,Mr Darryl David asked the Minister for Education (Schools) what will be the impact on smaller independent operators in the early childhood education industry with the proposed significant increase in MOE kindergartens along with the already significant increases in early childhood and kindergarten places by the major anchor childcare operators.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: The Government's foremost objective is to ensure that parents have access to quality and affordable preschools for their children. This will provide a good start for every child and better support families with young children.To this end, the Government will be increasing the number of government-supported preschool places, which are subjected to fee caps and other quality requirements. This increase will be primarily in estates with new housing developments to meet the anticipated demand of young families.Besides the Anchor Operators and MOE Kindergartens, government-supported operators also include small- and medium-sized private child care operators that have joined the Partner Operator Scheme. We currently have 23 Partner Operators operating a total of about 200 centres, and we expect to support more centres under this scheme. We intend for the Anchor and Partner Operators, as well as MOE Kindergartens, to play a catalytic role to spur investments in quality in the sector, while providing affordable options for parents.We will also continue to provide broad-based support for the sector as a whole, to benefit all operators and early childhood educators. These include various grants such as funding for smart solutions to raise productivity, and stronger support for professional development via the Skills Framework for Early Childhood Care and Education and the National Institute for Early Childhood Development (NIEC).Overall, the market will remain open and parents will continue to have choice in selecting a suitable preschool for their children. Smaller operators, some of which offer niche programmes, can continue to cater to the different needs and preferences of parents.I encourage all operators to make use of the schemes available to invest in uplifting the quality of their centres and teachers, in tandem with the overall improvements in the preschool sector. This will help to contribute to a strong foundation for our children."
accountability review of government officers following lapses in controls,"Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for Finance whether there will be an accountability review of Government officers involved given the lapses in financial controls in grants administration, management of development projects, as well as IT governance as reported in the Report of the Auditor General for FY2016/17.","Mr Heng Swee Keat: Ms Foo asked about accountability review of the officers involved. The head of each of the agencies concerned, be it the Permanent Secretary of a Ministry or the Chief Executive of a Statutory Board, is responsible for investigating the cases under his agency, rectifying the lapses and taking the appropriate disciplinary actions.The lapses highlighted this year by AGO were due to individual negligence, human errors or situations where procedures were in place but not followed. There is no evidence of a systemic weakness within government agencies in terms of compliance. The officers responsible for these lapses will be held accountable and will be subject to disciplinary actions, commensurate with the officer's culpability and the severity of the mistake. The lapses will also be considered when appraising the officer's performance.As of today, of the 14 observations in the AGO report, rectification and staff actions have been completed for nine while the remaining five are in progress. They are expected to be completed, latest by October 2017. The Auditor-General has also said it will ascertain that follow-up actions are taken. As it has demonstrated in past years' reports, AGO will not hesitate to highlight situations where it finds that agencies have failed to follow up as they had indicated. Agencies are also accountable to the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) and PAC reports are publicly available."
advice on potential risks of artificial sweeteners,"Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked the Minister for Health in view of the growing body of research about the downsides and potential risks of artificial sweeteners, whether the Ministry will be updating its advisories to vulnerable groups, patients and in their public education communications.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: There is consensus amongst international health authorities and medical professionals that artificial sweeteners can be used as part of a balanced diet to help a gradual shift away from high sugar food and beverages. Currently, no jurisdiction has banned artificial sweeteners. The US Food and Drug Administration and the European Food Safety Authority have allowed the use of artificial sweeteners for human consumption.However, the sale of artificially sweetened food and beverages is not allowed in schools in Singapore as we want to prevent children from developing a habit of consuming sweet-tasting food and drinks. This complements our healthy meals programme in schools which promotes the drinking of plain water.We will continue our efforts to raise public awareness and foster a supportive environment for consumers to make healthier food and beverage choices, and to keep Singaporeans healthy and active."
lessons from accidents involving young drivers of private-hire cars,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Transport what are the key lessons that LTA has learnt from the accidents involving young drivers of private hire cars.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: LTA has imposed a minimum of two years’ driving experience, rather than a minimum age, on applicants for the Private Hire Car Driver's Vocational Licence. Traffic accident data does not show that there is a higher incidence of accidents among younger drivers.LTA also rejects applicants with a poor driving record, such as conviction for drunk driving and those who have had their driving licence revoked. These conditions are reviewed regularly."
increase in accidents involving private-hire cars,Mr Ong Teng Koon asked the Minister for Transport whether accidents involving private hire drivers have increased more than proportionately to the number of private hire drivers.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: It has not. Over the last two years, the number of private hire cars has tripled. The number of accidents involving such cars has similarly increased by about three times."
review of airline industry to assess need for structural changes,Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the Government will set up a committee to examine whether there should be structural changes in our airline industry; and (b) how many airline employees have lost their jobs between 2016 and 2017.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Our airline industry is growing steadily. Since 2015, the airline workforce has grown by more than 5% to nearly 17,000 workers today. Company staff attrition rates have not been unusual. In 2016 and the first six months of 2017, for example, while Singapore-based airlines saw about 2,600 employees leaving their employment, a larger number, about 3,400, joined the airlines.The airline industry is of course, not immune to disruptions brought about by technology, foreign competition and innovative business models. The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore and the Changi Airport Group, for example, work closely with the airlines to develop new routes and increase traffic to and from Singapore. Importantly, airlines have to regularly evaluate their value proposition in order to stay relevant and competitive. Management and unions are alive to the competition and understand the need for continuous restructuring and embracing automation to raise productivity and meet rising consumer demand. There are several platforms for the Government and the airlines to discuss these changes and jointly formulate our response strategies, such as our industry engagement session by the Connectivity Subcommittee in 2016 to inform the works of the Committee on the Future Economy (CFE). In line with the CFE recommendations, we have launched the Air Transport Industry Transformation Map in April this year, to grow value-add per worker, improve the quality of jobs, and raise productivity. This will further support our airlines' efforts to stay ahead of the competition."
prioritise installation of solar panels in mature hdb estates with more senior citizens,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development whether HDB can prioritise the installation of solar panels in mature HDB estates with a higher population of senior citizens so as to provide additional lighting along common corridors at the doorsteps of these elderly residents at a lower cost to the town councils.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB piloted the installation of solar photovoltaic (PV) panels on the rooftops of HDB blocks in 2009. Since then, such panels have been installed on about 1,000 blocks, with another 1,500 in progress. Solar PV installation is now carried out under the SolarNova programme, which was introduced in 2015 to accelerate the deployment of solar PV in Singapore.Town Councils with blocks feasible for solar PV installation are being progressively scheduled to participate in SolarNova tenders. The feasibility of solar panel installation is determined by factors such as the location of each block and its corresponding solar irradiance potential, as well as the availability of roof space. The pace of SolarNova tenders, as well as the grouping of blocks, is based on the solar PV industry's installation capacity and logistical considerations – installations are generally grouped geographically to reduce overall implementation cost.Besides the supply of energy using solar PV, energy savings can be achieved through managing the energy demand, for example through the use of energy efficient lighting while ensuring adequate lighting levels. For instance, HDB has been working with TCs to carry out the replacement of existing light fittings to LED, to reduce the energy consumption for common area lighting."
lack of fire-rated entrance door at some hdb flats,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether the lack of a fire-rated entrance door affects the design of a HDB flat as a fire compartment; and (b) whether there are additional fire safety measures in place for HDB blocks where the majority of flats do not have fire-rated entrance doors.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB blocks comply with the prevailing fire safety standards when they are built. Fire-rated entrance doors are provided where required under the Fire Code, such as for units where the entrance doors are within three meters of the lift lobby or staircase. This is to ensure that the lift lobbies and staircases are well protected so that all residents in the block can evacuate safely in the event of a fire. There are some unit types that do not require fire-rated doors under the Fire Code, such as those opening into external corridors. This notwithstanding, every residential unit is designed as a fire compartment, with concrete walls and floors that help to prevent the spread of fire beyond or into the unit.Apart from designing all flats as fire compartments, HDB blocks incorporate other fire safety features. Staircases and lift lobbies of HDB blocks have good cross-ventilation for quick smoke dispersal. There are also exit staircases at a reasonable distance from each unit entrance to provide a safe means of escape from the building in the event of a fire. To facilitate fire-fighting, fire extinguishers, fire hose reels, dry or wet rising mains, fire engine access roads/access ways, fire-fighting lobbies and firemen lifts are also provided to HDB blocks where required by the Fire Code."
pre-registration indication of interest in primary schools,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Education (Schools) whether the Ministry will consider collating indications of interest in preferred primary schools from parents for their children a couple of years before Primary 1 registration to better plan for future intakes of each primary school and allocation of resources to the school.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: In planning the enrolment of schools, the Ministry of Education regularly reviews the demand and supply trends at the national and regional level, to ensure that there are sufficient vacancies for all eligible Primary One students. Our school planning takes into account the current and projected population and planned housing development programmes.It would not be meaningful to collate indications of interest from parents before the Primary One Registration Exercise. This is because parents’ choices can change over time, and we should allow for this to happen. It would also not be tenable for intakes of schools to be planned based on parents' choices, as schools should be appropriately sized to enable them to mount a range of activities for the benefit of all students, and to be run efficiently.What is most important to MOE is that every student receives a good quality, holistic education. Therefore, we have been resourcing all our schools with well-trained teachers, high-quality education facilities and rigorous school programmes and will continue to do so."
take-up rate for safe riding programme,"Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for Transport (a) what has been the take-up rate for the Safe Riding Programme (SRP) since its launch; and (b) what other measures, publicity, and education programmes that the Ministry is planning for to ensure safe riding on roads and footpaths in a proposed ""car-lite"" city.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The Safe Riding Programme (SRP), which was originally scheduled for launch in July, has been delayed till the end of this year. More time was required to refine the tender requirements after consultation with various stakeholders.In the meantime, we are fostering a culture of safe and responsible riding in three ways. First, LTA is raising awareness and adoption of the new active mobility rules through a nation-wide communications campaign and engagements with stakeholders such as PMD retailers and interest groups.Second, the Government has stepped up enforcement against unsafe riding. Since January this year, LTA has issued more than 1,400 advisories for unsafe riding. LTA also plans to pilot the deployment of CCTV cameras at hotspots to deter errant behaviour.Third, we have garnered more than 800 volunteers under the Active Mobility Patrol Scheme, to conduct regular patrols in their communities and to share safe riding practices with residents."
impact of bus contracting model on service improvements and performance metrics of public buses,Mr Ong Teng Koon asked the Minister for Transport whether the introduction of the new bus contracting model has led to improvements in service delivery and performance metrics on Singapore’s bus network.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: As part of the transition to the bus contracting model, we had further raised service standards. The maximum headway during peak hours is reduced from 20 minutes to 15 minutes, with feeder bus services reduced by up to two minutes to between six to eight minutes. In addition, operators are incentivised and penalised on the regularity or timeliness of bus arrivals for all the services. This has resulted in a 25% reduction in average additional waiting time for 290 bus services. Commuters have benefitted from more frequent and timelier bus arrivals, and less crowded buses.We have also seen the four bus companies enhancing their working conditions, human resource practices and employment terms to compete for bus captains. In fact, about 600 more Singaporeans have been attracted to the industry since the first package was implemented. A happier work force will ultimately lead to better service delivery."
parking of shared bicycles should not obstruct public spaces,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry will require bicycle sharing operators to have a viable proposal for their customers to park rented bicycles adequately and without obstructing public spaces before they can be allowed to operate their business.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Bicycle sharing operators (BSOs) are responsible for ensuring that their bicycles are not indiscriminately parked. If a shared bicycle is reported to be outside of a public bicycle parking lot, they have to remove it within half a day or face a penalty of $300 for the first offence and $500 per bicycle for subsequent offences. On top of this, LTA will impound the bicycle and levy a fee on the BSO for each bicycle impounded.In addition, LTA, NParks and Town Councils are working with BSOs on a Memorandum of Understanding to lay out guidelines on the responsible operation of bicycle-sharing services in public spaces."
proposal to ban vehicles from turning right simultaneously as pedestrians cross road junctions,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry will consider (i) banning vehicles turning right simultaneously as pedestrians cross the roads at junctions and (ii) programming junction signals such that vehicles will only be signalled to turn after the red-man signal has turned on.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: When the green-man signal is on, turning vehicles must always give way to pedestrians crossing the road. To disallow vehicles from turning when the green-man signal is on but there are no pedestrians crossing may hamper traffic flow unnecessarily.Nevertheless, to further enhance pedestrians’ safety, LTA has adjusted traffic light timings to give pedestrians a head start in crossing the road, and installed lighted road studs and additional road markings and signs at higher risk junctions to remind motorists to give way."
safety sensors for buses,"Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Transport what measures will be implemented to improve the safety of buses and whether the Ministry will consider requiring all buses to be equipped with features such as motion cameras, speed and obstacle sensor alarms and telematics systems to alert drivers to the risk of accidents and deter dangerous driving.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Today, all public buses are already equipped with cameras and speed limiters. The newer buses have enhanced safety features. Around 40% of the fleet has telematics and around 15% has anti-collision warning systems. Over time, these will be standard features in all public buses. LTA is also exploring more advanced safety features, such as blind spot warning systems."
schemes to encourage entrepreneurship and innovation amongst young working adults,"Mr Darryl David asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) what schemes are in place to encourage more entrepreneurship and innovation, specifically among young working adults.","Mr S Iswaran: Singapore’s startup ecosystem has seen significant progress over the past decade. The total number of startups doubled from 22,000 in 2003 to 43,000 in 2016. In particular, the number of technology startups has increased from 2,800 to 4,300 over the same period. Entrepreneurship is also increasingly recognised as a viable pathway alongside many other career options. A global entrepreneur survey conducted in 2016 found that 74% of the Singapore-based respondents aged 18 to 30 years old intended to either start their own business or become self-employed in the next 10 years.Young working adults and other budding entrepreneurs keen to start their own businesses can tap on a wide range of available support schemes under SPRING's Startup SG framework. The framework consolidates the Government’s startup programmes for budding entrepreneurs to easily identify the schemes most relevant to their needs to help them develop and scale their ideas.Under the Startup SG framework, first-time entrepreneurs can tap on the Startup SG Founder scheme which provides funding support by matching $3 for every $1 raised by the entrepreneur, up to $30,000. The scheme matches successful applicants with mentors who provide guidance and connections to business networks, in order to help the startups accelerate their growth.Entrepreneurs embarking on technology startups can tap on the Startup SG Tech grant, which supports the commercialisation of proprietary technology solutions. Startup SG Equity catalyses additional funding from the private sector by co-investing in startups with third-party investors. More information on the schemes and their areas of support can be found on the Startup SG website.In addition to the Startup SG schemes, the private sector has stepped up to play a role. For example, the Action Community for Entrepreneurship (ACE) organises networking sessions, workshops, and professional services clinics to help budding entrepreneurs and startups. ACE further facilitates peer mentoring and support by bringing together entrepreneurs of similar profiles to share their experiences and learn from one another through its Peer Group programme.Singaporeans aged 25 and above who are keen on becoming entrepreneurs can also tap on their SkillsFuture Credit to undertake eligible courses on entrepreneurship and innovation. These courses can be found on the SkillsFuture course directory."
pioneer generation package coverage for traditional chinese services,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling asked the Minister for Health (a) whether there are any plans for traditional Chinese medicine services to be included under the coverage of the Pioneer Generation Package (PGP); and (b) whether Medisave incentives can be given to pioneer generation members who do not use any PGP subsidies within a calendar year as an encouragement for staying healthy.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: There are currently no plans to extend Pioneer Generation (PG) subsidies to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), which plays a complementary role in our healthcare system. PG subsidies are meant to help Pioneers with part of their healthcare costs in hospitals, polyclinics and GP clinics. MOH provides support for TCM development in various ways including funding and support for TCM capability development, continuing education and research. Charitable TCM establishments with Institution of Public Character (IPC) status also benefit from tax exemption and are eligible to receive tax deductible donations, which enable them to provide affordable TCM services in the community.Under the PG package, all Pioneers receive life-long annual Medisave top-ups of up to $800, depending on the year they were born. Pioneers who stay healthy will be able to save more of these Medisave top-ups for their future needs. More importantly, staying healthy will enable them to age well and lead an active life.To help them do so, we have several measures to encourage our Pioneers to stay healthy. For example, the Health Promotion Board encourages Pioneers to do regular physical activity through the ""You Can Get Moving"" campaign. Another measure is the enhanced Screen for Life programme. From 1 September 2017, Pioneers can receive free health screening and the first follow-up consult when they go for recommended screenings."
monitoring skillsfuture courses undertaken by people of different age segments,"Mr Chong Kee Hiong asked the Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) with regard to the SkillsFuture programme (a) whether the Ministry monitors the general categories of courses taken by the different age segments and, if so, what is the breakdown; (b) whether there are regular checks of how courses are marketed; and (c) how does the Government ensure that course providers do not enrol students who lack basic qualifying criteria such as language competency, education background or work experience to benefit from the courses.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: The SkillsFuture Credit was launched in January 2016 to empower Singaporeans to take charge of their training and learning journeys. More than 126,000 Singaporeans used their credits in 2016.Information and Communications Technology (ICT) courses were the most popular courses for all age groups. Younger Singaporeans enrolled for courses on emerging ICT skills such as data analytics, while older Singaporeans learnt more fundamental ICT skills such as using the basic functions of a computer. Other popular areas of training include Productivity and Innovation, and Security and Investigation.SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) conducts routine checks to ensure that courses are marketed in line with guidelines.The SkillsFuture Credit course directory includes information on minimum requirements for course registration, where relevant. Nonetheless, while some training providers may set basic qualifying criteria for their courses, we do not require that they do so for all courses, as this may limit Singaporeans’ access to training which they might otherwise find useful."
"proposal for rehabilitation programme for inmates to plan, prepare and serve meals to public","Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether a rehabilitation programme can be implemented for inmates to plan, prepare, cook, and serve meals to the public whereby they can (i) learn ethics, teamwork, culinary and service skills (ii) experience career progression and (iii) earn a food handler certification, valuable trade experience and monetary savings upon their release.","Mr K Shanmugam: The Singapore Prison Service (SPS) partners the Singapore Corporation of Rehabilitative Enterprises (SCORE) to provide work and vocational training programmes in prison as part of the overall inmate rehabilitation programme. These work programmes help to keep the inmates meaningfully occupied during their prison term and enhance their work ethic, skills as well as employability upon their release. The work programmes also enable inmates to receive an allowance which is saved in their prison account and can be sent home to their families or withdrawn upon their release.Food preparation work and training programmes are available in prison. Suitable inmates are emplaced on work and training programmes at the kitchen facilities in prison. Besides preparing food for prison meals, the inmates are trained to prepare meals for external corporate and private functions. The Dining Behind Bars programme also provides opportunities for inmates to prepare and serve meals to invited guests in prison.The culinary skills training provided within prison is aligned with the Workforce Singapore (WSG) Workforce Skills Qualification (WSQ) framework. The training programmes also simulate the actual work environment to better prepare inmates to readily apply their skills to their future workplaces. Inmates are able to acquire WSQ certifications, which will help them secure better jobs upon their release.An example of such training is the Hope Cafe/Training Kitchen located in Changi Prisons. The Hope Cafe is a kitchen jointly set up by WSG, SPS and SCORE to provide inmates with the opportunities to obtain WSQ Certificates in Culinary Arts and Food & Beverage Operations. Close to 200 inmates are trained at the Hope Cafe every year.To support their reintegration, SCORE also assist these trained inmates to find related work in the Food & Beverage industry. This allows inmates to apply the training to their jobs after release."
parents' sick leave entitlement for childcare,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Prime Minister whether the Ministry will consider allowing parents to use their paid sick leave entitlement to care for their sick children or allowing this at least for parents of premature, multiple births or babies with congenital illness.","Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): The Government is strongly committed to supporting Singaporeans in their aspirations to get married and have children. We empathise with parents who face challenges in looking after children who require more care, and will look into ways to better support them.Mr Ng has suggested allowing parents to tap on their own paid sick leave entitlement to care for their sick children. Paid sick leave allows an employee to access medical care and recuperate, while protecting his employment status and income during the period of illness. If sick leave is used to also care for children, parents might be caught in difficult situations when they themselves fall ill and have insufficient sick leave to recuperate.In addition, from the employers' perspective, allowing one leave type to be used for another purpose amounts to increasing overall leave utilisation for selected employees. Therefore, apart from the impact on manpower and operational costs for employers, we should be mindful of the possible impact of such a proposal on the employability of employees with caregiving responsibilities.Although the number of parents with preterm and multiple births or babies with congenital illnesses remains small, we will seriously consider how we can better support such parents with greater caregiving needs, in addition to existing parental leave provisions which have also been progressively enhanced. I made the same point in my reply to Mr Ng's Adjournment Motion last month on extending parental leave for parents with preterm babies and multiple births."
number of amputations due to workplace accidents,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the number of amputation cases due to workplace accidents in the past three years; (b) what are the main causes for such cases; and (c) what are the measures taken by the Ministry to reduce the number of such cases.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: In the past three years, there were 389 amputation cases due to workplace accidents, comprising 129 cases in 2014, 117 in 2015, and 143 in 2016. In the first half of 2017, there were 57 cases. More than 70% of these cases involved the use of industrial machines and tools.There are three main causes for such accidents. Firstly, the lack of machine guards or safety design in machines. Secondly, employers' failure to put in place adequate safe work procedure. Thirdly, individuals' failure to follow procedures due to ignorance or disregard for safety.To improve the situation, MOM has adopted a more targeted enforcement operation on machinery safety at workplaces with industrial machines. The inspections will check on machine guards and safety design, as well as companies’ procedures for safe machine operation, in addition to other common safety breaches.MOM, the Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Council and the WSH Institute have also stepped up engagement efforts. We organize solutioning sessions and seminars on preventing amputations with our tripartite partners, The Council will also produce and disseminate videos on safe machinery. This adds to the suite of materials, including guidelines, case studies, safety cards, and safety posters, that are already available on the WSH Council website."
curb illegal gambling in hdb estates,Ms Tin Pei Ling asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is the Ministry's position on illegal gambling in HDB estates; (b) what observations and actions have the authorities made and taken so far; and (c) what further actions will they take to resolve long-standing illegal gambling issues in HDB estates when the authorities' actions do not generate lasting positive outcomes.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The Police adopt a tough enforcement stance against illegal gambling, whether it takes place in HDB estates or other places.The illegal gambling situation in Singapore is stable and under control. This is due to our strict laws on gambling. Gambling is prohibited unless specifically allowed by way of an exemption, a licence or a permit. It is an offence to gamble in a public place under the Common Gaming Houses Act and also the Betting Act. Offenders are liable to be fined up to $5,000, or imprisoned up to six months, or both.The Police are aware that some residents do gather at the common areas of their HDB estate to engage in gambling activities, and this may create social disamenities to others. When complaints are lodged, the Police will take enforcement action.However, enforcement alone is not sufficient. To achieve sustainable outcomes, enforcement must be complemented by public education and community partnership. To this end, the Police work closely with grassroots leaders and partners such as the National Crime Prevention Council, to raise public awareness of the consequences of illegal gambling."
strengthen current e-learning portal for schools,"Mr Seah Kian Peng asked the Minister for Education (Schools) what steps will the Ministry take to improve the robustness of the Marshall Cavendish (MC) Online e-learning portal for schools, given the recent severe outage experienced by students.","58 Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Education (Schools) what measures are being taken to strengthen online learning portals being used in schools against the prospect of outages that may disrupt the learning schedules of students.Mr Ng Chee Meng: Vendors of e-learning portal are required to meet the Service Level and performance requirements stipulated by MOE for schools. Load tests were conducted with these e-learning portals to ensure that they meet the performance requirements.During the recent incident involving MC Online portal, the system was still operational but users had experienced intermittent slowdown in access speed and login issues. The root cause was found to be due to a limitation in the network equipment that had caused the bandwidth to be capped instead of being scalable when network traffic became heavier. As a result, additional network traffic beyond a certain threshold was dropped and would not reach the MC Online system.To better support future home-based learning for the students, MOE has taken measures to upgrade existing network equipment. MOE will continue to work with vendors of e-learning portal to ensure that the bandwidth is scalable to meet the service requirements and that bandwidth testing is conducted prior to major activities with anticipated peak loads."
number of slip and fall workplace accidents in kitchens and food preparation areas,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the number of cases of slip and fall workplace accidents that happened in kitchens and food preparation areas in the past two years; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider including a workplace safety and health module as part of the food hygiene course for food operators and kitchen assistants.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: In 2015 and 2016, there were 96 and 92 cases of slips, trips and falls accidents in kitchens and food preparation areas. One of them resulted in a fatality while workers in the remaining cases sustained minor injuries. These cases represent approximately 3% of all the slips, trips, and falls cases due to workplace accidents in Singapore.The Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Council is working with the National Environment Agency (NEA) and SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) to include a topic on kitchen safety in the revised WSQ Basic Food Hygiene Course and Food Hygiene Officer Course by the end of this year.The additional topic would include case studies on the common safety and health hazards encountered in kitchens.In addition, educational materials, such as guidelines, safety posters, and an Activity-Based-Checklist for slips, trips and falls, are available on the WSH Council website to help companies put in place safety measures to reduce slips, trips, and falls in kitchen and food preparation areas. The Council and tripartite partners will continue to work closely together to promote awareness of good safety practices in kitchen and food preparation areas."
minimise mrt train delays due to signalling faults,Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether all delays on the MRT train system attributed to signalling faults are thoroughly investigated so as to prevent future recurrence; (b) whether LTA is satisfied with the response of public transport operators whenever there are train delays or disruption to train services; and (c) whether LTA requires public transport operators to compensate commuters affected by the train delay or disruption.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: All delays – not just those arising from the new signalling system – are thoroughly investigated, and immediate steps taken to prevent a recurrence.Following any major delay, LTA and the rail operators will activate their incident management plans which include deploying additional staff to affected stations, broadcasting of travel alerts to commuters and the provision of alternative transport options. LTA closely monitors how our public transport operators respond to each incident, to learn the lessons so as to improve the incident management process.As for compensation, LTA requires the operator to refund the fares of commuters who are forced to exit the train network as they are unable to complete their journeys because of service disruptions. Operators are also required to provide them with free public and bridging bus services."
tackling food fraud in global supply chain,"Mr Chong Kee Hiong asked the Minister for National Development (a) what measures does the Ministry have to counter the increasingly challenging problem of food fraud in the global supply chains; and (b) whether the Ministry can provide an update on the equipment, facilities and manpower investments and training to detect food fraud.","Mr Lawrence Wong: The Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) has a comprehensive regulatory regime to ensure that the food we eat in Singapore is safe. This includes measures to protect our food supply from fraudulent practices such as substitution, adulteration, counterfeiting, and misrepresentation.First, AVA ensures that food in Singapore comes from approved sources. All imported food products must comply with AVA’s food safety legislation and requirements. These requirements also apply to food produced in Singapore.Second, before food products enter the market, AVA regularly tests samples to ensure that the food is safe and authentic. This includes species identification and adulteration tests. Food products that fail these tests will not be allowed for sale.As a pre-emptive measure, AVA scans for food-related news internationally to anticipate possible food-related fraud. AVA also investigates all allegations of food fraud in Singapore. Affected products will be removed from sale, and AVA will take enforcement action against any entity that intentionally adulterates food or misleads customers. Offenders may be fined up to $10,000 and/ or imprisoned for up to three months. In addition, the implicated product will be destroyed and the licence may be suspended depending on the investigation.Significant resources are allocated to keeping our food supply safe, with more than 270 officers involved in this work. In terms of training, officers regularly attend conferences and workshops to keep abreast of developments in food technologies and testing methodologies. AVA's laboratories are also fitted with advanced equipment. For example, AVA uses the Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer to detect whether honey has been adulterated by sugar. It also uses a DNA Thermocycler to differentiate meat types."
review of airline industry to assess need for structural changes,Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the Government will set up a committee to examine whether there should be structural changes in our airline industry; and (b) how many airline employees have lost their jobs between 2016 and 2017.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Our airline industry is growing steadily. Since 2015, the airline workforce has grown by more than 5% to nearly 17,000 workers today. Company staff attrition rates have not been unusual. In 2016 and the first six months of 2017, for example, while Singapore-based airlines saw about 2,600 employees leaving their employment, a larger number, about 3,400, joined the airlines.The airline industry is of course, not immune to disruptions brought about by technology, foreign competition and innovative business models. The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore and the Changi Airport Group, for example, work closely with the airlines to develop new routes and increase traffic to and from Singapore. Importantly, airlines have to regularly evaluate their value proposition in order to stay relevant and competitive. Management and unions are alive to the competition and understand the need for continuous restructuring and embracing automation to raise productivity and meet rising consumer demand. There are several platforms for the Government and the airlines to discuss these changes and jointly formulate our response strategies, such as our industry engagement session by the Connectivity Subcommittee in 2016 to inform the works of the Committee on the Future Economy (CFE). In line with the CFE recommendations, we have launched the Air Transport Industry Transformation Map in April this year, to grow value-add per worker, improve the quality of jobs, and raise productivity. This will further support our airlines' efforts to stay ahead of the competition."
lack of fire-rated entrance door at some hdb flats,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether the lack of a fire-rated entrance door affects the design of a HDB flat as a fire compartment; and (b) whether there are additional fire safety measures in place for HDB blocks where the majority of flats do not have fire-rated entrance doors.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB blocks comply with the prevailing fire safety standards when they are built. Fire-rated entrance doors are provided where required under the Fire Code, such as for units where the entrance doors are within three meters of the lift lobby or staircase. This is to ensure that the lift lobbies and staircases are well protected so that all residents in the block can evacuate safely in the event of a fire. There are some unit types that do not require fire-rated doors under the Fire Code, such as those opening into external corridors. This notwithstanding, every residential unit is designed as a fire compartment, with concrete walls and floors that help to prevent the spread of fire beyond or into the unit.Apart from designing all flats as fire compartments, HDB blocks incorporate other fire safety features. Staircases and lift lobbies of HDB blocks have good cross-ventilation for quick smoke dispersal. There are also exit staircases at a reasonable distance from each unit entrance to provide a safe means of escape from the building in the event of a fire. To facilitate fire-fighting, fire extinguishers, fire hose reels, dry or wet rising mains, fire engine access roads/access ways, fire-fighting lobbies and firemen lifts are also provided to HDB blocks where required by the Fire Code."
pre-registration indication of interest in primary schools,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Education (Schools) whether the Ministry will consider collating indications of interest in preferred primary schools from parents for their children a couple of years before Primary 1 registration to better plan for future intakes of each primary school and allocation of resources to the school.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: In planning the enrolment of schools, the Ministry of Education regularly reviews the demand and supply trends at the national and regional level, to ensure that there are sufficient vacancies for all eligible Primary One students. Our school planning takes into account the current and projected population and planned housing development programmes.It would not be meaningful to collate indications of interest from parents before the Primary One Registration Exercise. This is because parents’ choices can change over time, and we should allow for this to happen. It would also not be tenable for intakes of schools to be planned based on parents' choices, as schools should be appropriately sized to enable them to mount a range of activities for the benefit of all students, and to be run efficiently.What is most important to MOE is that every student receives a good quality, holistic education. Therefore, we have been resourcing all our schools with well-trained teachers, high-quality education facilities and rigorous school programmes and will continue to do so."
take-up rate for safe riding programme,"Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for Transport (a) what has been the take-up rate for the Safe Riding Programme (SRP) since its launch; and (b) what other measures, publicity, and education programmes that the Ministry is planning for to ensure safe riding on roads and footpaths in a proposed ""car-lite"" city.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The Safe Riding Programme (SRP), which was originally scheduled for launch in July, has been delayed till the end of this year. More time was required to refine the tender requirements after consultation with various stakeholders.In the meantime, we are fostering a culture of safe and responsible riding in three ways. First, LTA is raising awareness and adoption of the new active mobility rules through a nation-wide communications campaign and engagements with stakeholders such as PMD retailers and interest groups.Second, the Government has stepped up enforcement against unsafe riding. Since January this year, LTA has issued more than 1,400 advisories for unsafe riding. LTA also plans to pilot the deployment of CCTV cameras at hotspots to deter errant behaviour.Third, we have garnered more than 800 volunteers under the Active Mobility Patrol Scheme, to conduct regular patrols in their communities and to share safe riding practices with residents."
proposal to ban debarking of dogs,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry will consider banning the practice of debarking dogs.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: AVA does not encourage the practice of debarking. It should be performed only as an absolute last resort. The Code of Ethics for Veterinarians, which was co-developed by AVA and the Singapore Veterinary Association, requires veterinarians to advise their clients of non-surgical alternatives and to ensure that all reasonable efforts have been made to manage the barking problem prior to performing the surgery. Failure to do so can result in written warnings, composition fines, or even suspension or revocation of veterinary licences.That said, there are some dog owners who are unable to resolve the barking problem despite having tried all other measures. For example, their dogs may be suffering from Canine Cognitive Dysfunction whose symptoms include compulsive behaviours like prolonged barking for no apparent reason. In such cases, debarking could well be the only option left to allow owners to keep their dogs, instead of having to give them up. That would be a worse outcome for both the animal and the responsible owner."
impact of bus contracting model on service improvements and performance metrics of public buses,Mr Ong Teng Koon asked the Minister for Transport whether the introduction of the new bus contracting model has led to improvements in service delivery and performance metrics on Singapore’s bus network.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: As part of the transition to the bus contracting model, we had further raised service standards. The maximum headway during peak hours is reduced from 20 minutes to 15 minutes, with feeder bus services reduced by up to two minutes to between six to eight minutes. In addition, operators are incentivised and penalised on the regularity or timeliness of bus arrivals for all the services. This has resulted in a 25% reduction in average additional waiting time for 290 bus services. Commuters have benefitted from more frequent and timelier bus arrivals, and less crowded buses.We have also seen the four bus companies enhancing their working conditions, human resource practices and employment terms to compete for bus captains. In fact, about 600 more Singaporeans have been attracted to the industry since the first package was implemented. A happier work force will ultimately lead to better service delivery."
parking of shared bicycles should not obstruct public spaces,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry will require bicycle sharing operators to have a viable proposal for their customers to park rented bicycles adequately and without obstructing public spaces before they can be allowed to operate their business.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Bicycle sharing operators (BSOs) are responsible for ensuring that their bicycles are not indiscriminately parked. If a shared bicycle is reported to be outside of a public bicycle parking lot, they have to remove it within half a day or face a penalty of $300 for the first offence and $500 per bicycle for subsequent offences. On top of this, LTA will impound the bicycle and levy a fee on the BSO for each bicycle impounded.In addition, LTA, NParks and Town Councils are working with BSOs on a Memorandum of Understanding to lay out guidelines on the responsible operation of bicycle-sharing services in public spaces."
extension of school-cleaning contract signed in 2014,Mr Zainal Sapari asked Minister for Education (Schools) (a) whether the Ministry has extended its school-cleaning contract that was signed in 2014; and (b) what is the rationale and intent of extending the contract.,Mr Ng Chee Meng: MOE has awarded the new cleaning contracts for schools which will commence on 1 October 2017. The existing contracts were earlier extended for a few months as more time was required to evaluate the tenders received.
changes in benefits for parking labels for the disabled,"Mr Alex Yam asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) how will the Ministry ensure that those holding Class 1 Car Park Labels for Persons with Physical Disabilities but who are not using ""bulky"" mobility aids, yet with a genuine need for the use of accessible car park lots, will not be disadvantaged by the revisions to the scheme which will take effect in November 2017; (b) how does the Ministry intend to reduce abuses of the scheme; and (c) whether the Ministry will undertake a comprehensive review of the availability and provision of accessible car park lots with the Ministry of National Development.","25 Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar asked the Minister for Social and Family Development whether the Ministry will review the eligibility criteria to grant car park labels for persons with disabilities so as to include not just wheelchair-bound drivers but also other drivers who need some form of physical support such as walking aids.26 Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what is the rationale behind the recent policy changes on parking label benefits for the disabled; (b) what are the top three concerns raised by those affected by the changes; and (c) what are the Ministry's responses to the concerns raised.27 Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what percentage of disabled persons who no longer qualify under the new Class 1 car park label has purchased cars under LTA's Disabled Persons Scheme; and (b) over past five years, how many drivers with Class 2 car park labels have been summoned for using handicap car park lots when not ferrying a person with disabilities.Mr Desmond Lee: The Car Park Label Scheme (CPLS) was introduced in 1980 to assist drivers with physical disabilities in boarding and alighting from their vehicles. The CPLS was extended in 1996 to include caregivers who drive passengers with physical disabilities. Drivers with the CPLS label can park in dedicated car park lots that are marked in blue with the accessible symbol of a person in wheelchair.There are two types of labels(i) The Class 1 label is for drivers with physical disabilities; and(ii) The Class 2 label is for passengers with physical disabilities.The Class 1 label allows drivers with disability to park in accessible parking lots for as long as they need, with no time limit. The Class 2 label allows the caregiver-drivers to park in a designated lot for up to an hour, to assist their passenger with disability to board or alight. Thereafter, the vehicle must be shifted to a standard parking lot to free up the accessible lot to other eligible users.Demand for accessible lots has been rising, and this increase will further accelerate with our ageing population. The number of new label holders has increased by almost 40% from 2012 to 2016, from 1,273 to 1,758.To meet the needs of people with disability, Government agencies have been working on a range of measures. Let me highlight a few(i) First, we endeavour to provide adequate accessible parking lots.• The provision of such lots is mandated under the 2013 Code on Accessibility. The code also requires the provision of accessible and sheltered drop-off points, with direct access to every block at residential estates.• There are currently about 6,000 accessible lots across public car parks managed by HDB, URA and NParks.• Beyond what is provided for under the Code, the Housing and Development Board (HDB) and Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) have been putting in more accessible lots in areas where there is high demand, wherever this is feasible.• The Building and Construction Authority (BCA) is currently reviewing the Code, as part of its ongoing review on accessibility. This includes studying the availability and provision of accessible lots.• Given our physical constraints, however, there will be a limit to how many more accessible lots we can have.(ii) Second, agencies have moved to curb abuse and the indiscriminate use of accessible lots.• This begins with education. The National Council of Social Service conducts ongoing public education and outreach, to increase awareness about the appropriate use of accessible lots.• Beyond education, stiffer penalties have been put in place since December 2015, to deter people who park indiscriminately in parking lots meant for people with disability.• The composition fine for first-time offenders was increased from $50 to $200, and the penalty for repeat offenders was increased to up to $400.• Miss Cheryl Chan asked about the number of persons who have been penalised for indiscriminate use of the lots.- Last year, enforcement agencies issued 2,200 summonses for misuse of accessible lots in public car parks.- We do not have a breakdown on the number of summons issued to Class 2 label holders, and the number issued to drivers without labels parking in the accessible lots.- We are working closely with agencies to strengthen enforcement.(iii) Third, we have put in schemes and programmes to make public and private transport more accessible to persons with disabilities.• One example is the Public Transport Concession card that was introduced in 2014 to help defray the cost of transport for persons with disabilities.• Another example is barrier-free access and the provision of lifts and ramps at MRT stations and selected Pedestrian Overhead Bridges.• As of August this year, the Taxi Subsidy Scheme was enhanced to cover up to 80% of the cost of travel in taxis including private hire cars for work, school and in addition training; up from 50% support previously.(iv) Fourth, we come to the revisions that we will make to the Car Park Label Scheme (CPLS), from 1 November 2017.• MSF and MND had consulted existing Class 1 and 2 label holders as well as Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs), such as Handicapped Welfare Association, Disabled Persons Association and SPD as part of the review of the CPLS.• The objective was to see how we could ensure that persons with disabilities, who require the use of accessible lots for boarding and alighting, can be better assured that these lots will be available when they need them.• Beyond measures that I had outlined earlier regarding education, enforcement, and making more accessible lots available, there was general agreement that we should reserve accessible lots for persons with disabilities who require the additional space to board and alight from their vehicles and are therefore more in need of such lots.Hence, under the new eligibility criteria, car park labels will be issued to those who are medically certified as having physical disabilities and who require additional space to embark and disembark from their vehicles. These would include people using bulky mobility aids – such as wheelchairs, walking frames, and lower-limb prostheses. In addition, those with medical conditions such as muscular dystrophy, poliomyelitis and cerebral palsy will be considered based on their conditions and needs. I would like to assure Members that MSF and SG Enable will exercise flexibility when applying the new eligibility criteria and look at the physical needs and condition of each applicant, even if they do not fully meet the default eligibility criteria.Miss Cheryl Chan asked about the proportion of persons who will not qualify for the Class 1 labels, and who had bought cars under the Disabled Persons Scheme (DPS). The DPS is a financial scheme that supports persons with disabilities who are unable to use public transport and need to drive to work. Under the DPS, eligible drivers with disabilities are exempted from paying premiums for the certificates of entitlement (COE) and the additional registration fee (ARF) when they purchase a vehicle. There are around 165 persons in the DPS (81%) who also hold Class 1 labels. Not all DPS beneficiaries apply for CPLS as they may not require the additional space afforded by these accessible lots, for boarding and alighting from their vehicles. The two schemes therefore serve slightly different needs Individuals on DPS do not by default also need a CPLS Class 1 label. That said, any CPLS renewal will take into consideration the applicant's current condition and mobility needs."
advice on potential risks of artificial sweeteners,"Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked the Minister for Health in view of the growing body of research about the downsides and potential risks of artificial sweeteners, whether the Ministry will be updating its advisories to vulnerable groups, patients and in their public education communications.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: There is consensus amongst international health authorities and medical professionals that artificial sweeteners can be used as part of a balanced diet to help a gradual shift away from high sugar food and beverages. Currently, no jurisdiction has banned artificial sweeteners. The US Food and Drug Administration and the European Food Safety Authority have allowed the use of artificial sweeteners for human consumption.However, the sale of artificially sweetened food and beverages is not allowed in schools in Singapore as we want to prevent children from developing a habit of consuming sweet-tasting food and drinks. This complements our healthy meals programme in schools which promotes the drinking of plain water.We will continue our efforts to raise public awareness and foster a supportive environment for consumers to make healthier food and beverage choices, and to keep Singaporeans healthy and active."
rejection of private hire car driver's vocational licence applications,"Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Transport for those whose applications for a Private Hire Car Driver's Vocational Licence have been rejected, whether LTA can reassess their applications to make a more compassionate assessment without compromising the safety and security of commuters.","24 Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Transport (a) in the last three years, how many Taxi Driver's Vocational Licences and Bus Driver's Vocational Licences have been granted to applicants who have history of court convictions respectively; and (b) whether LTA will consider granting Private Hire Car Driver's Vocational Licence to applicants with such history of convictions but with proven good track records thereafter.25 Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for Transport (a) how many Private Hire Car Driver's Vocational Licences have been issued up to end-July 2017; (b) how many applications have been rejected; and (c) of the rejected applications, how many have been issued following an appeal.26 Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for Transport what are the reasons for refusing to issue vocational driving licences for taxi drivers and private hire car drivers because the drivers have adverse records which are not related to public safety.Mr Khaw Boon Wan: LTA has received about 47,000 Private Hire Car Driver's Vocational Licence (PDVL) applications, and about 1,600 have been rejected. Applicants are rejected either because they have failed background checks, do not meet the driving experience requirement, or have poor driving records.LTA considers the nature of the offence when assessing applications from ex-offenders for a PDVL. Those who have committed extremely serious offences, such as rape, murder or kidnapping, are barred from obtaining a PDVL for life. Applicants who have committed less serious offences, like theft and cheating, will be barred for a few years from the date of conviction. Other offences which do not pose any threat to commuters, such as forgery, do not attract any debarment.LTA also considers appeals from rejected applicants to see if we can make an exception on a case-by-case basis. Out of 35 appeals considered so far, nine have been accepted. This is similar to how we assess applications for the Taxi Driver's and Bus Driver's Vocational Licences. In the last three years, LTA has granted about 1,500 Taxi Driver's and Bus Driver's Vocational Licences to applicants who have criminal records.This calibrated approach is necessary to strike a balance between giving ex-offenders an opportunity to re-integrate into society while ensuring the safety of passengers."
"withdrawal of nac funding to author of ""state of emergency""","Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) why did the National Arts Council (NAC) withdraw its funding to the author of the book ""State of Emergency""; (b) whether the author has failed to comply with any deliverables and, if so, what are the deliverables; and (c) whether the book has failed to comply with any of NAC's requirements and, if so, what is the non-compliance.","Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: The author received funding under the Creation Grant Scheme in 2010, which supports the incubation of new works.As with all National Arts Council (NAC) Creation grants, artists and arts groups sign an agreement with NAC upon successful application. This agreement sets out the terms and conditions for the grant. Based on these agreed terms, NAC then disburses this grant in stages. In certain cases, NAC may only be able to partially support projects. For instance, when the artist is unable to meet project milestones that include mutually agreed deliverables and timelines; or when the artist is unable to secure copyright and other clearances; or when the work is assessed not to meet NAC's funding requirements.In this case, the project did not meet the funding requirements mutually agreed upon as the content in the book deviated from the original proposal. Members may want to note that the book has been published in Singapore, and is in circulation in bookstores.Beyond grants for specific projects, NAC's support to artists includes facilitating arts housing, professional development, market and audience development, and arts philanthropy. NAC may support an artist or arts group in other areas, even if it is unable to support a specific project."
infestation of mayflies in nee soon south,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what are the reasons for the infestation of mayflies at certain blocks of flats in Nee Soon South; (b) how can NEA help to put a stop to it; and (c) how long will the eradication measures take to produce tangible results.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Mayflies are a type of small flying insects that are found in freshwater streams, rivers and reservoirs. They are not vectors that is they neither bite nor transmit diseases. In fact, mayflies are universally recognised as indicators of good water quality. They are also key for a balanced ecosystem as they are food for a variety of animals who live in our reservoirs. Mayfly larvae can only live in clean and clear water and they emerge from the water when they are adults to mate for a very short period of time. While mayflies can be found in all our reservoirs, they have been particularly abundant in Lower Seletar Reservoir.PUB receives a handful of feedback through the year (December-March and July-September) on the emergence of mayflies around the HDB blocks in Nee Soon South near Lower Seletar Reservoir. Their emergence is seasonal and lasts for a short period of time, about one to two weeks, as each adult can only live for a few days. While mayflies may be an occasional nuisance, they are harmless insects that occur naturally in areas around our reservoirs.PUB has provided advice to residents who wish to take measures to prevent mayflies from entering their homes. These include switching off their lights when not in use as mayflies are attracted to light, installing insect screens at their windows or drawing their curtains, if needed. PUB has been carrying out regular checks around Lower Seletar Reservoir to monitor the counts of mayflies. Routine fogging for general pest control and mosquito control are carried out around the reservoir grounds and this routine fogging will also kill mayflies.I would like to once again assure members and residents of Nee Soon South that mayflies are harmless insects and an essential part of our natural aquatic ecosystem. Therefore, we seek residents' understanding and tolerance, should they find these harmless mayflies in their homes."
sightings of crocodiles in sembawang,"Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether the Ministry has done any follow-up to verify reported sightings of crocodiles in Sembawang; (b) how many of such sightings have been confirmed by the Ministry over the past 12 months; and (c) when the sightings are verified, whether there are plans to trap and relocate these crocodiles.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: I thank Dr Lim Wee Kiak for his question regarding the crocodile sightings in Sembawang.PUB was first alerted to a crocodile sighting in Sungei Sembawang, on 10 March 2017. Follow-up inspections at the reported location were conducted together with AVA to confirm the sightings. However, during the joint-inspections, AVA and PUB did not spot any crocodile in the area. There are safety railings and ""do-not-enter"" warning signs installed along Sungei Sembawang to deter people from entering the waterway. As an additional precaution, PUB is installing wire mesh at the lower rungs of the railings at the reported location to act as a physical barrier between the water and the footpath. This will be completed by end August.Before this recent spate of sightings at Sungei Sembawang, there have been four confirmed sightings in our reservoirs over the past five years. Currently, the crocodile has stayed within the waterway. Nevertheless, we are monitoring the situation with AVA and we will take steps to trap and relocate it, should the reptile venture outside its inland habitat. Notwithstanding this, should members of the public encounter a crocodile, they should remain calm and keep a safe distance away from it. Public are reminded to not approach, provoke or feed the animal. They should also not enter the waterways at all times."
use of cpf funds for children's tuition fees,"Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Manpower (a) in the last three years, what is the number of CPF account holders who have taken loans under the CPF Education Scheme to help their children pay for their tuition fees at approved educational institutions; (b) what is the percentage of these CPF account holders who have had their loans paid back by their children; and (c) whether the Government can consider allowing the children to redeem such loans through deductions from the children's CPF savings.","Mr Lim Swee Say: The CPF Education Scheme is a loan scheme for CPF members to support their own, spouses', or children’s full-time subsidised tertiary education at local Approved Educational Institutions.From 2014 to 2016, about 30,000 CPF members have successfully applied for loans under the CPF Education Scheme to pay for their children's tuition fees. Over the same period, about 98% of outstanding loans due for repayment were fully settled.Mr Sapari asked whether children can repay the outstanding education loan using their CPF savings instead of cash. This is not allowed as they need to build up their CPF savings for other uses such as housing, healthcare and retirement.We recognise that some students may find it difficult to repay the loan immediately after graduation. Hence, students are only required to start repaying the loan one year upon graduation or after leaving their course of study. This gives them some time to find a job before starting repayments. Students who face difficulty repaying the full loan amount can apply for deferment or choose to make payments via monthly instalments for up to 12 years."
paid annual home leave for foreign domestic workers,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Ministry will consider making it mandatory for employers to provide paid annual home leave to foreign domestic workers.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: Home leave arrangements, like those for rest days, are mutually agreed between FDWs and employers. In MOM's FDW Study 2015, 56% of FDWs said they were provided with home leave either annually or at the point of renewal of their work passes. In addition, some employers also grant additional compassionate leave to their FDWs to deal with issues arising from unforeseen family circumstances back home.Making annual home leave compulsory for all may not be practical given that households have very different needs and home care arrangements. Unlike companies that have a pool of employees to cover for those on leave, household employers typically employ only one FDW and will have to make significant adjustments to look for alternative arrangements when FDWs go on home leave. At the same time, some FDWs might prefer to be paid more in lieu of annual home leave. As such, the current approach provides greater flexibility for both FDWs and employers to mutually agree to leave arrangements as part of the employment contracts.Whatever the arrangements, employers are expected to ensure the well-being of their FDWs throughout their stay in Singapore. In addition, MOM and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) like the Centre for Domestic Employees also actively reach out to FDWs to check on their well-being and that they are well adjusted to working in Singapore."
availability of heavy vehicle lots around hdb towns,"Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether he can provide an update on how the Government will better ensure availability of heavy vehicle lots around HDB towns; and (b) whether there is a guideline on how accessible these lots need to be, whether by distance or travel time to nearby HDB towns.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Currently, there are about 44,000 heavy vehicle parking spaces island-wide, which exceeds the 33,000 heavy vehicles registered with LTA under the Vehicle Parking Certificate (VPC) scheme. LTA's VPC scheme requires every heavy vehicle to have a certified overnight parking space before it is allowed to be registered or have its road tax renewed. Roughly 75% of the existing heavy vehicle parking spaces is provided by the private sector within industrial estates, which is where most heavy vehicles operate. The remaining 25% of heavy vehicle parking spaces is managed by URA and HDB in the form of temporary heavy vehicle parks located within or at the fringes of residential areas.There are practical difficulties in providing heavy vehicle parks in residential areas where land is needed for housing and other community uses. We have also received feedback of residents' concerns on noise and safety arising from heavy vehicular traffic in residential areas.Ultimately, it is the responsibility of business owners to have parking solutions for the vehicles they own, and also to work out with their drivers the appropriate transport options to commute to work."
standard bar code label on drugs as safeguard,"Ms K Thanaletchimi asked the Minister for Health whether it can be made mandatory for all manufacturers or suppliers of drugs to have a standard bar code with product name, batch number and expiry date on its unit pack before they are imported, registered and sold in Singapore so as to safeguard the integrity of the drugs and to facilitate drug traceability.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Today, the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) requires all manufacturers, importers and wholesalers of drugs to be licensed. To ensure traceability and supply chain integrity, they will need to keep records for every receipt and supply of drugs, and comply with standards in distribution. A drug's product name, batch number, expiry date and registration number will have to be indicated on each unit pack. In addition, HSA carries out post-market surveillance on quality or safety concerns arising from drugs.HSA agrees that a standardised bar-coding system can further improve drug traceability. Unfortunately, there is yet to be an internationally harmonised bar-coding standard for drug manufacturers and suppliers. Given our small market size, imposing our own requirement for all drug manufacturers and suppliers to adopt a standard bar-code could lead to companies being deterred from bringing their drugs into Singapore or passing on the additional cost to patients. This would not be beneficial to Singaporeans.HSA will continue to monitor international developments in this area. At the same time, it will continue to improve on its current system on drug safety and traceability."
electric vehicles for public transport and government agencies,Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether the Ministry will consider requiring all public buses to be electric buses or to convert transport vehicles procured by the Government to run on electric energy.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Vehicles are one of the key local sources of air pollutants including Particulate Matter (PM) and Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) which may cause lung cancer and chronic respiratory symptoms over the longer term. My Ministry commissioned a study last year to identify cleaner vehicular technologies suitable for Singapore, especially as alternatives to diesel vehicles. One of the findings of the study was that electrification was promising for many vehicle types, including buses. However, the study also surfaced the challenges including higher costs, reduced carrying capacity, long charging times, limited travel range and disposal of used batteries.To assess the feasibility of larger-scale deployment of alternative energy buses in Singapore, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) will be conducting trials of 50 hybrid and 60 electric buses over the next two years.Meanwhile, my Ministry is studying the feasibility of requiring Government agencies to use greener vehicles for their operations. We are currently evaluating the costs and the environmental impact of the different options available, including that of electric vehicles."
actions against short-term rentals of homes,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether there has been an increasing number of cases reported for illegal short-term rentals in private properties via apps such as Airbnb; (b) what actions have the Ministry taken against recalcitrant owners who continue to engage in such illegal short-term rentals; and (c) what can residents do to report such breaches in view of the consequent security concerns.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The number of cases reported for short-term rentals in private homes has risen over the past few years. The number of such reports rose from 377 in 2015 to 608 in 2016. For 2017, there have been 415 reports as of July.Residents who suspect their neighbours of conducting short-term rentals can provide feedback to the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA). The URA reviews public feedback about short-term rentals regardless of whether the cited infringement is facilitated by online applications or by other platforms.Once the URA establishes a case of short-term rental activity in violation of the Planning Act, it will serve an enforcement notice on the party responsible for the offence. In most cases, offenders have complied and ceased the unauthorised use. In the case of recalcitrant offenders, and in egregious cases of parties operating multiple short-term rental units in a single development, the URA will take court action against them for a breach of the Planning Act."
checks on hawkers to prevent touting,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether the Ministry conducts checks on hawkers in food centres and other public areas such as Lau Pa Sat on a regular basis to ensure that there is no touting; and (b) what are the consequences when hawkers and their assistants are found to be doing so.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The National Environment Agency (NEA) does not have the mandate to enforce against touting in privately-managed food centres such as Lau Pa Sat, coffee-shops or foodcourts in shopping malls.However, in the 110 hawker centres owned and managed by the Government, touting is expressly disallowed and NEA officers will keep a lookout for touting activities during their inspections. Those hawkers and hawker assistants who are found touting and harassing customers could have their tenancies terminated. Members of the public who want to provide feedback on touting in these centres can do so via the NEA's website, the myENV mobile application and the NEA 24-hour Call Centre."
preparedness of our population for emergency,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether any study has been done to determine the preparedness of our population for any emergency.,"Mr K Shanmugam: Emergency preparedness is fundamentally about building confidence in our ability to respond to an emergency. To gauge the emergency preparedness of our population, we can look at three facets: first, awareness and knowledge of the types of emergencies that we may face and what needs to be done in each scenario; second, whether the population is taking active steps to pick up the skills required to respond in an emergency; and third, whether the population will stay united and resilient in the face of crisis.In 2015, the National Security Awareness Survey (NSAS) found that our residents were generally aware of the range of possible emergency scenarios, and were confident of our ability to respond to the emergencies as a nation. Between 80% to 90% of respondents felt that the Government is well prepared to deal with crises such as a terrorist attack, communal riot, health pandemic, and shortages of water, food and energy.While respondents generally felt that they were less prepared as individuals compared to the Government in dealing with crises, the NSAS findings suggested that they would be better prepared if they had encountered a similar emergency scenario before. For instance, our residents felt they were most prepared to deal with a health pandemic, likely due to their past experiences with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, and H1N1 influenza outbreak in 2009.On the second facet of skills, our residents have been taking practical steps to prepare themselves to respond to an emergency. The 2015 NSAS found that more than 50% of our residents have a First Aid Kit at home; for those without a First Aid Kit, 80% of them knew where to find the essential items in their homes for use in first aid. There was also increasing alertness to suspicious behaviour, items and activities. Likewise, an increasing number of people are aware of what to do when they hear a SCDF public warning siren.Third, on unity and resilience, the survey found that 90% of our people believed that everyone has a role to play in ensuring our nation's safety and security, and were willing to help others during emergencies. About 80% also believed that we will stand united, regardless of race or religion, and that Singapore will continue to function effectively in times of crisis.While these are encouraging findings, more can be done to raise our people's awareness of new threats and the responses required, and help them to pick up the necessary skills.For instance, with Singapore continuing to face the highest terror threat level in recent years, we launched the SGSecure movement last September to raise preparedness among residents and galvanise a ""whole of population"" response to terrorism. To help members of public pick up useful skills, the Home Team and our partners have introduced various advisories, tools and programmes. This includes the series of revamped Emergency Preparedness Days which is being rolled out to all constituencies to give residents the opportunity to observe a live terrorist attack exercise in their neighbourhood, and pick up relevant emergency preparedness skills.Crisis Response Exercises (CRXs) are also conducted at the constituency-level for grassroots and other community leaders. Through these exercises, participants gain the knowledge and skills to assist the community and maintain social cohesion after a terrorist attack.Besides preparing our community to handle terror attacks, we also conduct regular Safety & Security Watch Group (SSWG) exercises at commercial and industrial premises. In these exercises, businesses, their in-house security as well as their Company Emergency Response Team (CERT) practise their contingency plans with responders from the Police and Civil Defence. This helps businesses validate their workplace crisis response capabilities, and ensure that they are able to undertake critical functions such as basic fire-fighting, cordoning and evacuation in the initial phases of an emergency, before the authorities arrive.The level of preparedness of our population will also rise over time through combating national crises together. Our response to past emergencies such as SARS, H1N1 and the haze have made us better prepared and mentally more resilient should such emergencies occur in the future.Emergency preparedness is an ongoing, whole-of-society effort. We will continue to raise emergency preparedness among our community and mobilise our people to play their part."
percentage of pro-family and pro-breast-feeding companies,"Ms K Thanaletchimi asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how many companies are currently slated as ""family-friendly"" companies in absolute numbers and as a percentage of all companies in Singapore; (b) how extensively do companies support female workers who are breast-feeding their infants; (c) what new support systems are put in place to make the workplace environment a nurturing one for mothers and their families; (d) how do companies detect and provide emotive care for mothers who are in depression especially new mothers; and (e) what are the new initiatives that can be learned from countries that are successful in promoting ""family-friendly"" workplaces.","Mr Lim Swee Say: MOM is committed to helping Singaporeans fulfil their aspirations for career and family. Through the concerted efforts of our tripartite partners, we have seen improvements as more workplaces adopt family-friendly practices.The International Labour Organisation (ILO) has identified flexible working arrangements (FWAs) as a key family-friendly measure that matters to employees. Increasingly, employers in Singapore have also recognised the importance of FWAs. In 2016, 47% of establishments offered formal FWAs, compared to 38% in 2011. As a result, 67% of employees in Singapore work in companies offering formal FWAs, up from 56% in 2011. This does not include companies that offer FWAs on an ad-hoc basis.To support employers' efforts to foster more family-friendly workplaces, the Government offers generous grants, such as the WorkPro Work-Life Grant. Employers can tap on these grants to set up private lactation rooms at workplaces. For example, Greenwave Systems, a software and services company, has benefitted from the Work-Life Grant. Today, one quarter of Greenwave's employees utilise staggered hours and telecommuting options. In addition, Greenwave has lactation facilities, and permits staff to bring their children to work if they are unable to arrange for a carer.A 2016 survey conducted by NTUC found that 60% of working mothers had access to private lactation rooms or spaces at their workplaces, up from 35% in 2013. In addition, the Health Promotion Board conducts Management Training Workshops to help managers and HR personnel recognise common mental health issues, including depression. This will help companies provide appropriate emotional support to their employees, including new mothers.The tripartite partners continue to learn from other countries and try different ideas to make workplaces more family-friendly. The Returner Work Trial, which was announced by NTUC in July, will provide support for back-to-work parents to return to the workforce. In addition, the tripartite partners are jointly developing a Tripartite Standard on Flexible Work Arrangements to help employees identify companies with strong support for FWAs.Both employers and employees benefit from family-friendly workplaces. MOM will continue to work with our tripartite partners to grow the community of progressive employers with family-friendly workplaces."
cashback features in hire-purchase schemes,Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) whether the Ministry will consider regulating hire-purchase schemes that incorporate upfront cash back to hirers as these schemes contain features akin to money lending,"39 Dr Tan Wu Meng asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (a) whether cashback features in hire-purchase schemes constitute a form of moneylending; (b) whether such schemes are de facto unsecured loans when goods depreciate quickly; (c) in 2016, what proportion of buyers have defaulted on their payments for three months or more; (d) whether such a market is sub-prime; and (e) whether additional regulation is needed.Mr S Iswaran: Today, hire purchase schemes and moneylending activities are regulated under the Hire Purchase Act and the Moneylenders Act respectively.Hire purchase is one of a range of options that consumers can choose from to finance their purchases. Hire purchase schemes are private commercial arrangements. We do not have information on the number of hire purchase schemes in the market and the default rates of such schemes.The various consumer financing options come with different terms and conditions to cater to the different needs of consumers. Some business schemes offer upfront cashback and gifts to attract consumers.However, consumers should be aware of the tradeoffs between the different schemes available in the market. For example, schemes without any upfront cashback or gifts typically have lower interest rates and the repayment period is shorter. Conversely, schemes with very attractive upfront cashback or gifts, come with much higher interest rates and a longer repayment period. The total amount that consumers pay for their purchases would be higher under such schemes, potentially more than double the value of the goods they purchase.The Hire Purchase Act specifies the minimum information that companies must provide to consumers in writing before they enter into a hire purchase agreement. This includes information on the charges for early settlement of the agreement; effective interest rates; interest rates for overdue instalments and administrative charges. We strongly encourage consumers to review the terms carefully and assess their ability to meet the financial commitments before signing the agreement. The Monetary Authority of Singapore will also be working with MoneySENSE, the national financial education program, to raise consumer awareness on business schemes that come with upfront cashback.While upfront cashback payment to consumers does not constitute money lending under the Moneylenders Act, it is still a form of credit extension to consumers. The Government is watching closely the practice of businesses offering significant cashback amounts with their schemes. We take a serious view of business practices that irresponsibly entice consumers to take up excessive credit and will not hesitate to take action or review our regulations, if necessary, to restrict such practices."
instructions on safe use of personal mobility devices,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Manpower for employees who are required to use bicycles or personal mobility devices (PMDs) in the course of their work, how does the Ministry ensure that (i) they are adequately instructed by their employers on the road traffic rules and safe use of bicycles or PMDs (ii) employers have a system of monitoring their employees on such compliance and (iii) employers provide adequate insurance for their employees in respect of injury, death and third party claims arising from any accidents while using bicycles or PMDs in the course of work.","Mr Lim Swee Say: Under the Workplace Safety and Health Act (WSHA), all companies are required to ensure the safety and health of their workers. This includes providing them with adequate safety measures, instructions, training and supervision. This obligation extends to their use of bicycles or personal mobility devices (PMDs) in the course of work.In addition to WSHA, the Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Council has provided specific details of the companies’ responsibility in its ""Guidelines on Traffic Safety Management"". For example, companies should have a risk management process to identify and mitigate risks to riders, ensure proper training, and adopt best practices such as providing incentives for safe behaviour. Failure to comply with these guidelines can be used as an aggravating factor against companies in court in the event of work-related accidents and injuries. With the Active Mobility Bill passed in Parliament earlier this year, the WSH Council is working with the Land Transport Authority to release new WSH guidelines on employers’ responsibility to ensure safe and responsible use of bicycles and PMDs for work purposes.To ensure compliance of traffic safety by employers and workers, MOM inspects workplaces providing dispatch, food delivery and logistics services, as well as other companies assessed to have a high risk of traffic injuries or fatalities. In 2016, 101 of such companies were inspected, and 63 Notices of Non Compliance were issued to 38 companies with poor traffic safety management. As there has been increased use of bicycles and PMDs in dispatch and food delivery services, we have stepped up our inspections on such companies.Any employee injured in the course of work is entitled to compensation under the Work Injury Compensation Act (WICA). This includes injuries and deaths arising from the use of a bicycle or PMD.If a third party has been injured as a result of a worker’s actions, MOM will investigate the company and worker for possible breach under the WSH Act. The injured third party may also take up civil claim against the company or worker through the legal process."
protection of public hospitals against security threats,Ms K Thanaletchimi asked the Minister for Health (a) how safe are the public hospitals in terms of security protection; (b) whether the Ministry will consider providing 24/7 security services by the Home Team as it had done in the past; and (c) how prepared are the hospitals in tackling a terrorist attack in such open premises.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: MOH has been working with MHA on the security protection of our public hospitals. Each hospital has put in place preventive security measures, physical security operations, contingency plans covering incident response and consequence management to deal with different scenarios and threat levels, including terrorist incidents. Assessments are carried out regularly on the competencies of the security personnel. In addition, there are programmes to raise security awareness among staff, patients and visitors. Hospitals also conduct regular training and exercises including with the Home Team forces.In the event of a security incident, our public hospitals are resourced with their own security personnel onsite who can provide immediate response to ""deny, delay and contain"", while waiting for the arrival of Home Team quick response forces where necessary. The plan also covers appropriate actions by staff, patients and visitors, including evacuation.Our public hospitals are receiving ongoing support from Home Team agencies. They have participated in the Safety and Security Watch Group scheme with the Police and SCDF to strengthen the safety and security of their patient and staff on their premises and learn from good practices. The majority of public hospitals have also signed up as Project Guardian members, and their security personnel are trained to react and complement Police response to an incident. The Police conduct regular patrols at public hospitals and their vicinity. These include patrols by the Emergency Response Teams, who are trained and equipped to respond to a terrorist incident. During periods of heightened alert, the Home Team may deploy additional forces to beef up the security of the hospitals.We will continue to work closely with MHA and the Home Team on security preparedness and response at our public hospitals."
proportion of 999 calls that were emergencies and required police intervention,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) how many 999 calls have been made annually in the last three years; (b) what proportion of these calls were for emergencies or which required direct police intervention; and (c) how does the police handle calls which do not require police attention and what measures are available to reduce such calls which drain police resources.,"Mr K Shanmugam: Between 2014 and 2016, Police received an average of about 1.3 million '999' calls annually. This amounts to slightly more than 3,500 calls every day.About 40% of these calls required direct Police intervention, and Police resources were dispatched. The remaining calls were either nuisance calls or misdirected calls that did not require Police attention. There was a wide range of misdirected calls, including complaints on municipal issues like the cleanliness of common properties, and issues under other agencies' purview such as illegal hawking.When Police emergency call operators receive misdirected calls, they will advise the callers on the proper channels to report such issues. Examples of such channels include the feedback lines of the relevant statutory boards or town councils. The Police also regularly educate the public on the correct use of the ‘999’ hotline, through engaging schools and partnering the media.The Police must be ready to respond to genuine emergency requests. Nuisance and misdirected calls may deprive persons in distress of timely Police intervention as the Police emergency call operators would be bogged down by these calls. If Police resources were to be dispatched to false cases reported by irresponsible callers, this will take our officers away from real emergencies. Where necessary, the Police will in consultation with the Attorney-General’s Chambers, prosecute recalcitrant nuisance callers in court.The Police will continue their efforts to reduce nuisance and misdirected calls."
enforcement actions against illegal sale of contraband cigarettes,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Finance (a) in the past five years, how many cases of illegal sales of contraband cigarettes have been reported and the sellers charged; (b) how many of them caught in such illegal activity are locals and foreigners respectively; and (c) whether the existing penalty is sufficient to deter such illegal activity or to encourage the sellers to work with authorities to locate the ultimate beneficiary.","Mr Heng Swee Keat: Strong enforcement efforts and close-interagency collaboration have kept the peddling of contraband cigarettes in check. From 2012 to 2016, the number of peddlers caught remained relatively stable, averaging about 400 per year. About 80% of those arrested were charged in court, while the rest were issued a composition sum or stern warning.In the same period, the total number of contraband cigarette offenders caught each year, which includes smugglers, peddlers and buyers, fell by 29% from 28,502 in 2012 to 20,147 in 2016.The Member also asked whether existing penalties are sufficient deterrents. In 2012, we enhanced the penalties for dealing in contraband cigarettes. Upon conviction, for first time offenders, a minimum court fine of $2,000 would be imposed, and the maximum court fine is 20 times the amount of the taxes evaded. For repeat offenders caught with more than 2kg of contraband tobacco products, mandatory imprisonment for up to six years was also introduced. To date, our penalties have been effective in keeping the contraband cigarette situation in check.Singapore Customs will continue to work with other enforcement agencies to deter the buying and selling of contraband cigarettes. We will also continue to actively engage the public to raise awareness on this issue."
reach and effectiveness of pioneer generation disability assistance scheme,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Health (a) how many pioneers currently receive payouts under the Pioneer Generation Disability Assistance Scheme; (b) what has been the number of applications each year since the scheme was introduced; (c) what percentage has been successful each year; (d) what has been the number of uncompleted applications each year; and (e) whether the Ministry assesses that the scheme has been effective in addressing the needs of pioneers with disabilities.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Pioneer Generation Disability Assistance Scheme (PioneerDAS) was introduced in September 2014 as part of the Pioneer Generation (PG) Package for a special generation of Singaporeans. PioneerDAS is one of the measures amongst broader Government support for long-term care, which includes means-tested subsidies at senior care centres and nursing homes, the Seniors' Mobility and Enabling Fund and the Foreign Domestic Worker Grant. The Government also provides public assistance, Comcare and Medifund for those who face financial difficulties and need more help.From its launch in September 2014 to end 2014, the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) received around 6,700 applications. The application numbers in 2015 and 2016 were about 9,000 and 8,600 respectively. About 95% of applications have been approved.To help more Pioneers, AIC has extended automatic PioneerDAS inclusion to Pioneers receiving payouts under ElderShield or the Interim Disability Assistance Programme for the Elderly, or those who qualify for the Foreign Domestic Worker Grant. This auto-inclusion has benefited an additional 15,000 Pioneers."
fire alarms for all hdb blocks,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry will consider installing fire alarm systems for all HDB blocks.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB buildings are designed to meet the prevailing Fire Code requirements.Each residential unit is designed as a fire compartment to prevent the spread of fire to adjacent units. Fire-rated entrance door, walls and floors constructed of concrete and masonry will act as effective fire barriers. Common corridors and lift lobbies are also designed to be naturally ventilated for quick smoke dispersal. Adequate number of exit staircases located at an allowable distance from the unit entrances provide a safe means of escape out of the building in the event of a fire.To facilitate fire-fighting, dry or wet rising mains, fire engine access roads, fire-fighting lobbies and firemen lifts are also provided where required under the Fire Code.For standalone residential blocks, fire alarm systems and sprinkler systems are currently not required by the Fire Code due to the low risk of fire spread. However, for mixed developments, where there is integration of different uses (residential, commercial, social communal and carparks), sprinkler or fire alarm systems will be installed where required by the Fire Code."
human resources industry's role in helping jobseekers,"Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for Manpower whether the human resource industry can play a more contributory role to help local job seekers, new entrants and re-entrants in the job market in the new economic landscape and whether they can help to minimise missed matches in the labour market in the next phase of our economic growth.","Mr Lim Swee Say: The HR industry, comprising HR professionals and HR service providers, plays an important role in helping our workers adapt and grow in the future economy. To be effective, three shifts are needed.One is a mindset shift from looking at workers as ""Human Resource"" (HR) – a commodity to be acquired and utilised with value depreciating over time, to treating workers as ""Human Capital"" (HC) – an asset to be invested and nurtured with value appreciating over time. It means not just having a ""hunter"" mentality, poaching talent from the market for immediate plug and play. But a ""grower"" mentality to nurture and develop talent so their value to the organisation increases over time.Two is a shift in practices from qualifications-based hiring to skills-based recruitment and development. It means not being too reliant on educational qualifications and years of experience as proxies for candidates' suitability, but instead develop competency assessment tools or work trials that holistically assess job fit.Three is a shift towards promoting an inclusive workplace through fair consideration for jobs and adopting progressive workplace practices. This allows employers to reach a wider pool of talent and bring about better business performance and higher employee engagement.To help make this transition, we have stepped up efforts to strengthen the capabilities of HR professionals. The Institute for Human Resource Professionals (IHRP) was recently set up by the tripartite partners to implement the national HR certification regime, known as IHRP Certification. To be successfully certified, HR professionals have to demonstrate knowledge in applying over 30 competencies and behaviours expected of a future-ready HR professional. Interest in the IHRP Certification has been encouraging, with over 700 HR professionals registering their interest to pursue the certification.HR professionals and HR service providers should tap on the many Professional Conversion Programmes (PCP). There are more than 70 PCPs across more than 30 sectors today, and we expect this number to grow. HR professionals can also play their part by creating intra-company PCPs, to help equip their employees with skills their company will need in the future. If it is necessary to retrench their workforce, HR professionals can help minimise mismatches and missed matches through progressive and responsible practices.Collectively, these efforts will help our workforce better adapt to take on better jobs and build new careers in our future economy."
government's assistance for developers of mobile apps for foreign workers,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Manpower with regard to the partnership with the private sector to develop mobile apps for foreign workers (a) whether the content and information provided to the partners are publicly available; (b) if so, what concrete benefits are there for the partners; and (c) whether transactional e-services such as the reporting of employment-related incidents will be included in the apps and, if so, whether the Ministry will fund such app development.","Mr Lim Swee Say: MOM called for partnership with the private sector to jointly reach out to more foreign workers through existing or new mobile apps in January 2017. There is no payment involved as it is a win-win partnership for both parties.To help foreign workers better understand their employment rights as well as responsibilities under the work permit conditions, MOM disseminates such information through various outreach platforms, including the MOM website, guidebooks and collaterals given out at our Services Centre, dormitories and roadshows. We also produce videos for use at our engagement events.However, with the increasing use of smart phones and mobile apps, there is scope for us to leverage on this growing mode of communication to expand our outreach to the foreign workers. Instead of developing our own mobile apps which will only include government contents, we are partnering with owners and developers of mobile apps to provide a fuller suite of services that may be more effective in meeting the needs of the various target groups of foreign workers.On our part, we bring several benefits to the partnership. These include packaging and tailoring of information relevant to the needs of the foreign workers targeted by the respective apps; translating the information into native languages such as Bengali, Tamil and Chinese; sharing our findings on the mobile usage behaviour of foreign workers as well as their online interests and preferences. In addition, given our extensive touch points and outreach channels with the foreign workers community, MOM can assist in creating greater awareness of the apps.To enable foreign workers to send in comments on how to improve the app or to report on employment-related issues, our partnership requires the inclusion of a feedback module. However, our partners are not required to develop transactional MOM e-services as these are already available on the MOM website. Instead, they may provide the links to these e-services if they find it to be useful and attractive to their targeted users.These commercial apps are fully owned by our private sector partners. The partnership is not exclusive. We have signed MOUs with two app developers who saw the mutual benefits of such a partnership. Since June, we have received more than 30 enquiries from interested parties. Among them, eight have submitted proposals which we are currently evaluating."
index to track business costs by category,"Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Trade) whether the Government will consider having trade councils or business chambers work with professional think-tanks to come up with an annual sectoral business costs index to track business costs by category, such as rentals, wages, transportation, raw materials, equipment, fees and charges, to assist the Government in deriving sector-specific policies for transforming our industries.","Mr Lim Hng Kiang: The Government publishes a range of data on business costs on a regular basis, from the business cost structure of companies in the key business sectors, to trends in key business cost components such as labour and rental costs. For instance, the Department of Statistics (DOS) compiles and publishes the Unit Labour Cost (ULC) Index, which measures the change in labour cost per unit of real output, at the overall economy level and for key business sectors on a quarterly basis. Similarly, rental indices for industrial space and commercial space are compiled and published by JTC and the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) respectively on a quarterly basis.Specifically for the manufacturing sector, DOS compiles an overall Unit Business Cost (UBC) Index on a quarterly basis. The main components of the UBC Index are labour cost, services cost and government rates and fees. The services cost component in turn includes work given out, rentals, utilities and transport costs. As for overall business cost trends in the services sector, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) estimates and tracks the Unit Business Cost Index for the Services Sector (UBC-Services Index), which is used alongside other cost and price indicators for monetary policy purposes. For a summary of the business cost structure and latest trends in business costs, Members can refer to the Economic Survey of Singapore published by MTI.At the same time, the Government welcomes private sector initiatives to deepen insights into business trends that would inform and facilitate industry transformation efforts. For instance, the Local Enterprise and Association Development (LEAD) programme, which is co-administered by SPRING and IE Singapore, supports Trade Associations & Chambers (TACs) in driving industry development initiatives. These include intelligence and research projects that would lead to the development of industry-specific solutions."
review of hdb blocks in hougang for lift upgrading programme,Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for National Development whether he will provide an update on the review status of the HDB blocks in Hougang that are not under the Lift Upgrading Programme and what will be the fate of these blocks that will not get LUP after the review.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP) was introduced in 2001 to provide direct lift access to flats and enhance convenience for residents, especially the elderly and less mobile. At the start of the programme, there were more than 5,300 HDB blocks where not all dwelling units have direct lift access. Among them, more than 1,000 blocks were initially found to be unfeasible for LUP due to cost or technical constraints.Over the years, HDB has adopted innovative technical solutions to help flats in these affected blocks achieve direct lift access. Some examples of solutions that have been successfully implemented include lifts that do not have a machine room at the top of the shafts (that is, machine room-less lifts), creation of new entry points to residents' homes, and the use of smaller ""home lifts"".More recently, HDB piloted new solutions like the Pneumatic Vacuum Elevator at Lorong 6 Toa Payoh and the Vertical Platform Lift at Petir Road, but both were found to be unfeasible.Nonetheless, through the various innovative solutions, the vast majority of the 5,300 blocks have benefitted from LUP over the years. There remains about 150 blocks where it is still not possible to implement LUP due to prohibitive costs, or existing technical or site constraints. This includes six blocks in Hougang SMC. Residents living in these blocks who are in urgent need of direct lift access due to medical conditions or disability may approach HDB for housing and financing assistance. HDB will assess each request on a case-by-case basis to see how best to render help."
joint effort between sportsg and football association of singapore to promote local football,"Mr Ganesh Rajaram asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth how can SportSG work with the Football Association of Singapore to improve the quality of local football, the attendance at S League matches and Singapore's position in the FIFA World Rankings which has been declining.","Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: Sport Singapore (SportSG) works in partnership with National Sports Associations (NSAs), including the Football Association of Singapore (FAS), to develop their sports. SportSG brings to the table, the provision of training facilities, technical expertise for High Performance Sports (HPS), an extensive network of members for grassroots development, and funding support. Starting this year, Tote Board is channelling its funding for FAS through SportSG.As with other NSAs, FAS is required to submit to SportSG its multiyear strategic plans for the sport, so that the plans, including desired outcomes, can be discussed and agreed upon. The plans will include areas such as youth and coaching development, community outreach and participation, as well as football excellence which includes the review of the S League.SportSG is collaborating with FAS to develop football in Singapore, as seen in the recent merger of the FAS Cubs programme with the ActiveSG Football Academy in March to encourage more youth participation in football. The Ministry hopes to see an effective partnership between SportSG and FAS in developing local football and improving the performance of our national team."
career counselling for polytechnic students,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) whether polytechnic students are getting sufficient information about the wide range of careers in Singapore.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: In the polytechnics, there is a structured ECG curriculum in place, delivered by the lecturers with the support of the ECG Counsellors on campus. This is complemented by a wide range of resources made available to students such as labour market information and information on upgrading opportunities. Students will also be able to access the MySkillsFuture portal, once it becomes available later this year, where they can easily retrieve information on courses, job opportunities and the latest industry developments.To enable students to find out more about their industries of interest, the polytechnics also organise career fairs, company visits and talks by alumni or industry practitioners regularly. These events ensure that students are updated on the growth prospects of the industry, and aware of what working in the industry will be like, and the requirements to join the industry.There are also opportunities for deeper exposure to specific companies and industries through internships and mentorships. Internships are an integral component of polytechnic education, which allow students to experience realistic work conditions, develop relevant skillsets and better assess their career options and preferences."
bicycle location services for bike-share operators,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether LTA is able to obtain data from bike-share operators to draw a heatmap of indiscriminately parked bicycles and leverage on that data to prioritise where to locate more bicycle parking zones; and (b) whether the level of enforcement against indiscriminately parked bike-share bicycles differs between private and HDB estates.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: LTA uses heat maps from bicycle-sharing operators, as well as data collected by its own enforcement officers and from public feedback, to identify areas where we need to build more bicycle parking zones and increase enforcement.The same enforcement approach is taken against indiscriminately parked bicycles in all public spaces, including in HDB estates and on public streets outside private property. We do not have jurisdiction over private land. Private landowners have the right to remove objects left on their property without permission."
upgrading ageing bus depots,"Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether there are any plans to upgrade ageing bus depots, in particular those built over 30 years ago; and (b) if yes, when will these be upgraded.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: All the older bus depots are progressively being upgraded or replaced by new ones. In the last five years, we have built three new depots. In the next five years, we are planning to upgrade or build around five more. In deciding which depots to upgrade, LTA considers the age of the depot as well as other factors like site constraints and operational requirements."
parking of vehicles by car rental companies at residential estates,Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for Transport what measures are in place to ensure that car rental companies do not abuse roads in residential estates as parking spaces for their hire cars when not hired out.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Where the roads in the private residential estates are public roads, and where parking is allowed along these public roads, the Land Transport Authority cannot forbid any individual or company from parking there."
impact of completion of sutd and mit tie-up,Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) what impact will the completion of the seven-year educational partnership between the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have on SUTD's future enrollment and positioning of the young university.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: When the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) was established, it was envisaged that in time to come, it would graduate from its formal collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). After seven years, that time has come, as SUTD gears itself for its next phase of development. This is similar to how the Singapore Management University jumpstarted its development in partnership with the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania when it was first formed.Over the past seven years, SUTD has benefitted immensely from its partnership with MIT. SUTD's structure and curriculum, including 90% of its undergraduate course materials, was designed and co-developed with MIT faculty. These are unique features of SUTD, which MIT would have done if it were to re-design its institutional structure and develop its curriculum all over again. Current and future students will continue to learn using these materials.Through the collaboration, SUTD has received full accreditation from the Engineering Accreditation Board for its Bachelor of Engineering and Master of Architecture degree programmes, and it is now fully equipped to provide these programmes independently.Over the same period, SUTD has established itself as a popular choice among students. Applications have increased over the years, from 2,144 in 2013 to 3,503 this year – a 63% increase. Admissions have also increased by 69% over the same period, from 251 to 424.SUTD graduates are also well-endorsed by employers. As reported in the 2015 and 2016 Graduate Employment Surveys, more than 90% of its graduates have obtained employment within six months of completing their final examinations, and earn monthly starting salaries ranging from $3,600-$4,000, which compare very well with that of other local universities.SUTD has also begun to establish itself as a high quality, research-intensive university in design, engineering, technology, and architecture. It has research collaborations with the Temasek Laboratories and ST Engineering.Looking ahead, SUTD will continue to collaborate with MIT, in research collaboration and also student exchanges, albeit not under a formal partnership agreement. SUTD will in fact expand its network of collaboration partners, with universities in different parts of the world.In short, SUTD is well positioned to be a unique and high quality university – well-regarded, reputable amongst employers and students, with a strong international network of partners. It will develop and grow to be stronger and better."
feasibility of public-private partnership for sports hub,"Mr Ganesh Rajaram asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) whether the public-private partnership between the Government and the Sports Hub remains viable and sustainable given the recurring concerns over operational, structural and management issues in the past two years; and (b) whether SportSG have officers experienced enough to deal effectively with the consortium managing the Sports Hub.","Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: Under the Sports Hub public-private partnership (PPP) arrangement, SportsHub Pte Ltd (SHPL) is contracted to design, build, finance and operate the Sports Hub for 25 years. It has delivered a 55,000-seat stadium, 3,000-seat aquatic centre, multi-purpose arena and other facilities. Since the commencement of operations in July 2014, the Sports Hub has played host to major events, including the SEA Games, ASEAN Para Games, National Day Parade, International Champions Cup, HSBC Singapore Rugby 7s and WTA Finals.Given the scale and complexity of the facilities, the project has faced challenges in the first three years of operations. More can and should be done by SHPL to enhance the vibrancy of the Sports Hub, and improve the quality of its calendar of events and programming. As with all major international venues, sustained effort and investment are needed to ensure progress for the project and to build up an exciting events calendar.Sport Singapore (SportSG) is in constant communication with SHPL's management, to ensure that the goals and objectives of the project are met. It has a dedicated team of officers who monitor SHPL's performance closely and holistically. Key members of the team have been involved with the project since its inception, and the team reports directly to the Chief Executive and Deputy Chief Executive of SportSG, who have extensive public sector experience.Like many Singaporeans, we have high expectations for the Sports Hub, and want to see the Sports Hub succeed as the integrated sports and lifestyle destination that we envisioned. The PPP arrangement enables the Government to leverage the international marketing, operations and financing expertise of the private sector partner."
ban of smoking at open windows of residential properties,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether the Ministry will (i) consider further measures to ban smoking at open windows of residential properties and (ii) review and mandate the provision of closed smoking rooms in residential properties for smokers to smoke so as not to affect non-smoking residents.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: My Ministry's long-term goal is to prohibit smoking in all public areas except at designated smoking areas to protect non-smokers from the harmful health effects of second-hand tobacco smoke.Over the years, my Ministry has progressively extended the smoking prohibition to more public areas. In 2013, the smoking prohibition was extended to the common areas in residential buildings, including common corridors, covered walkways, lift lobbies and stairwells.Our regulatory ambit does not extend to prohibiting smoking within one’s own residential property. At the Parliament sitting in August last year, we had informed the Member that smoking within one's residential property, which is a private space, is not prohibited and beyond the Government's jurisdiction. The Government has no plans to mandate the provision of closed smoking rooms in residential properties. In this respect, we encourage smokers to be socially responsible and considerate when smoking so that their neighbours living in close proximity would not be affected by the wafting of second-hand smoke.Residents who are affected by the wafting of second-hand tobacco smoke from their neighbour's residences should try to reach out to them to resolve the issues amicably. Residents can also approach the Community Mediation Centre for assistance."
impact of cessation of sand import from cambodia,"Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the impact of Cambodia's decision to cease the export of sand to Singapore; (b) what is the number of countries that continue to export sand to Singapore for reclamation purposes; and (c) what is the volume of sand imported into Singapore for reclamation, construction and any other purpose from every source country since 2007.","Mr Lawrence Wong: We have measures in place to ensure that Singapore is sufficiently prepared for disruption to our sand imports.First, Singapore imports sand on a commercial basis from a diverse range of countries, to ensure resilience in our sand supply. And we will continue to encourage industry players to procure sand from alternative sources.Second, we have also been encouraging the industry to reduce the reliance on sand. For construction, the industry is adopting more sustainable construction methods like using structural steel and mass engineered timber. We have also been recycling excavated materials from the construction industry to replace a proportion of sand in some reclamation projects. Most recently, we piloted a polder development in Pulau Tekong, which reduces the volume of sand needed as compared to traditional reclamation. The Government will continue to work with industry players to explore new and innovative means to reduce our reliance on sand.As for the Member's query on our sand import volumes, such figures vary from year to year depending on projects and availability. In 2016, we imported 35 million tonnes of sand. These figures are publicly available, similar to other traded commodities."
singaporeans in key leadership and management positions of autonomous universities,Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) whether the Ministry has any policy to encourage autonomous universities to have more Singaporeans in key leadership and management positions.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: Our policy is that Autonomous Universities (AUs) needs to build a strong core of Singaporeans in key leadership and management positions. Currently, Singaporeans make up around 70% of key leadership and management positions in the AUs. Three-quarters of Presidents and Provosts of Universities are Singaporeans.The AUs have in place talent development and leadership programmes to groom more Singaporeans to take on key leadership and management roles in their institution. They also actively reach out to leading Singaporean academics based overseas to attract them back to Singapore.The Ministry has also worked with the AUs to launch the Singapore Teaching and Academic Research Talent Scheme (or START in short) in 2015 to encourage more young Singaporeans to pursue an academic career. This year, we have awarded 38 undergraduate and postgraduate scholarships under START.Notwithstanding the need to encourage more Singaporeans to take on leadership positions and responsibilities in AUs, we must recognise the need for AUs to stay connected to the world, in both education and research. They must remain open to bringing in global talent who can contribute with their diverse perspectives and knowledge to ensure that our AUs continue to remain competitive and relevant in the world."
breakdown of programmes that received public service broadcast funds,"Mr Ganesh Rajaram asked the Minister for Communications and Information in the last financial year, what is the amount of Public Service Broadcast funds given to Mediacorp to finance the various programmes broken down into titles and genres, regardless whether they are produced in-house or are farmed out to independent production companies.","Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim: I thank Mr Ganesh Rajaram for his question on Public Service Broadcast (PSB) funds.Total PSB funding in FY16 was around $250 million. This supported the development of capabilities, channels and content, including about 3,000 hours of locally-produced PSB TV programmes to cater to the diverse viewing needs of Singaporeans.For content production, about 60% of PSB programme funding went towards current affairs, info-educational programmes and documentaries. The remaining 40% funded entertainment programmes such as local dramas, tele-movies and variety shows. PSB funding was also used to produce local content on digital platforms like Toggle, including shows like 'Yes Mdm' and 'Run Rachael Run', to cater to growing online media consumption."
raising maximum penalty for unattended bags at mrt stations,"Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether the maximum penalty of $1,000 melted out for leaving a bag unattended in an MRT station is sufficient to deter such future incidents considering that the incident has caused major disruption to operations and affected thousands of commuters.","Mr K Shanmugam: The recent case of unattended bag at Hougang MRT station led to the temporary closure of the station. Although it turned out to be a false alarm, our security agencies had to deal with it, and it inconvenienced commuters. The subject involved in the case was found guilty of the offence of public nuisance and fined $1,000.We are reviewing the need to enhance the penalties for such offences, to deter future occurrences.Given the high level of terrorism threat, the Police will continue to take all security-related reports seriously. The public is advised to stay vigilant and to report suspicious activities to the Police."
extension of child development account government dollar-for-dollar matching benefit,Mr Kok Heng Leun asked the Minister for Social and Family Development whether the Child Development Account dollar-for-dollar matching benefit can be extended to children of unwed parents born from 1 January 2005 to help support these families' efforts to care for their children and reduce the disadvantages that their children may face from birth.,"Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: Last year, we reviewed and extended the Child Development Account, or CDA benefits to children of unwed parents. The Government granted CDA benefits to children of unwed parents born, or with an estimated date of delivery, from 1 September 2016.It is generally good practice to implement our policies prospectively. Any extension or enhancement of an existing scheme should thus have its own start date.Unwed parents who may require more support can approach any Social Service Office for financial assistance or Family Service Centre for socio-emotional support."
government investigation of encrypted instant messaging apps,"Mr Seah Kian Peng asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether the Ministry is investigating encrypted instant messaging applications such as Telegram amid concerns that this is ""the app of choice"" for terrorists.","Mr K Shanmugam: MHA is aware that terrorist groups use social media applications like Telegram to spread their propaganda, for recruitment, and even operational planning.This is a challenge faced by many governments and security agencies worldwide. We are closely monitoring developments.To counter the spread of extremist and radical ideology, the family and community must play their part. We have repeatedly made this point, because it is critical. They must alert the authorities if they notice any signs of radicalisation in their family members, friends, or colleagues."
protection and rehabilitation of women of domestic abuse,"Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Social and Family Development how does the Ministry protect women who suffer from domestic abuse or emotional violence and work with NGOs to help rehabilitate these vulnerable persons so as to encourage them to gradually reintegrate into society, school and work.","Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: Protecting women experiencing physical or emotional abuse requires a strong partnership among Government agencies and community partners. My Ministry works closely with the Singapore Police Force, the Singapore Prisons Service, the Family Justice Courts, hospitals and community agencies to offer help to victims through the National Family Violence Networking System (NFVNS). The NFVNS was established more than 20 years ago and enables victims to receive assistance at various touch points, including Family Service Centres and Family Violence Specialist Centres. Interventions offered include counselling, group therapy and helping victims work out a suitable safety plan, with a view to reintegrate them back to the community. Where necessary, victims will receive temporary accommodation at crisis shelters. If needed, the victim will be referred for financial, housing, employment or child-care assistance. Those who require legal protection from an abusive family member may apply for a Personal Protection Order. The Court may also order the perpetrator and affected family members to receive counselling.Domestic violence is not a private matter. In November 2016, I launched the three-year ""Break the Silence | Against Family Violence"" campaign to renew and raise awareness of family violence. This campaign involves MSF collaborating with non-government organisations and corporate partners, to equip bystanders with resources and skills to safely step in to help victims. This is done through initiatives such as roving community roadshows and training sessions.No one should endure abuse in silence. All of us, as family members, friends and neighbours, can play a part to report abuse and seek help for those affected by violence."
suicides of migrant workers,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the number of suicides of migrant workers for each year in the past three years; and (b) what measures are there for early detection of mental illnesses amongst migrant workers.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: From 2014 to 2016, an average of 32 work permit holders, including foreign domestic workers, committed suicide each year. This translates into a suicide rate of 3.25 per 100,000 work permit holders. The suicide rate for the total population, including both residents and non-residents, was 7.54 per 100,000 people over the same period.All work permit holders go through a mandatory pre-employment medical examination before they start work in Singapore. The medical examination requires the doctor to perform a set of clinical examinations of various medical conditions, including a basic assessment of the mental state of the work permit holder.MOM actively reaches out to workers through education programmes, newsletters and guidebooks that cover issues such as mental well-being and managing stress. These include the Foreign Domestic Worker Settling in Programme (SIP) as well as the annual INFORM newsletter in the FDW’s native language. MOM Foreign Worker Ambassadors also reach out to foreign workers at their dormitories and workplaces. Avenues of help are communicated through these programmes as well as through collaterals like card sleeves which are issued to all foreign workers and foreign domestic workers when they receive their work permit. These include contacts of Non-Government Organisations (NGOs) like the Migrant Worker Centre and Centre for Domestic Employees which partner with organizations such as the Silver Ribbon to provide counselling services.We also need employers and workers to work together to be alert to any worker showing early signs of mental stress, and to refer them to organisations such as the Samaritans of Singapore, the Silver Ribbon, or medical professionals, so that they can receive timely help."
reducing mobile roaming charges across asean,Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for Communications and Information whether there has been progress in reducing mobile roaming charges across ASEAN to promote business and tourism.,"Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim: Tangible progress has been made in reducing roaming rates in the region in recent years, particularly for data roaming. Mobile operators in ASEAN, including our local operators, have introduced a number of innovative, transparent and affordable data roaming plans, such as daily unlimited data roaming packages. These plans typically charge lower rates than existing pay-as-you-use roaming services. For example, our local operators offer unlimited data roaming plans for mobile users who travel to popular ASEAN destinations like Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines for a flat rate of $15 to $19 a day. These are much more affordable than pay-as-you-use services. Over the past year, some operators have also expanded their offerings so that customers can use their data packages across several ASEAN countries.We believe that consumers and businesses will benefit from the various efforts to reduce roaming rates, and we will continue to do more. In November 2015, the ASEAN Ministers responsible for Telecommunications and Information Technology endorsed the proposal to develop an ASEAN Framework on International Mobile Roaming to lower international mobile roaming rates between member states.The Framework aims to collectively promote transparent and affordable international mobile roaming charges in the region. Singapore has been working with other ASEAN member states to develop this Framework, which is targeted for completion by next year.MCI and IMDA will continue to promote transparent and affordable mobile roaming services in ASEAN to enhance regional integration and benefit businesses and consumers in the region."
taxes on loose tobacco leaves and cigarette paper,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar asked the Minister for Finance whether sufficient tobacco taxes have been imposed on loose tobacco leaves and cigarette paper sold in many shops in Singapore.,"Mr Heng Swee Keat: Singapore adopts a multi-pronged strategy to reduce smoking prevalence. This includes restrictions on tobacco advertising, smoking prohibitions in public places, public education, provision of smoking cessation services and taxation on tobacco products.Among loose tobacco products, Ang Hoon is the most common. In 2013, the excise duty for Ang Hoon was raised by 25% from $239 to $299 per kilogram. Together with other tobacco control measures, tax increases have helped to discourage the consumption of loose tobacco products. From 2013 to 2016, the amount of loose tobacco products released for local consumption decreased by more than 30%.The Ministry of Finance will continue to work with the Ministry of Health to monitor international best practices in tobacco control and adopt appropriate measures to control tobacco use."
unpaid income tax of deceased persons,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Finance (a) for each year in the past three years, how much unpaid income tax from deceased persons is owed to IRAS; (b) how much of such unpaid income tax does it recover; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider writing off such unpaid taxes below a certain amount.","Mr Heng Swee Keat: I thank Mr Louis Ng for his question.Based on IRAS' records, the outstanding taxes due from deceased taxpayers amount to between $13 million and $20 million annually, for the past three years. Generally, about 80% of such unpaid taxes are recovered over time.IRAS' overall approach is to try and recover any unpaid taxes in the first instance. But after all appropriate recovery actions have been taken, IRAS will consider writing off the unpaid taxes."
harsher penalties for causing public nuisance and victimising vulnerable persons,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether the Ministry will consider reviewing the penalties for causing public nuisance and introduce heftier punishments for those who victimise vulnerable persons such as seniors, children and disabled persons; and (b) whether the Ministry will raise the fines for public nuisance offences and include community service as part of the punishment.","Mr K Shanmugam: Public nuisance offences typically involve acts that cause danger or annoyance to the public, obstruction to traffic in a public place, or disturbance of the public peace. Examples include intoxicated persons shouting vulgarities in public to the annoyance of the public, or minor scuffles. These acts may not necessarily have specific victims, but cause public nuisance more generally. Public nuisance carries a maximum penalty of $1,000 fine.In instances where hurt is caused or criminal force is used, the Penal Code prescribes harsher punishments. These are more serious offences, and imprisonment terms and community orders can be imposed. Where there are vulnerable victims such as children and the elderly, our courts will take this into consideration in the sentencing of offenders.There is therefore no need to review the penalties for public nuisance. Depending on the circumstances of each case, offenders who commit more serious acts can be subjected to harsher punishments under different offences. The offenders can also be subjected to community orders where appropriate."
opportunities for local businesses in one belt one road projects,Mr Zaqy Mohamad asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (a) what are the Ministry's plans to help local businesses exploit opportunities in the various One Belt One Road projects across Asia; and (b) what is the addressable market for local companies and what are the Ministry's targets in helping local firms engage in related Government-to-Government initiatives.,"Mr S Iswaran: The Belt and Road (B&R) initiative opens up opportunities for Singapore companies to partner the growing pool of Chinese companies venturing into various countries across Asia. The Government agencies are helping our companies prepare themselves for these opportunities by enhancing their capabilities, internationalisation efforts, and deepening their expertise in our region which is a key Belt & Road market. For example, Singapore companies can tap on IE Singapore’s enhanced Internationalisation Finance Scheme (IFS) and the new Global Ready Infrastructure Talent (GRIT) Programme, which provides companies with greater financing, risk-sharing and talent support as they undertake mid-to-large scale infrastructure projects in the region. IE Singapore has also recently launched the ""Go Southeast Asia"" Award to match high-potential final-year undergraduate students with Singapore companies and support their internships in Southeast Asia.ASEAN is a key B&R market for the internationalising Chinese companies. In 2016, Singapore was China’s largest overseas investment destination amongst countries within the B&R initiative, constituting 29% of China's total ODI in B&R countries1. Our local companies bring market knowledge of regional countries, and have complementary strengths in the areas of transport and logistics, utilities, mixed-used park development, construction and financing. A recent example of such collaboration is the joint venture between Surbana Jurong and the China Highway Engineering Consulting Corporation to pursue highway and infrastructure-related projects in the B&R countries.Within China, the Chongqing Connectivity Initiative (CCI) is a key priority and demonstration initiative that Singapore and China are collaborating on under the B&R. As part of this collaboration, IE Singapore actively introduces Singapore companies to partners and agencies in China to access opportunities in Chongqing and Western China across different industry sectors. The Chongqing Logistics Development Platform (CLDP)2 and the Multi-modal Distribution and Connectivity (DC) Centre3, both of which involve Singapore and Chinese companies, are examples of such projects and opportunities.Singapore has been an early supporter of China’s B&R initiative. In June 2015, we became one of the founding members of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). In November 2015, China and Singapore launched the Chongqing Connectivity Initiative, the third Government-to-Government project between Singapore and China. More recently, Singapore signed an MOU with China in May to bolster our collaboration on projects and opportunities arising from the B&R initiative. Through these efforts, our companies will have the opportunity to invest and participate in the B&R. IE Singapore will continue to connect Singapore companies with key Chinese and foreign companies to explore B&R ventures in China as well as in third-party markets through its network of overseas centres."
risks of smoking unfiltered tobacco leaves,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar asked the Minister for Health (a) whether sufficient awareness campaigns are carried out to educate the public on the risks of smoking unfiltered tobacco leaves and that the purchase of such tobacco products is the same as buying cigarettes; and (b) whether there is sufficient enforcement to ensure that shops selling such products must also abide by the same laws governing the sale of cigarettes to those below 21 years old.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: We have adopted a multi-pronged approach to reduce the consumption of tobacco. To ensure that the public is aware of the harms of smoking, graphic health warnings have been mandated on all tobacco products. With effect from 1 August 2017, the point-of-sale display ban will also come into force for all tobacco products.The Health Promotion Board (HPB)'s I Quit Campaign supports smokers to quit by working with community partners and employers to organise roadshows encouraging smokers to sign-up for the I Quit 28-Day Countdown smoking cessation programme. Smokers can also call the HPB’s Quitline or access online resources for help to quit. In 2016, these programmes reached more than 16,000 smokers, including those who use loose tobacco leaves. For the youths, HPB works with the Ministry of Education and Institutes of Higher Learning to incorporate anti-tobacco messages into the curriculum and co-curricular activities, thereby raise awareness about the benefits of a tobacco-free lifestyle, informing youths on the harms of smoking, and teaching how to refuse offers to smoke. In addition, Student Health Advisors are deployed to some schools to address health issues including supporting youths to quit tobacco use. Our outreach efforts have reached out to about 50,000 students in 2016.Laws governing tobacco sales to under-aged persons are consistently enforced regardless of tobacco product type. The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) conducts educational initiatives and regular enforcement to help retailers comply with the law and takes stern action on errant retailers who do not. In 2016, a total of 30 retailers were caught selling tobacco to under-aged youths. Any person who sells tobacco to an under-aged person is liable upon conviction, to a maximum fine of $5,000 for the first offence and $10,000 for subsequent offences. Retailers caught selling tobacco to under-aged persons are also liable have their tobacco retail licence suspended or revoked.Among non-cigarette tobacco products, Ang Hoon, a kind of unfiltered tobacco product, is the most common. Ang Hoon and other loose tobacco leaves products made up 1.7% of all tobacco products imported for local consumption in 2016.Although the import of Ang Hoon has been declining in Singapore over the years, there are concerns overseas that the use of roll-your-own tobacco products may be on the rise among youths due to their lower prices and the misperception that they are less harmful than manufactured cigarettes. In fact, unfiltered tobacco products like Ang Hoon are just as harmful to health as cigarettes.To prevent an increase in smoking of Ang Hoon among youths here due to a misperception that it is less harmful, we will include relevant messages in our education campaigns to dispel such misconceptions. We will also continue to ensure that the law against tobacco sales to minors is enforced across all categories of tobacco products."
industry readiness of our graduates,Mr Zaqy Mohamad asked the Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) in light of our Universities attaining high global rankings (a) whether employers from industries have found our graduates to be more industry ready; and (b) whether the level of satisfaction among students on the quality of teaching have also improved over the past five years.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: I agree with the Member that it is important for our Autonomous Universities (AUs) to teach their students well, to ensure that their graduates are industry-ready. The AUs pay close attention to teaching quality and industry outcomes.On teaching quality, our AUs administer regular surveys to collect timely feedback. Data from these surveys are used to review curriculum and evaluate the teaching contributions of faculty members. Student feedback on teaching has been consistently positive across the AUs. A key factor for consideration in the appraisal of faculty members is their teaching performance.In addition, in the area of curriculum design, the AUs constantly engage and collaborate with industry partners to keep their course content relevant. Compulsory internship and industry project components within the curriculum give students opportunities to strike a balance between theory and practice, academic knowledge and skills, and enhance their work readiness.As for industry outcomes, the best affirmation is the employability of graduates. That is also why the AUs conduct annual Graduate Employment Surveys. Over the past five years, the surveys have reflected good employment outcomes of our local graduates, with around nine in ten university graduates in the labour force securing jobs within six months after completing their final examinations. Their gross median salaries have also increased over the years.Global rankings do take some of these considerations into account. For example, the Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) World University Rankings surveys the universities’ reputation amongst employers. The Times Higher Education rankings surveys academics evaluation of teaching quality. These are useful, but we need to be clear that they are neither adequate nor fully reflective of the priorities of AUs and the full economic and social mission of the AUs.Hence, MOE’s longstanding position is that global rankings is only a reference. There are many important aspects of a university education, including teaching quality, industry relevance, employment outcome, and development of innovation and enterprise, that are not well captured in global ranking methodologies. Members of the House can be assured that MOE will look way beyond international rankings to ensure that teaching quality and work readiness remain high."
counter-terrorism training for event organisers,"Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether the Ministry will organise compulsory training on counter-terrorism for event organisers, emcees and hosts so that they will be equipped with the knowhow to deter and prevent terror attacks; and (b) whether the Ministry will stipulate that evacuation routes and dispersal instructions be made known by the organisers at the start of large-scale events.","Mr K Shanmugam: Event organisers generally engage licensed security agencies and security officers for large events. These security professionals are trained in event security and crowd-management.To raise awareness among event companies and freelancers, which includes hosts and emcees, MHA supported a Counter-Terrorism Seminar organised by the Singapore Talent, Artistes and Resources Association in May this year. The seminar was attended by 180 event companies and freelancers. Seminar participants were briefed on the security threat situation, and advised on how they could deal with an attack and recover quickly in the aftermath. MHA is also working with MOM and key associations in the entertainment industry to prepare industry practitioners to respond to emergency situations.The Police also work closely with event organisers to ensure the security of large events. The Public Order Act was amended in April to require events that attract large crowds, or are of higher-risk, to put in place necessary security measures. The Police will also be issuing guidelines on event security best practices as a reference for all event organisers and security companies.Evacuation plans are essential for any large-scale event. For large events designated under the Public Order Act, Police will require organisers to inform participants about the evacuation routes where practicable.Beyond Government regulations and security agencies, members of the public can also play their part. This is why we started the SGSecure movement. Everyone should stay alert to security threats, pick up relevant knowledge and skills – such as our 'Run, Hide, Tell' advisory and know what to do if one is caught in an attack while attending a large-scale event."
lift trials and lift upgrading programme in bedok and sengkang south,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development what is the status of the feasibility study on lift pilot trials to provide lift access to blocks in Bedok.,"33 Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development when will the Lift Upgrading Programme be carried out for the rest of the HDB flats in Sengkang South.Mr Lawrence Wong: The Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP) was launched in 2001 to provide direct lift access to flats and enhance convenience for residents, especially the elderly and the less mobile. At the start of the programme, there were more than 5,300 HDB blocks without 100% lift access. Among them, more than 1,000 blocks were initially found to be unfeasible for LUP due to cost or technical constraints.Over the years, HDB has adopted innovative technical solutions and conducted lift pilot trials to help flats in these affected blocks achieve direct lift access. Some examples of solutions that have been successfully implemented include lifts that do not have a machine room at the top of the shafts (i.e., machine room-less lifts), creation of new entry points to residents' homes, and the use of smaller ""home lifts"" such as those used in the Bedok blocks which the Member referred to.More recently, HDB piloted new solutions like the Pneumatic Vacuum Elevator at Lorong 6 Toa Payoh and the Vertical Platform Lift at Petir Road, but both were found to be unfeasible.Through the various innovative solutions, the vast majority of the 5,300 blocks have benefitted from LUP. There now remains about 150 blocks where it is still not possible to implement LUP due to existing constraints or prohibitive costs. This includes 17 blocks in Sengkang South. Residents who are in urgent need of direct lift access due to medical conditions or disability may approach HDB for housing and financing assistance. HDB assesses each request on a case-by-case basis to see how best to render help."
protection of consumers' interests in private hire car market,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling asked the Minister for Transport (a) to what extent will the new rule of affixing private hire car (PHC) decals on private chauffeured cars protect consumers' interest; (b) whether the PHC companies should be the responsible party of providing all registered drivers and their car details to LTA; and (c) whether there are other enforceable alternatives to protect consumers besides a permanently affixed car decal.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Tamper-evident decals help commuters more easily verify that the private hire cars they engage are indeed registered with LTA. It also facilitates enforcement against offences such as using unregistered cars to provide private hire car services, or private hire cars picking up passengers via street-hail. Together with vocational licensing, this ensures accountability when providing private hire car services.We had considered alternatives, such as special licence plates for private hire cars. Tamper-evident decals, however, provide more flexibility. They can be easily removed if necessary, such as when driving the car into Malaysia for personal use, but the owner must get a new decal affixed subsequently. Decals are also less onerous to implement for the owners.Private hire car owners are not required to submit details of their registered drivers to LTA on a regular basis, but must maintain a register of persons who drive their cars and produce this when requested by LTA. Private hire car booking service operators such as Uber and Grab will be subject to similar requirements later this year."
complaints against multi-level marketing companies,"Mr Ang Wei Neng asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (a) apart from insurance companies, how many companies in Singapore are currently operating using the multi-level marketing (MLM) model; (b) whether the current laws and regulations governing MLM are sufficient; and (c) how many complaints have been received on the practice of MLM in the past five years.","Mr S Iswaran: Under the Multi-Level Marketing and Pyramid Selling (Prohibition) Act (MLM Act), it is unlawful to promote or participate in a MLM scheme or arrangement; or register a business designed to promote MLM schemes or arrangements. However, not all multi-level marketing activities are prohibited under the Act. The Exclusion Order specifies the schemes which are excluded from the MLM Act such as insurance businesses, which are licensed under the Insurance Act; and master franchise schemes and direct selling schemes which fulfil certain conditions. Companies do not require a special license to operate using MLM techniques. As such, we do not have a record of the number of companies operating using MLM techniques.Over the past five years, CASE has received on average less than 10 complaints a year relating to MLM schemes, compared to the average annual total of 24,000 complaints received. Hence, there are no plans to review the current laws on MLM activities.We urge members of the public to exercise due diligence when deciding whether to participate in business schemes, particularly those which offer get-rich-quick promises. Should members of the public suspect that certain activities are illegal MLM schemes, they should make a report to the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD)."
emergency preparedness courses in schools,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether there are plans to work with schools to make emergency preparedness, including basic first aid skills, mandatory for students, with the goal of CPR/AED certification at secondary school level.","Mr K Shanmugam: As part of the SGSecure movement, MHA is working with MOE to equip students with emergency preparedness skills through the ""Dispatcher-Assisted first Responder"" (DARE) programme.The DARE programme was introduced at 15 secondary schools last year. A total of 3,000 lower secondary students were taught to perform CPR and how to use the AED during their PE lessons. Following this pilot, CPR and use of AED will be taught to all Secondary One students as part of the PE curriculum from the fourth quarter of this year. Drills and exercises are also conducted by schools to equip students with emergency preparedness skills.MOE has also incorporated emergency preparedness lessons in its curriculum for Primary 5 and 6 students. Students learn simple first aid such as treating minor cuts, burns and nosebleeds, and how to recognise and manage general injuries related to sports and physical activity. Students also learn basic fire safety, such as how to identify possible fire hazards and to stay low when trapped in a smoke-filled room."
child booster seats in private hire cars,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the child booster seat sufficiently serves as a safety measure in private hire cars for children below six years old; and (b) how does the rule differ in this aspect between cars used for personal usage as compared to those on private hire service.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The Traffic Police requires any passenger below 1.35 metres in height to be properly secured by a child restraint appropriate for his or her height and weight. In this regard, a simple booster seat might not adequately secure a very young or short passenger, say, a child who is only one to two years old. A baby seat would be more appropriate. Using the appropriate child restraint reduces the chances of serious or even fatal injuries in an accident.The rule applies equally to both private cars and private hire cars."
applications and assessment for private hire car driver's vocational licence,Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the number of applications for the Private Hire Car Driver's Vocational Licence (PDVL) that the LTA has received to date; (b) how many of these applicants failed the security and background checks; and (c) how many of these applicants are already providing private hire car services under the former regulations and what are the main reasons for their failure to obtain the PDVL under the new regulations.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: As of 28 June 2017, LTA has received about 43,000 applications for the Private Hire Car Driver’s Vocational Licence (PDVL). 42,000 applications or 98% have been processed. Of these, 38,000 have been approved. 450 have been rejected because of failed background checks. The rest were rejected because they were invalid, for example, the applicant did not have the minimum two years’ Class 3/3A driving experience. We do not have data if the current applicants are already providing private hire car services."
comprehensive background checks and screening of auxiliary police officers,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether our auxiliary police force has a process in place for proper and comprehensive background checks to screen potential and current auxiliary police officers for activities that may compromise their integrity as auxiliary police officers.,"Mr K Shanmugam: All Auxiliary Police Officers (APOs) are screened by the Police to assess whether they are suitable to be employed for security work, which includes a person's criminal records. For operational security reasons, we cannot disclose further details.In addition, the Auxiliary Police Forces (APFs) also set stringent selection criteria for the appointment of all APOs. They must have a minimum education of GCE 'N' level, or equivalent. They also need to be physically fit to be able to fulfil the requirements for their jobs. The APFs interview their candidates to ensure they have the right attitude and temperament for the job. During the APOs' employment, screening is carried out and the APFs also actively observe and assess their performance and conduct.Despite our best efforts, it is not possible for the authorities or the APFs to detect APOs' errant intentions or behaviour in every case. Relatives, colleagues, friends and the community must also play their part to alert the authorities early when they come to know of such activities."
lessons for singapore from fire tragedy at grenfell tower in london,"Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what preliminary lessons can be learned from the fire tragedy at Grenfell Tower in London that occurred on 14 June 2017; and (b) what measures have been or will be put in place to reduce the risk of a rapid and lethal fire in high-rise buildings in Singapore, particularly those built in the 1970s and 1980s.","Note: Notices of related Parliamentary Questions by Mr Saktiandi Supaat, Mr Zainal Sapari and Ms Sun Xueling for later sittings were subsequently withdrawn.Mr K Shanmugam: I will respond to Ms Lim’s questions. But as Mr Saktiandi Supaat, Mr Zainal Sapari and Ms Sun Xueling have also asked related PQs for subsequent sittings, I will take the chance to address them holistically in our response.The fire at Grenfell Tower in London highlights the importance of robust fire prevention and protection measures in safeguarding lives and property.Mr Saktiandi Supaat and Ms Sun Xueling have raised concerns about the safety of building construction materials, including the use of claddings. Claddings are typically used on the external walls of buildings for weather protection or aesthetic purposes. Under the Fire Code, all claddings that are used in buildings have to meet the stringent Class ‘0’ industry standard such that when ignited, the fire will not spread along the surface.When the London Fire Brigade releases its investigation report on the Grenfell Tower fire, SCDF will study these findings and assess if there is a need to make changes to fire safety regulations in Singapore.SCDF has in place a regime that seeks to ensure that fire safety works comply with regulations. The registered architect or professional engineer, also known as the Qualified Person or QP for short, is responsible for ensuring that building materials conform to the prevailing Fire Code. In addition, an independent Registered Inspector will have to inspect the building to ensure that all fire safety requirements have been met. It is only after this is done that SCDF will issue a Fire Safety Certificate, allowing the premises to be used or occupied.Carrying out or allowing unauthorised fire safety works is an offence under the Fire Safety Act and building owners can be fined up to $200,000, or face an imprisonment term of up to 2 years, or both. SCDF will also take action against the registered professionals if they fail to carry out their duties properly.Ms Sylvia Lim asked about fire safety measures for high-rise buildings. Under the Fire Code, all buildings are required to put in place fire safety provisions such as fire hose reels, exit staircases, and emergency lightings.All high-rise buildings are required to have additional fire safety provisions such as fire lifts. SCDF defines high-rise buildings as those that are above 24 metres in height, which is about 8 to 10 storeys tall. This is similar to the definition used by the United States’ National Fire Protection Association.Super high-rise residential buildings that exceed 40 storeys in height require at least one refuge floor for every 20 storeys. These refuge floors have to be fire resistant for at least two hours and serve as a temporary holding space for evacuees during a fire incident while the firefighters put out the fire.SCDF conducts weekly fire-fighting and rescue exercises for high-rise non-residential buildings, in addition to other exercises at different locations throughout the year. The simulated scenarios allow SCDF officers to familiarise themselves with the various high-rise premises, as well as to validate response plans and procedures.Ms Sylvia Lim also asked about SCDF’s plans to ensure occupant safety in older high-rise buildings. SCDF strictly enforces the Fire Code, and carries out regular reviews to ensure that the standard of fire safety in buildings keep pace with developments in the building industry and technological advancements in fire protection systems. SCDF also issues circulars to the industry on amendments to the Fire Code pertaining to new fire safety requirements.Claddings were not commonly used till the 1980s. Notwithstanding this, since the introduction of the Fire Code in 1974, all buildings have been required to only use claddings of Class ‘0’ standard. All old buildings built with non-compliant cladding would have to comply with the prevailing Fire Code once they carried out alterations and additions works. All HDB residential blocks built in the 1970s also do not use such claddings. In addition, the construction and upgrading works of all HDB residential blocks would have to comply with prevailing fire safety requirements.Nonetheless, for old buildings that were constructed before 1974 and have not undergone any upgrading works over the years which would have required them to meet prevailing fire safety requirements, MHA and SCDF are reviewing legislative amendments to require some of these old buildings to perform fire safety upgrades. In doing so, we will adopt a balanced, risk-based approach.Beyond fire safety regulations, Mr Zainal Sapari and Ms Sun Xueling also asked about evacuation procedures for residential buildings. SCDF has stipulated robust fire safety measures for residential buildings. Every residential unit is designed as a fire compartment, and required by the Fire Code to be equipped with fire-rated entrance doors, walls and floors that help to prevent the spread of fire beyond the unit.As opposed to large non-residential buildings such as shopping centres and offices, residents would be familiar with the layout of their own homes and buildings. Hence, the carrying out of fire drills is not mandatory for residential buildings. In the event of a fire, residents should close the door of the affected room to contain the fire and evacuate to safety.When SCDF arrives at the scene, SCDF will prioritise evacuation of occupants on the floors affected by fire, as well as those on the two floors above floors affected. If necessary, SCDF may proceed with subsequent evacuation of occupants on additional floors of the building. Residents in unaffected floors will be advised to stay in their respective units, each of which is a fire compartment. Such an approach will minimise injuries or mishaps resulting from the evacuation process.SCDF actively engages the community to raise their awareness on fire safety procedures, through platforms such as Emergency Preparedness block parties and Emergency Preparedness Days organised across various heartland communities. At such events, residents are taught how to evacuate from a smoke-logged room and extinguish small household fires. We urge everyone to actively participate in such events, to pick up important basic fire safety skills.For businesses, SCDF and the National Fire and Civil Emergency Preparedness Council (NFEC) have been organising various fire safety workshops and seminars for members of the Company Emergency Response Team (CERT), security officers, employees and trade associations. During these seminars, participants learn about good fire safety practices and also receive practical tips on emergency response skills.Singapore has a high standard of fire safety. The number of fire fatalities per 100,000 population is among the lowest in the world.1 This is because we take a multi- pronged approach to fire safety. But every single fatality is simply one too many. Therefore, SCDF strictly enforces, and constantly reviews, the Fire Code to ensure the safety of occupants in buildings, as well as conducts outreach and education efforts so that our citizens are well prepared to respond in the event of a fire.But we cannot afford to be complacent, because everyone has a part to play in ensuring fire safety. From time to time, SCDF uncovers fires that start or spread due to building owners or occupants breaching the Fire Code, such as failing to maintain fire-fighting equipment or ensuring that exits are not obstructed. SCDF will take firm action in such instances. In some cases, fires were also caused by carelessness, such as unattended cooking in households. In recent years, SCDF has also seen an increase in the number of fires involving the charging of batteries of electric bicycles and personal mobility devices such as hoverboards. Users of such products should use only approved power adaptors that carry the SAFETY Mark, and follow the manufacturer’s instructions on how to charge the devices properly. We have also heard anecdotal stories of building owners and occupants taking fire evacuation drills lightly.SCDF will do its part and take its regulatory and fire-fighting responsibilities seriously, but so should all of us."
lease extensions for older residents in lorong 3 geylang homes,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Law whether the Government will allow older residents at Lorong 3 Geylang whose home leases will expire in less than five years to extend their lease or provide rehousing assistance to this group of residents.,"Mr K Shanmugam: There are 191 private terrace houses at Lorong 3 Geylang. They sit on land parcels that are on 60-year leases. The 60 years will expire on 31 December 2020.On 20 June 2017, the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) announced that the land occupied by these 191 private terrace houses will return to the State when the current leases expire. The land is slated for future public housing. As a general policy, leasehold land will return to the State when the lease expires. This allows the land to be rejuvenated to meet the new social and economic needs of Singaporeans.The SLA is committed to helping owners, especially those still occupying their units, through the lease expiry process. Each owner has been assigned a dedicated SLA officer, who will help guide them through the process over the next three-and-a-half years.On 20 June 2017, SLA officers went house to house to introduce the dedicated officers and hand out a set of Frequently Asked Questions. SLA has also scheduled a personal session with each household to directly answer their questions, and this will take place over the next two months. Owners who need help in the transition can approach their assigned officer.Most of the current owners of the 191 units have moved out, and are letting out their units to foreign workers and other occupants who use them for religious activities. Based on agencies’ records, only 33 units are still occupied by their owners. They have various options, if they do not already have alternative housing. They can buy an HDB flat or private property, rent on the open market or live with their family members. For elderly owner-occupants, there are also existing schemes which will help them in their transition, including the short-lease 2-Room Flexi flats.During the personal sessions with the owners, SLA will check with them on their relocation plans and explain the various options available for those who require rehousing. For those who plan to buy an HDB flat, SLA will liaise with HDB and help with their applications.HDB plans to launch 14 Build-to-Order (BTO) exercises between now and December 2020. In addition, HDB will also launch during this period seven Sale of Balance Flats (SBF) exercises, where the units are completed or near completion. Eligible households have many options and time to book an HDB flat before their leases expire, especially if they apply for a BTO flat in the non-mature estates.For those who face financial difficulties and have no other housing options, SLA will work with HDB to help in their application for a public rental flat. There is sufficient time for the owners to apply for the public rental flat.For the owners who face difficulty transitioning to public housing due to existing rules/ policies, they may let their dedicated SLA case officer know. HDB is prepared to exercise flexibility for Singaporean households who require assistance. They will not be left without options."
update on telepharmacy project,Mr Seah Kian Peng asked the Minister for Health what is the outcome of the tele-pharmacy project first piloted in 1997 and whether such services including that of allowing medical consultations by video can help to lower costs and improve convenience to the public.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Telepharmacy can improve productivity and convenience for customers. It is regulated by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA), to ensure that providers put in place the necessary controls and safeguards.Since the first pilot in 1997, MOH and HSA have expanded the scope of telepharmacy services. For example, pharmacies were allowed in 2009 to provide prescription-only medicines through telepharmacy. Previously, this was only allowed for non-prescription medicines.To-date, 146 retail pharmacy outlets are offering telepharmacy services. These include outlets at the three largest retail pharmacy chains, namely Guardian Pharmacy, Unity Pharmacy and Watsons.In April 2017, MOH launched a Smart Health Video Consultation platform to enable our public healthcare institutions to provide different services through video consultation. These include a new model of telepharmacy service at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital and Tan Tock Seng Hospital.HSA will continue to review the regulations for telepharmacy services to keep up with technological changes and provide better service to patients. We also welcome opportunities to collaborate with care providers and retail pharmacies to co-create new solutions in this area."
government's benchmark for annualised real rate of return for gic and temasek holdings,Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for Finance what is the benchmark set by the Government's investment mandate for the annualised 20-year real rate of return for GIC and Temasek Holdings.,"Mr Heng Swee Keat: The Government’s assessment of the long-term performance of GIC and Temasek goes beyond using one single benchmark. The Government takes into account a number of factors including the entities’ distinct roles, risk exposure and underlying market and investment trends to make a considered and comprehensive assessment of the entities’ performance. Let me elaborate, starting with GIC.GIC is the Government’s fund manager. Its mandate is to achieve good long-term returns above global inflation, to preserve and enhance the international purchasing power of Singapore’s reserves.GIC invests in a globally diversified portfolio spread across various assets classes. Its portfolio is constructed to take into account a range of possible economic scenarios.The construction of GIC’s portfolio is subject to the Government’s risk preference, which is expressed through a Reference Portfolio made up of 65% global equities and 35% global bonds. This is not a benchmark, but an expression of the risk that Government is prepared for GIC to take in its long-term investment strategies.On occasion, there may be a difference between the risk exposure of GIC and the reference portfolio. Such an adjustment allows GIC to lower its risk exposure, in times of market exuberance. Conversely, GIC may also increase its risk exposure when the opportunity arises. This is part of a disciplined, professional approach to long term value investing. In recent years GIC has been concerned with heightened-valuations in financial markets and has shifted towards a slightly more conservative portfolio mix to guard against rising volatility.Therefore, we evaluate GIC’s long-term investment performance, not only based on its rolling 20-year rates of return, but also the risk it has had to take in order to achieve these returns. Such comparisons are available in GIC’s annual report.Let me now move on to Temasek. Temasek is not a fund manager, but an investment company that owns its assets. It is an active equity investor that seeks to create and deliver sustainable long-term value for its shareholder, the Government.One measure that the Government looks at is Temasek’s long term Total Shareholder Returns or TSR, which measures annual changes to its net portfolio value after adjusting for any capital injections or dividends paid. The TSR must be viewed in the context of Temasek’s risk-adjusted hurdle rate, which is a weighted average of the risk-adjusted cost of capital of all its investments. Temasek’s risk-adjusted hurdle rate is published in its annual report.The Government also compares Temasek’s long term TSR with various market indices, such as the MSCI, taking into consideration its portfolio mix.To sum up, the Government’s approach is to evaluate the entities’ long-term performance, taking into account risk exposure, underlying market trends, and other factors relevant to each entity.Our view is that our investment entities have performed creditably in challenging market conditions. The Government will continue to take a long term view and work closely with GIC and Temasek to ensure that they deliver good long-term returns for Singaporeans."
safeguards against possibility of terrorist attack using a vehicle,Mr Darryl David asked the Minister for Home Affairs what measures and precautions can be taken to safeguard public areas that have significant congregations of people from the possibility of a terrorist attack using a vehicle.,"Mr K Shanmugam: Protecting the public against terrorist attacks that use vehicles is a challenge that security agencies around the world are dealing with.Over the past year, the Home Team has enhanced our capabilities to prevent and respond to a terror attack. Our response forces are better equipped and organised. We have conducted major counter-terrorism exercises to test our response measures. We have also improved our surveillance and analytics capabilities. We will continue with these efforts.We recognise that it may not be possible to completely prevent a terrorist attack from happening in Singapore. Individuals who are determined to launch a terror attack can do so even without access to controlled items such as arms and explosives. The Westminster attack in London was executed with a normal saloon car.Thus, we are also expanding our efforts to engage the community through SGSecure. This will ensure our society is alert to and prepared for any attack and able to bounce back quickly after an attack.Specific to the threat of attacks using a vehicle, the public can play an important role by being vigilant near roads in crowded areas. They can save lives by alerting people nearby if they witness vehicles driving unusually, and contacting the Police if they notice suspicious persons or vehicles.We are also amending the law to ensure business owners of events and buildings take steps to protect them against terror attacks, including those which use vehicles.The Public Order Act was amended last month to require organisers of events that attract large crowds, or are of higher-risk, to put necessary security measures in place. To prevent vehicle-borne threats, organisers may be asked to install physical barriers, screen incoming vehicles, or plan crowded events away from areas that vehicles can access.For example, for major events involving large crowds such as the Marina Bay Singapore Countdown, Police will work with various stakeholders to put in place security measures to prevent vehicle attacks. Some of these measures include checks on vehicles seeking entry into the event area, road closures, creating buffer zones between spectators and active roads, as well as installing barriers.We will also introduce a new Infrastructure Protection Act later this year. This will require new, large-scale developments to incorporate security measures when they are being designed. These may also include measures against vehicle-borne threats. The Act may also require owners of premises to adopt additional protective measures, such as bag or vehicle checks, in the event of a heightened security climate.These legislative amendments will help protect Singapore against terror attacks by improving security at key events and buildings. They complement MHA’s ongoing efforts to improve security response as well as community vigilance and preparedness against terrorism threats."
waiver of accrued interest on resale levy of hdb flats,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development (a) in the past five years, how many appeals have been received by HDB on waiver of accrued interest on the resale levy of HDB flats; (b) whether HDB will assist second-time buyers of HDB flats with the large amounts of accrued interest on the resale levy; and (c) what is the assistance rendered by HDB to these appellants.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Singaporeans enjoy a significant housing subsidy when they buy a new flat from HDB, or a resale flat in the open market with a CPF housing grant. They can also buy a second new flat from HDB, but as second-timers, they are no longer eligible for the full subsidy which is meant for first-timers only. Hence the resale levy is imposed on all second-time buyers of HDB flats.Under the current resale levy policy which has been in place since March 2006, second-timers pay the resale levy upon the sale of the first subsidised flat or the collection of keys to the second flat, whichever is the later. There is no interest component.However, we recognise that there are some second-timers who had sold their first HDB flat before 2006. Under the prevailing policy then, they were subject to a compound interest of 5% per annum if they chose to defer the payment of the levy until they collect keys to their second subsidised flat. Some of them are now looking to purchase a second flat from HDB, but face high interest on their resale levy accumulated over the years.HDB does not track the number of appeals it has received specifically for a waiver of the accrued interest on the resale levy. However, for appeals to reduce the resale levy payable in general, HDB received about 4,200 appeals from 2012 to 2016, and acceded to 1,729 appeals.In 2015, we waived the accrued interest on the resale levy payable by elderly second-timers who wished to right-size to a smaller flat. Beyond the elderly, HDB has also been exercising flexibility for other affected second-timers who are in need, and will continue to do so. Those who require assistance, such as households who face financial difficulties or wish to right-size to a smaller flat, can approach HDB, and we will see how best to help them."
potential for rental vehicles to be used in terrorist attacks,"Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Home Affairs in light of recent terrorist attacks whereby rental vehicles have been used, whether the Ministry will consider (i) tightening checks on the identity of persons renting vehicles (ii) establishing information-sharing with vehicle rental companies and (iii) educating employees of vehicle rental companies on identifying suspicious persons renting vehicles so as to minimise the risk of potential terrorist attacks in Singapore.","Mr K Shanmugam: Countering vehicular terrorist attacks is a challenge that security agencies around the world have to plan for.MHA is working to enhance timely information sharing between private hire car owners such as vehicle rental companies and the Police, including information on the identity of persons renting vehicles.However, checks on the identity alone will not prevent vehicles from being used for criminal purposes, or in terrorist attacks. For example, an unattended vehicle could be stolen and used by persons with ill-intent. The perpetrator can also ask someone else to rent a vehicle. As such, drivers, especially heavy vehicle drivers, and members of the public will also need to be vigilant against such a threat.Police have engaged the Vehicle Rental Association of Singapore (VRAS) on these risks, and will continue to reach out to more vehicle rental companies and heavy vehicle companies under the SGSecure movement. Police will share useful tips and lessons with these companies and their staff on how to prevent their vehicles from being used to commit crime or acts of terror. These include, to- Secure the premises where vehicles are stored to prevent unauthorised entry, through measures such as perimeter fencing.- Remind drivers that they should never leave their vehicles, together with their keys, unattended.- Notify the Police immediately if they notice anything suspicious about the drivers, or if vehicles are missing or stolen."
students identified by counsellors or teachers to be vulnerable to extremist propaganda,"Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for Education (Schools) (a) in the past two years, how many students have been identified by counsellors or teachers to be vulnerable to extremist propaganda; (b) what action has been taken to help these students; and (c) whether there are plans to reach out to students to forewarn them of the pitfalls of online radicalism.","Mr Ng Chee Meng: The Ministry of Education (MOE) works closely with the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) to strengthen and safeguard Singapore’s social fabric against the serious threats of radicalisation and extremism.In schools, teachers and counsellors look out for students who show signs of possible influence of extremist propaganda. If there are concerns, we would take a precautionary approach and work closely with MHA to provide counselling support and ensure close monitoring of such students.MOE seeks to educate students to be sensitive and socially responsible on racial and religious matters through the school curriculum in Social Studies and Character and Citizenship Education lessons. In schools, cyber wellness education helps students to be more discerning and aware of the negative influences of online information, and to make more informed and responsible decisions. Students are equipped with information literacy to verify the credibility of online content and information sources. Parents also play a crucial role in guiding and monitoring their children’s online activities to ensure that their children adopt the right values and attitudes.All of us have a part to play in keeping radicalisation at bay. Schools and teachers work in partnership with parents and the wider community to instil the right values in students, and to ensure that those vulnerable to the influence of extremist propaganda are detected early and given proper guidance and help."
impact of gic's divestment in ubs on rate of return for government's investment portfolio,Mr Png Eng Huat asked ask the Minister for Finance what is the impact of GIC's reduced stake in UBS on the performance of the Government's investment portfolio in terms of annualised rate of return for five-year and ten-year time periods respectively and how much is the realised loss of the UBS divestment.,"Mr Heng Swee Keat: GIC’s performance over five- and 10-year periods are published annually by GIC on its website. These figures reflect in aggregate, both realised and unrealised gains and losses of all investments, including UBS. Hence, the reduction of GIC’s stake in UBS does not in itself change these figures. It only changed unrealised losses, which were already reflected in the performance figures, to realised losses.Mr Png had asked what the realised loss of the UBS divestment was. It is not the Government’s policy to discuss details of specific investment transactions. I would like to reiterate that the investment performance of GIC should not be evaluated based on any single transaction. Rather, the Government’s focus is on GIC’s performance on an overall portfolio basis, over the long term. While it is disappointing that the UBS deal did not turn out as expected, investing is about taking calculated risks in anticipation of returns. Some returns may materialise, some may not. It is not realistic to avoid any loss for every investment as that would require GIC to be completely risk averse.What is more important and relevant is that the overall portfolio delivers creditable long term returns over and above inflation. As at 31 March 2016, GIC achieved a 20-year annualised rate of return of 4% above global inflation ? this includes the investment in UBS."
"schools counselling for students on ""performance-enhancement"" substances","Mr Darryl David asked the Minister for Education (Schools) what steps are taken by schools and tertiary institutions to counsel their students with regard to the taking of pharmaceutical products containing modafinil or methylphenidate which are perceived as ""performance-enhancement"" substances.","Mr Ng Chee Meng: Our schools and Post-Secondary Education Institutions (PSEIs) will step up efforts to educate students on the side effects of ""performance-enhancement"" substances and remind them of possible consequences and the need to make responsible decisions.Our teachers also work with their students to manage their expectations with respect to their performance in schools. They help students with their goal setting process, where they set appropriate targets and determine actions to achieve them based on sound values. At PSEIs, counsellors are also trained to explore positive strategies with students to manage their school performance.With our current emphasis on peer support, groups of students are equipped to watch out for their classmates and friends and help those they notice have unhealthy behaviours to think through their decisions responsibly and to seek help or alert a trusted adult.Schools also work closely with parents to identify students who may be misusing such substances and refer them for counselling or other additional support."
complaints by residents for hdb flats legally rented out by homeowners,"Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for National Development (a) over the last two years, what has been the number of complaints made by residents on HDB homes that have been legally rented out by homeowners; and (b) whether HDB can consider disallowing these units from being rented out when the landlords are unable to address the issues complained of.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Over the last two years, there has been about 600 feedback received each year on alleged nuisance by the subtenants of HDB flats. This is a small percentage of about 1% of the 53,000 flats rented out as of end December 2016.One of the common feedback received is on noise nuisance. For such cases, HDB will inform flat owners of the complaint and advise them to remind their subtenants to be considerate. In most cases, the flat owners will resolve the matter quickly. If the situation does not improve, flat owners can consider mediation with the neighbour who complained, avail themselves of the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals, or end the subletting arrangement."
proposal for hdb rents to be based on per capita income,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry will consider charging rentals under HDB's Public Rental Scheme based on per capita income instead of the household income.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB’s public rental rates are calibrated to provide subsidies where they are most needed and to encourage rental households to purchase home ownership flats when they are ready. More than half of HDB’s rental households pay basic rents, which are now set at $26 a month for a 1-room flat and $44 a month for a 2-room flat. The remaining households pay higher monthly rents based on their household incomes. The majority of HDB rental tenants have a household size of three or less.However, HDB recognises that some households do face difficulties paying higher rents, for example due to medical needs or a large number of dependents. This is why HDB already exercises flexibility to allow tenants to pay a lower rent depending on each household’s circumstances."
incidence of late payment of employer cpf contributions,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the reason for the 69% increase in CPF arrears due to late payment from 2014 to 2016; (b) what penalties have been imposed on employers for late payment of CPF contributions; and (c) whether the education and deterrence components of CPF Board's approach to ensure timely payment of CPF contributions need to be enhanced.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: The amount of CPF contributions recovered for employees due to late payment increased from $364.2 million in 2014 to $615.4 million in 2016. Over the same period, total CPF contributions also increased from $29.7 billion in 2014 to $35.9 billion in 2016. Therefore, as a percentage of total CPF contributions, late payments were 1.23% in 2014, and 1.72% in 2016. Reasons cited by employers for late payment include cashflow issues due to a difficult business environment and delays in collecting payments from customers, as well as errors made by the employers.While there has been an increase in the number of late payments in recent years, CPF Board takes timely enforcement actions and imposes deterrent penalties to ensure speedy recovery of late payments. The percentage of employers who have not made good their late payments within one month after the expiry of the grace period for paying CPF contributions2 fell from 3.0% in 2014 to 1.6% in 2016.Employers who make late payments have to make good the CPF contribution owing to employees, including a late payment interest charge of 18% per annum. Employers are also given composition fines provided they pay up before their court hearing. Those who fail to pay up by the court hearing will be convicted and subject to higher court fines. In 2016, 3233 employers were convicted for late payment of CPF contributions.With effect from 2014, CPF Board has increased general penalties to enhance the deterrent effect on employers of not complying with CPF obligations. This includes penalties for late payment of CPF contributions. For first-time offenders, the maximum fine was doubled to $5,000. A jail term of up to 6 months and 12 months was introduced, as well as a minimum fine of $1,000 and $2,000 for the first offence and subsequent offences respectively. For employers who made good their CPF arrears before their court hearing, the maximum composition amount was doubled to $1,000.MOM and the CPF Board have a proactive educational effort to complement the deterrent effect of its enforcement actions. We run the Workright initiative to raise awareness among employers and employees about their obligations under the CPF Act and Employment Act. WorkRight mobile clinics were deployed across 24 heartland locations last year, and WorkRight guidebooks and toolkits for self-rectification were distributed to employers. WorkRight also increased its proactive inspections ten-fold between 2012 and 2016 to more than 5,000 annually. Through its outreach, WorkRight has helped over 21,000 employers better understand their obligations.We will continue our efforts to increase awareness among employers of their responsibility to meet their CPF obligations so as to ensure timely payment of CPF contributions for employees."
plans for more social service offices,"Mr Seah Kian Peng asked the Minister for Social and Family Development with regard to the Social Service Office (SSO) (a) whether there are plans to set up more of such offices and, if so, where will these be located; (b) whether the results have met the Ministry's expectations and objectives; and (c) whether the operating procedures including operating hours are the same throughout all SSOs.","Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: In 2013, MSF started setting up Social Service Offices in HDB towns, to provide more accessible and coordinated social assistance to Singaporeans in need. The rollout of the full network of 24 Social Service Offices (SSOs) was completed in 2015, and 95% of ComCare beneficiaries now live or work within two kilometres of an SSO. There are no immediate plans to set up more SSOs.Our SSOs have largely been successful in meeting our broad objectives. Physical accessibility and awareness of ComCare have increased because of the SSOs, and this has made it easier for needy families to seek help.Aside from providing ComCare assistance directly, SSOs also do ground-sensing and collaborate with Voluntary Welfare Organisations and community partners to identify needs within each HDB town, to provide more holistic support for those in need. We will continue to explore better ways to be more client-centric and improve service delivery.We have established standard operating procedures and guidelines so that there is consistency in service delivery across SSOs. Notwithstanding this, SSO officers are empowered to exercise flexibility for individual cases, such as in the amount and duration of Short-to-Medium Term Assistance provided, so that social assistance is calibrated according to the needs of the household.With regard to operating hours, standalone SSOs are open on weekdays from 9 am to 6 pm and closed for lunch from 1 pm to 2 pm. The four SSOs which are co-located with Workforce Singapore (WSG) and the Employment and Employability Institute (e2i) Career Centres have adopted the same operating hours as the WSG and e2i centres – these SSOs close at 5 pm on weekdays, and remain open during lunch and on Saturdays from 9 am to 1 pm."
measures to increase security at mrt stations near large-scale event venues,"Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Transport (a) what measures will be implemented to increase security at MRT stations around and near venues which host big events such as the National Stadium, have heavy pedestrian traffic or are near vital facilities such as Changi Airport; and (b) whether baggage scanners will be introduced at all MRT stations.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The Public Transport Security Committee (PTSC), a multi-agency body led by the Land Transport Authority (LTA), constantly reviews security threats to our public transport network, and recalibrates the security measures as necessary. Our risk-based approach seeks to strike a balance between ensuring security and facilitating commuter flows and public transport operations.A multi-layered set of measures is currently in place. The Public Transport Operators (PTOs) engage security guards to patrol MRT stations and bus interchanges. This is supplemented by CCTV surveillance. Police officers from the Public Transport Security Command (TransCom), as well as officers from other Police units such as the Emergency Response Teams, and Special Operations Command also conduct patrols. Security exercises involving the relevant agencies are conducted regularly.Whenever there are major events taking place near an MRT station, Police works with the PTOs and LTA to step up security within the MRT station and also the surrounding areas.During periods of heightened threat, additional security measures may be deployed. One such measure the PTSC is considering is the deployment of screening equipment, such as baggage scanners, at MRT stations.Commuters also play an important role in ensuring the safety and security of our public transport system, by cooperating when stopped for security checks, and by looking out for and reporting suspicious persons and unattended items to the authorities. Members of the public should also not leave their belongings unattended in MRT stations and trains, so as to not cause unnecessary public alarm and inconvenience."
minimum lease period left on a property for withdrawal of cpf monies for mortgage,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Manpower whether the CPF Board will review the minimum lease period left for residential properties that a CPF member can apply for withdrawal of CPF monies to finance the purchase or repayment of financing for such properties.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: To strike a balance between safeguarding CPF savings for retirement and housing needs, the minimum lease period for the use of CPF savings has been set at 30 years. This is because short-lease properties depreciate quickly. If sold, it will likely not raise enough proceeds to ensure a full refund of the CPF savings that has been withdrawn.For properties with a remaining lease of between 30 and 60 years, CPF savings can be used if two conditions are met. Firstly, the remaining lease must cover the youngest buyer at least up to age 80. Secondly, the total amount of CPF withdrawable is subject to a pro-rated Valuation Limit. The Valuation Limit is set at the lower of the purchase price or property value at the time of purchase.For example, a 35-year old member purchases a property with a remaining lease of 50 years. By the time he reaches age 55, the property will have a remaining lease of 30 years, or only 60% of the lease period of 50 years. Hence, the maximum amount of CPF savings he can use will be capped at 60% of the Valuation Limit of the property.These safeguards ensure that the property has a lease that is long enough to cover the CPF members’ retirement years. In the event that the property is sold, these safeguards improve the likelihood that the CPF withdrawn can be refunded to provide for the member’s retirement expenses. These safeguards also ensure that members do not over-consume their CPF savings on properties that they are likely to outlive.MOM will continue to monitor the CPF housing withdrawal rules to take into account increasing life expectancy and changes in the property market. Our aim is to help Singaporeans make prudent housing choices while safeguarding their retirement adequacy."
complaints on workmanship defects in bto flats,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the number of complaints that HDB has received in 2016 from BTO owners in Punggol with regard to workmanship defects in their flats after the one-year defect liability period; (b) whether HDB makes an assessment on each feedback to determine whether it is a latent defect that has caused problems after the liability period; and (c) whether all new BTO flat owners have a six-year latent defect liability period similar to those of private developments.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: For the recently completed BTO projects in Punggol where the one-year Defects Liability Period (DLP) has just expired in 2016, HDB received about 4 cases of feedback on workmanship issues per 1,000 units per month.When residents move into their flats and report any defects to HDB during the 1-year DLP, HDB will arrange for the contractor to carry out repairs. The 1-year DLP is industry-wide practice, and is aligned with that for private developments.If any issue is reported after the DLP, HDB will first investigate the likely cause and advise flat owners on the follow-up action accordingly. If the issue is assessed to arise from workmanship of the building contractor, it is considered a defect and HDB may recall the building contractor to rectify it. However, if the issue is due to wear and tear or flat owner’s own actions, flat owners will be responsible for any rectification works.The Member has referred to a ""latent defect liability period"". I believe he is referring to the limitation period under the Limitation Act, which sets out how long a developer is legally liable for defects from the time of completion of a project. The duration of the limitation period for latent defects is 15 years. This applies to private developers and HDB. As there are many reasons why defects emerge after the DLP, HDB assesses each defect – even those which emerge after DLP – on a case-by-case basis."
trend and impact of singaporeans marrying foreigners,Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what is the trend over the past five years on Singaporean men and women marrying foreigners; (b) what is the impact of this on the future of Singaporean society; and (c) whether any in-depth study has been done on the implications of such marriages.,"Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: The proportion of marriages between Singaporean Citizens and Non-Residents declined slightly between 2011 and 2015. Of all marriages involving at least one Singapore Citizen, the proportion of Singaporean Citizens marrying Non-Residents decreased from 30% in 2011 to 27% in 2015. Among these marriages, the proportion of Singaporean men marrying Non-Residents decreased from 80% in 2011 to 75% in 2015, while the proportion of Singaporean women marrying Non-Residents increased from 20% in 2011 to 25% in 2015.My Ministry studies the outcomes of marriages between Singapore Citizens and Non-Residents regularly and reviews our support measures accordingly. We recognise that these marriages create Singaporean families and are part of our society. As some of these marriages may face unique challenges, we have introduced marriage programmes since December 2014. These programmes help couples in such marriages manage cross-cultural differences as they settle down in Singapore, and strengthen their marriages. They include the Marriage Preparation Programme offered before marriage, and the Marriage Support Programme for newly-weds, which provides information on available community resources and assists Non-Resident spouses in adapting to life in Singapore. In addition, the Friendship Programme supports these couples through family bonding activities, support group sessions, and pairing of volunteers to Non-Resident spouses as ""buddies""."
mitigation of stress levels amongst healthcare workers,"Ms K Thanaletchimi asked the Minister for Health (a) whether there have been any studies conducted or commissioned to study the stress levels of healthcare workers, especially nurses, allied health professionals and doctors; (b) if so, whether the Ministry is able to share those findings and plans to work with the public healthcare institutions to mitigate the stress effects; and (c) if no study has been conducted, whether the Ministry will consider commissioning such a study as part of workplace safety and health and work-life balance considerations.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Our public healthcare clusters conduct surveys to gather feedback from their employees on workplace stress. Common sources of stress in the hospitals include the fast pace of work, unreasonable demands from patients and their caregivers, and personal issues such as health or financial problems. Detailed findings cannot be shared because the scale and scope of surveys, as well as the profile of staff surveyed, differ across clusters. While the findings vary across clusters, the findings are shared with relevant staff and are used to develop programmes to support employees in managing workplace stress and maintaining mental well-being.Employee support programmes that have been implemented range from lunch-time talks and workshops on mental health and stress and emotional management, to staff counselling programmes to help them overcome work stress and personal problems. Some employers also have dedicated hotlines for their employees to seek professional help.The public healthcare clusters will continue to work closely with the Healthcare Services Employees’ Union to improve employee health and well-being at the workplace."
additional tests for drivers aged over 75,Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether the Traffic Police will consider introducing cognitive or further tests for drivers who are seeking to renew their driving licences when they are over 75 years old.,"Mr K Shanmugam: All holders of car and motorcycle driving licences are required to pass a medical examination, when they turn 65 years old and every three years thereafter. A medical practitioner will assess the licence holder’s physical and mental fitness to drive, including reviewing his medical history, vision, hearing and mobility. This medical examination remains suitable for assessing the fitness to drive of elderly who are 75 years or older.Those holding heavy vehicle driving licences are subjected to a stricter regime. They have to take and pass the medical examination every year after turning 65 years old. The medical examination for those aged 70 years and above includes a wider range of physical and mental fitness tests. Their heavy vehicle licences will cease to be valid when they turn 75 years old.Ultimately, the onus is on the individual to take responsibility for his own safety, as well as the safety of other road-users. Licence holders should refrain from driving or riding when they know of conditions that may render them unfit for doing so.Traffic Police will continue to monitor the situation, and make adjustments to the licence regime for elderly licence holders if required."
assessment of visibility of pedestrians at partially-blocked pedestrian crossings,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Transport (a) how does the Ministry assess motorists' visibility of pedestrians at pedestrian crossings that are partially covered by shrubs and bushes; and (b) whether the Ministry has a standardised framework for assessment and subsequent pruning schedules for the safety of pedestrians.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The Land Transport Authority (LTA) establishes no-planting zones around pedestrian crossings to ensure that motorist have a clear view of pedestrians. The size of these no-planting zones depends on site conditions, such as the geometry of the road and the speed limit. In addition, NParks conducts inspections at least once a month to make sure that greenery does not block the visibility of crossings."
incidence of single unwed moms who adopt biological children,"Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for Social and Family Development in light of reports that single unmarried mothers have to adopt their biological children to ""normalise"" a family nucleus (a) how many cases have been handled in the past five years; (b) how many of such cases have been rejected; and (c) whether the Ministry will review its policy to help the children of these mothers to enjoy the same rights as that of a married couple.","Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: From 2012 to 2016, my Ministry assessed five applications from unwed mothers to adopt their biological children. One mother subsequently withdrew her application, while the Court granted the adoption order to the remaining four applicants.Unwed mothers do not need to, or benefit more from Government policies and schemes if they adopt their own children. Singaporean children have access to a range of government benefits that support their growth and development, regardless of their parent’s marital status. These include the Medisave grant for newborns, infant care and childcare subsidies and the foreign domestic worker levy concession. In addition, all Singaporean children have access to social assistance, education and healthcare subsidies.Last year, we reviewed and extended the Child Development Account, or CDA benefits to children born from 1 September 2016 to unwed parents. Unwed mothers of children born from 1 January 2017 are also now eligible for Government-Paid Maternity Leave. These benefits will support the child’s developmental needs, and the parent’s efforts to care and provide for the child. We also introduced the KidSTART programme last year, which will proactively identify low-income and vulnerable children aged six and below. These may include children of unwed parents. KidSTART will help to provide them with early access to health, learning and development support, and monitor their progress during their early years.Benefits such as the Baby Bonus cash gift and housing benefits are meant to encourage parenthood within marriage, which is the desired and prevailing social norm in Singapore. They are not extended even if an unwed mother adopts her own child.Unwed mothers do adopt their own children, but for personal reasons. Our law places the child’s welfare and interests at the heart of an adoption decision. We must not forget that such an adoption is a life-changing event because when an unwed mother adopts her child, the duties, obligations and liabilities of the biological father are terminated. In other words, there is no longer a parental relationship between the child and his or her biological father. The child would also not be able to seek maintenance from the father under the Women's Charter. An unwed mother who intends to adopt her own child may wish to seek legal advice to fully understand the implications of an adoption order."
inter-ministerial committee to enhance outreach efforts to smokers on smoking hazards,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Health whether there is an inter-ministerial committee looking at the different ways to educate smokers on smoking hazards.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: While there is no formal inter-ministerial committee to oversee the efforts to educate smokers on smoking hazards, MOH works closely with relevant government agencies and educational institutions to educate Singaporeans on the health risks of tobacco use and to help smokers quit smoking.For example, the Health Promotion Board (HPB) works closely with the Ministry of Education and Institutes of Higher Learning to incorporate anti-tobacco messages into the schools’ curriculum and co-curricular activities. This is to raise awareness about the benefits of leading a tobacco-free lifestyle and to inform youths on the harms of tobacco smoking. In addition, Student Health Advisors are deployed to some schools to provide support and counselling to students on health issues, including smoking cessation counselling. HPB also organises interactive programmes, such as skits and workshops to discourage experimentation with tobacco products and teach students ways to refuse offers to smoke. Our outreach efforts have reached out to about 50,000 students in 2016.HPB launched the ""I Quit"" programme in 2011, and worked with People’s Association and employers to organise roadshows at community events and workplaces to encourage smokers to sign-up for the I Quit 28-Day Countdown smoking cessation programme. HPB also works closely with the Ministry of Defence on smoking cessation workshops to educate SAF servicemen on the harmful effects of smoking and encourage them to quit smoking. Smokers can call HPB’s QuitLine or access online resources, such as the HPB HealthHub portal, for additional support to quit smoking. In 2016, these programmes reached more than 16,000 smokers.In addition, MOH has mandated graphic health warnings on the harms of smoking on tobacco product packaging since 2004. These are revised on a regular basis to ensure their relevance.We will continue to press on with anti-smoking public educational efforts, and collaborate with the various agencies in this area where necessary."
consumer complaints against premium rate telecommunication services providers,Mr Yee Chia Hsing asked the Minister for Communications and Information whether the Ministry monitors the incidence of complaints from mobile phone users against Premium Rate Services (PRS) providers and whether action is taken to bar or blacklist errant PRS providers.,"Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim: Premium Rate Services or PRS for short, are value-added mobile content services subscribed via SMS. In 2007, the Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA) introduced a PRS Code of Practice. The PRS Code requires providers to publish the terms and conditions of their service, authenticate the user, and ensure that explicit purchase confirmation is received prior to service activation. These safeguards help consumers avoid accidental subscriptions.Since the Code was introduced, IMDA has taken enforcement actions in 28 cases. The actions ranged from issuing warnings to imposing financial penalties, with the highest being $100,000. Repeat offenders could also have their licences suspended or cancelled.Apart from the PRS Code, IMDA has required mobile operators to offer a PRS barring service since 2012. Consumers who activate this service will not receive PRS or be billed even if they have accidentally subscribed to the PRS.As such, the number of PRS-related complaints received by IMDA has fallen significantly by 74% over the last five years, from 483 complaints in 2012 to 126 complaints in 2016.Most of the remaining complaints relate to allegations of being charged for unsolicited PRS. IMDA’s investigations generally revealed that consumers did not read the terms and conditions of the PRS carefully before subscribing to the PRS.I urge consumers to pay closer attention to the terms and conditions of a PRS before subscribing to any PRS and to look out for SMS reminder messages highlighting charges payable. Consumers can also activate the PRS barring service for themselves and family members."
blacklisting training providers who profiteer from skillsfuture programme,"Ms Chia Yong Yong asked the Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) whether the Government monitors the training providers market to ascertain and blacklist those who profiteer from the SkillsFuture programme by substantially marking up their course fees and, if so, what is the number of those identified and how many have been blacklisted.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: There are many SkillsFuture programmes and initiatives in place. The significant ones, including those structured as SkillsFuture Earn and Learn Programmes, or training that lead to jobs, are delivered by reputable partners such as post-secondary education institutions, and reputable private training providers such as 3dsense Media School Pte Ltd in digital animation, Air Transport Training College in aerospace, Hua Mei Training Academy in social work, etc.Soon, SkillsFuture Singapore will be launching the SkillsFuture for Digital Workplace Programme, a two day foundational skills programme to help workers adjust to a digitally rich working environment. In rolling out the course, SkillsFuture Singapore worked with seven training providers which it has strong working relationship with.For all these programmes, SSG works closely with training providers to ensure course fees are reasonable.But as SkillsFuture is also an inclusive movement, there are over 650 private training providers that are part of the SkillsFuture Credit scheme. For these, competition between the training providers helps to keep a check on course fees. In addition, SSG scrutinises the proposed course fees using industry benchmarks to ensure they are reasonable when compared with other similar courses.SSG will also enforce against any practice of profiteering. Since 2016, SSG has suspended 17 organisations from SSG funding for serious breaches of SSG funding rules, such as false declarations of trainee eligibility or course fees."
proposal for insurance coverage for mental illnesses,Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the Government can explore the provision of insurance coverage for mental illnesses; and (b) what financial support is available for mental health patients when they are unable to work for a prolonged period of time.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Singaporeans with mental illnesses are receiving funding support for their treatments. In 2013, MediShield was enhanced to cover inpatient treatment of psychiatric conditions so as to support the timely and appropriate treatment of mental illnesses. This health insurance coverage remains under MediShield Life today.Government subsidies are also available to patients receiving inpatient and outpatient mental health treatments and consultations at public healthcare institutions. For CHAS cardholders, subsidies are provided for outpatient consultations at CHAS GPs.Patients who need to pay for the balance of their fees after Government subsidies and MediShield Life can use their Medisave. Under the Chronic Disease Management Programme (CDMP), Medisave may be used for the outpatient treatment of bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, depression and anxiety. Seniors can further tap on Flexi-Medisave for their outpatient treatment. Those who cannot afford their treatments even after subsidies, MediShield Life and Medisave can approach the medical social workers for Medifund assistance.Some Singaporeans with mental illnesses may require financial assistance that extend beyond their treatments. They can apply for such assistance under ComCare through the Social Service Offices. Depending on the needs and circumstances of the individuals, the ComCare package could include cash and other types of assistance such as utilities charges and housing rental fees. Individuals who have permanent mental incapacity can also apply for early CPF withdrawal under the Medical Grounds Scheme."
long-term building maintenance cost consideration in hdb design planning,"Dr Tan Wu Meng asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether HDB design planning considers factors that affect the long-term cost of building exterior upkeep, including (i) accessibility of building features such as beams and ledges where high-rise litter may accumulate (ii) the number of such features in any given HDB block; and (b) whether such features have been incorporated for cosmetic versus structural integrity considerations.","Mr Lawrence Wong: The accessibility and ease of maintenance of common areas, including exterior features, are key aspects that HDB considers in the design of its buildings.External features such as ledges and beams are provided for a functional purpose. Concrete ledges or canopies are provided above windows to provide shade and protect flats from rain. For instance, without such canopies, rain water flowing down the building faأ§ade may enter the flats if the windows are open or not closed tightly. As for beams, external tie beams are required in some projects to ensure the structural robustness and stability of the building.Design-wise, HDB generally ensures that canopies are gently sloped to allow water discharge. In addition, the use of tie beams is minimised, and these are only deployed where necessary.If a lot of high-rise litter is thrown by residents, it will inevitably accumulate on external ledges and beams. We hope residents can play their part in maintaining the cleanliness of the common areas and refrain from throwing litter out of their windows."
cleaning frequency for compactors at bin centres,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what is the rationale for NEA's requirement for cleaning of the compactor at bin centres to be set at once a month; (b) whether this cleaning frequency is sufficient especially for bin centres near hawker centres; and (c) whether the Ministry is introducing technology to assist cleaning contractors in managing the hygiene of the bin centres.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The National Environment Agency (NEA) does not set specific requirements for the cleaning of compactors at bin centres. However, our public waste collectors send the compactors to their depots for maintenance and cleaning once a month to ensure that the equipment is in good working condition and maintained in a clean and presentable state.In addition to the monthly cleaning of the compactors by the public waste collectors, all premises owners are responsible under the Environmental Public Health (Public Cleansing) Regulations for ensuring that their refuse bin centres are kept in a clean and sanitary condition and in good repair. For example, most Town Council cleaners practise daily cleaning of the external surfaces of the compactors. In addition, the cleaning contractors of all hawker centres owned by my Ministry are contractually required to clean the refuse bin centres daily. Similar arrangements are also adopted by the Town Councils for hawker centres owned by the Housing and Development Board.To ensure better management of the hygiene of bin centres, the NEA is working with the cleaning industry to encourage greater use of technology to enhance the productivity and effectiveness of cleaners."
building and maintenance costs of multi-storey car parks,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the average cost of building a multi-storey car park and surface car park respectively; (b) what is the monthly maintenance charge for a car park; and (c) what is the average subsidy for each car park if the monthly parking charge is insufficient to cover the replacement and maintenance cost.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Construction costs vary for different car parks built over the years as they depend on factors such as the prevailing cost of construction materials and site-specific constraints. In general, it costs about three to five times more to build a multi-storey car park compared to a surface car park, on a per lot basis.On average, general maintenance, improvement and repair costs take up about 20% of yearly car park expenditure. However, parking charges do not cover only maintenance costs ? the bulk of expenditure for HDB car parks comes from building works as well as other operating costs such as car park management and enforcement. The total costs of building, operating and maintaining car parks have increased over the years, because of rising overheads in the construction industry, more capital expenditures for new and existing car parks, and additional repair works required to maintain an increasing number of ageing car parks.Last year, we estimated that without any increase in car park charges, HDB would incur a deficit of around $100 million annually in the coming years. Even with the revised parking charges, we expect HDB to continue to run a deficit in the coming years."
crimes and incidence of public disturbances related to alcohol abuse,Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked the Minister for Home Affairs with regard to alcohol abuse (a) what are the number of related crimes and incidences of public disturbances in the last three years; and (b) whether the Government will consider restricting the sale of alcohol to Government-run stores as like in the Nordic countries.,"Mr K Shanmugam: With the enactment of the Liquor Control Act in 2015, we have taken significant steps to control the supply and consumption of liquor in public places to mitigate public disorder and disamenities caused by public drunkenness. We have restricted the sale of alcohol at retail outlets and consumption of liquor in public places to 7 am to 10.30 pm daily. Stricter hours are imposed in the designated liquor control zones in Little India and Geylang.The result is positive. There is an island-wide decline of public order incidents related to liquor consumption, from 251 cases in 2014 to 135 cases in 2016. This includes offences like rioting, affray and serious hurt.We therefore see no need to set up Government-run liquor retail stores and to only allow such stores to sell liquor. This is best left to the private sector, with the Government putting in place laws to regulate such sales.The Police will continue to monitor the situation, and conduct regular compliance checks on licensed liquor retail outlets."
findings of incident at national dental centre where unsterilised instruments were used on patients,Dr Tan Wu Meng asked the Minister for Health regarding the National Dental Centre Singapore (NDCS) incident of instruments used on patients despite not completing the full sterilisation process (a) whether the Ministry has ascertained how the incident occurred and the chronology and decision-making process within NDCS when the incident was discovered; (b) whether the affected instruments could have been recalled faster; and (c) what lessons can be drawn from the incident.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Patient safety is of utmost importance to our public healthcare institutions. We apologise for the lapse at the National Dental Centre Singapore (NDCS) on 5 and 6 June, which had led to the use of partially sterilised dental instruments.SingHealth has conducted an investigation and MOH has received its report on 30 June 2017. The Ministry is reviewing the report and is also conducting its own investigation.The SingHealth investigation showed that on the afternoon of 5 June, a staff of the Central Sterile Supplies Department (CSSD) of the NDCS failed to complete all the steps in the sterilisation process for one batch of dental instruments. The batch of affected instruments were subsequently dispatched to the outpatient clinics at levels 2, 4 and 6 of the NDCS.Around 4 pm, another NDCS staff noticed that the sterilisation indicator tapes on some instrument packs had not changed colour, indicating that the sterilisation process has not been completed. She alerted the first NDCS staff as well as her immediate supervisor. An immediate attempt was made to recall the affected instruments. However, not all the affected instruments were retrieved.On 6 June, before NDCS started operations at 8 am, the manager of the CSSD checked the sterilisation records and detected the incomplete sterilisation of one batch of instruments on the previous day. She activated the department to retrieve all affected instruments from the clinics.At 4 pm on 6 June, the manager of the CSSD reported the incident to the senior management of the NDCS. The Director of the NDCS immediately activated another round of recalls to ensure that all affected instruments were retrieved. Prior to the start of clinic hours on 7 June, all dental instruments were thoroughly checked and confirmed to have undergone the complete sterilisation process. Additional controls such as requiring a second person to check that the sterilisation process was completed were also implemented.Among the 714 patients who had visited the outpatient clinics on levels 2, 4 and 6 from the late afternoon on 5 June to the end of clinic hours on 6 June, up to 72 could have come into contact with the affected instruments as there were up to 72 sets of the affected instruments that had been used. As the first two steps of the sterilisation process were completed, including thermal washer disinfection which would remove close to 100% of organisms of concern, the risk of infection to patients was assessed to be extremely low.NDCS dentists began contacting all of these patients on 10 June, to inform them of the incident and reassure them on their low risk of infection.From the findings, the incident originated from human error by a staff. In addition, her supervisor and department manager did not fully recognise the potential impact of the error. As a result, there was a delay in escalating the incident to senior management and up to 72 packs of affected instruments might have been used on patients, before all affected instruments were successfully recalled.The findings also revealed procedural weaknesses and a lack of vigilance amongst some staff. At various points of the process ? from the issuance of the instruments from the CSSD, through the receipt of the instruments at the clinics, to the unpacking of the instruments before use on patients, the error could have been detected and an alert raised.Following the incident, NDCS has instituted immediate corrective measures. Additional independent verifications have been put in place to ensure completeness of the sterilisation process. Clearer work instructions have been disseminated to all staff to ensure that the sterility of the dental instruments are checked prior to use.NDCS has also audited their sterilisation records in the six months prior to the incident. The records confirmed that sterilisation was completed in all other cases. A check on the sterilisation equipment also indicated that it was fully functioning.NDCS will strengthen the following(i) Standard operating procedures for sterilisation, handover and use of dental instruments;(ii) Documentation and inventory accounting process for sterilisation and movement of dental instruments from CSSD to the clinics, and(iii) Incident escalation and reporting, recall and risk management frameworks.In addition, NDCS will institute regular training and competency assessments for all staff involved in the sterilisation and handling of instruments to ensure familiarity with the processes.Four NDCS staff directly involved in the incident, including supervisors and senior NDCS management, have been found to have fallen short in their level of vigilance, and the speed in escalation of incident management. Disciplinary actions have been taken against them. These include warnings, as well as financial penalties.The Ministry will review the findings of the SingHealth report, as well as our own investigation findings. We will consider if further regulatory actions are necessary. We will also closely monitor the implementation of remedial actions and standards of care at NDCS through regular audits.While the risk of infection to affected patients is extremely low in this incident, it is a serious breach of the institution’s infection control system nonetheless. Our healthcare institutions need to be more vigilant, and have a stronger reporting and incident escalation culture. These will enable us to detect and mitigate any incidents expeditiously. The learning points from this incident will be shared across the healthcare clusters, so that we can collectively improve our standard of patient safety and care."
help for women with post-natal depression,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Health (a) among women who had recently given birth, what is the percentage who develop post-natal depression; (b) what subsidised resources are available to women who are diagnosed with post-natal depression; and (c) whether the Ministry will make available free post-partum mental health screening and follow-up care for all Singaporean women regardless of where they have given birth.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: A local study4 conducted by NUH found that the prevalence of maternal depression is about 12% antenatally, and 7% postnatally.Most pregnant women are managed by the obstetricians during their pregnancy, who play a major role in identifying antenatal and postnatal depression symptoms both in the private and public sectors.Since 2007, KKH and NUH have been funded under the National Mental Health Blueprint to provide screening and early intervention for postnatal depression. The NUH Women’s Emotional Health Service (WEHS) and KKH’s Postnatal Depression Intervention Programme (PDIP) provide depression screening at 2-8 weeks postpartum, at no charge, during outpatient postnatal review at the specialist clinics. Under the NUH WEHS, women are also screened antenatally at three time points – registration, trimester two, and trimester three. Both programmes accept patients referred from other hospitals, including private hospitals. Since 2007, both programmes have screened around 80,050 women, and 818 women were subsequently referred to, and seen by psychiatrists for further follow up.Women who are screened positive for depression would be managed by a multidisciplinary team comprising a psychiatrist, case manager, and psychologist. The women and their family members will also be given useful contacts and information on managing their emotional health.Both programmes also provide antenatal talks and classes open to women and their spouses, covering antenatal and postnatal depression, and on keeping emotionally well during and after pregnancy. Through various media platforms, KKH also raises public awareness on postnatal depression.Patients who require outpatient treatment for major depression and anxiety can receive subsidies for their treatment at our public healthcare institutions. They can also tap on Medisave under the Chronic Disease Management Programme. Needy patients who cannot afford medical treatment can approach the Medical Social Worker at the healthcare institutions for financial assistance."
study on environmental impact of disposable food packaging,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what are the results of the tender called in August 2016 to study the life-cycle assessment and environmental impact of disposable food packaging; and (b) whether the quantity of disposable food packaging used has increased in the last three years.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The National Environment Agency (NEA) awarded the study on how different types of disposable food packaging materials compare in terms of cost and environmental impact in September 2016. The study is expected to conclude in the second half of 2017.Between 2014 and 2016, the amount of domestic waste disposed of in Singapore was around 1.7 million tonnes per year, of which about one-third was packaging waste. Packaging waste includes disposable food packaging. Though the amount of packaging waste disposed of has remained fairly constant over the past few years, the amount may increase with population and economic growth.My Ministry manages the impact of plastic packaging on the environment through the safe incineration of waste rather than direct landfilling. However, it is important that we also continue to make progress on measures to reduce packaging waste.While my Ministry recognises that plastic bags and disposable takeaway containers are frequently used out of convenience, we strongly encourage businesses to reduce excessive usage and consumers to use their own reusable bags and takeaway food carriers. Doing so would help conserve valuable resources and reduce the overall waste volume.We will continue to work with manufacturers, retailers and environmental groups to encourage consumers to reduce the use of disposable food packaging. More recently, for new hawker centres such as at Our Tampines Hub, Pasir Ris and Yishun, we have taken the additional step of disallowing the use of disposables for dining in at these hawker centres. We will look into more ways to reduce the use of disposable food packaging based on the results of the ongoing study."
fee collection during post-health screening consultation at polyclinics,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the reason for collecting a fee at the polyclinic when patients receive their health screening results during the post-screening consultation; and (b) why does the practice differ from that of general practitioner clinics.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Patients with normal health screening results may have their results mailed to them and there is no need for them to visit the polyclinics. If they prefer, they can also collect their results at the polyclinics. There is no additional fee charged by polyclinics for the original issuance of the screening results.For patients who require further evaluation, it is important that the doctor meets with the patient to review the results, address concerns and/or advise on management options. Medication and treatment may also be initiated if necessary. Patients with existing chronic conditions may review their results during their next scheduled appointment at no additional cost, or at a separate sitting, if necessary. A standard subsidised polyclinic consultation fee would apply for Singaporeans and Permanent Residents.General Practitioner (GP) clinics offer different types of health screening and adopt different charging practices. Some package the health screening and post-screening consultation in a single charge, while others charge patients a separate fee for post-screening follow-ups. GPs may also decide that mailing of results would suffice when a face to face visit is not needed.As part of the enhanced Screen For Life (SFL) initiative which will take effect from 1 September 2017, we are extending subsidies for all eligible Singaporeans for recommended screenings at Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) GP clinics. This is part of our national strategy to encourage health screening and follow-ups, as well as to reinforce the role of GPs in preventive health and chronic disease management. Under the enhanced SFL initiative, eligible Singaporeans will pay a single nominal fee for the screening tests and post-screening consultation where required. Pioneers need not pay."
drop-out rates at polytechnics,"Ms K Thanaletchimi asked the Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (a) how many polytechnic students dropped out of their course over the last five years; (b) whether the polytechnics provide a second chance for these dropouts to either take on other diploma programmes which they are more passionate about or resume the course which they have stopped and, if so, whether there have been any success cases; and (c) whether the polytechnics will allow more opportunities for those dropouts who are keen to continue their polytechnic studies.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: Over the last five years, an average of 5% of each polytechnic cohort have withdrawn from their course. Should these students like to return to their course of study, polytechnics adopt a case-by-case approach to understand the student’s situation and reasons for course withdrawal before evaluating each case.For students who wish to pursue another course of study, they may do so via the Polytechnics’ Direct Admissions Exercise. On average over the past five years, around 950 students who had formally withdrawn from their courses apply for re-admission to the polytechnics through this route every year. About 40% of these students are successful. As part of the admission process, polytechnics assess these students on their aptitude and interests, allowing them to gain admission by demonstrating their commitment to their new chosen fields.Apart from providing opportunities for students to return to study, we recognise that students do well and stay engaged when they understand their own interests and aptitudes, and pursue courses that they are passionate about. Besides enhancing education and career guidance to help students understand their strengths and aspirations, the polytechnics have also expanded aptitude-based admissions to assess students beyond their academic scores."
starting school later to allow students to sleep more,"Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked the Minister for Education (Schools) whether the Ministry will consider starting schools at 8.30 am or later in consideration of the biological changes in the sleep cycles of teenagers and the long term health benefits, as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics and local health institutions.","72 Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Education (Schools) whether the Ministry will consider encouraging more schools to start classes later following the recent sleep studies conducted by the Duke-NUS Medical School and Nanyang Girls' High School.Mr Ng Chee Meng: The preliminary findings from the Duke-NUS Medical School researchers showed that there was a marginal increase of only about 20 minutes of sleep despite a 45-minute delay in school start time. Surveys show that many Singapore students spend time on social media and other online activities before going to bed.Therefore MOE has incorporated the knowledge of sleep hygiene, and self-management skills into the Primary School Physical Education curriculum since 2014. Education on the importance of sleep and good sleep habits will also be incorporated into the Secondary School Physical Education curriculum. Parents play a key role in inculcating good sleeping habits and routines in their children from a young age. MOE will also continue to work with schools to monitor the curriculum and homework load."
penalty for hdb's home improvement programme contractors due to service or quality lapses,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for National Development in respect of HDB's Home Improvement Programme (HIP) (a) whether HDB publishes the names of HIP contractors who have been penalised due to service or quality lapses; and (b) between 2012 and 2016, how many contractors have been awarded contracts for further HIP projects after being penalised for service or quality lapses for earlier HIP projects.","Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB sets quality and service standards for contractors in the execution of Home Improvement Programme (HIP) projects. Based on surveys of precincts which have undergone HIP, at least 90% of residents express satisfaction with the works completed.From time to time, there are service or quality lapses by the contractors. HDB does not publish the names of these contractors, but it takes strict enforcement action against them. Between 2012 and 2016, 22 contractors were penalised with demerit points, of which 7 had an administrative charge imposed on them. Four contractors also performed poorly enough to be restricted from tendering for HDB projects. The tender restriction was lifted only after they showed improvements in performance, and three of them were subsequently successful in tendering for HIP projects."
qualifying criteria to build covered linkway from private housing to nearest bus stop,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Transport (a) what are the qualifying criteria or conditions for a covered linkway to be built from the gates of a private condominium to the nearest bus stop; and (b) in the last three years, how many such covered linkways has the Ministry funded.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The Government does not fund or build covered linkways from private condominiums to bus stops. Instead, under the Walk2Ride Programme, LTA will build a covered linkway from a condominium to an MRT station located within 400 metres, or to an LRT station or a bus interchange within 200 metres. This linkway may, in some cases, connect with bus stops along the way.The key condition for the Government to provide such a covered linkway from the gate of the condominium to a major public transport node, is that the condominium must provide a sheltered route within its compound from the residential blocks to the gate. This ensures a seamless, sheltered connection the entire way. It would not make sense for the Government to fund a covered linkway from the gate, if the walk inside the condominium is exposed to the weather anyway."
measurement of speed of vehicles in assessing erp charges for expressway,Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for Transport how does LTA currently measure the speed of vehicles in assessing the ERP charges for an expressway.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The speeds of vehicles along expressways are measured using both data from sensors on GPS-enabled taxis and traffic monitoring cameras. ERP rates for expressways are reduced when vehicular speeds consistently exceed 65 km/hour, and increased when they consistently fall below 45 km/hour. This is reviewed every quarter."
reduction of breakdown of mrt train services,Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for Transport whether any other action can be taken to reduce the breakdown of MRT train services.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Improving rail reliability is a multi-year effort. It comprises four major elements.First, timely replacement and upgrading of ageing assets. This applies especially to our oldest North-South and East-West Lines. We have completed the replacement of all the wooden sleepers with new concrete sleepers. We will soon complete the replacement of the third rail system, which supplies power to the trains. We will soon begin the process to replace the ageing power system and the first-generation train fleet.Meanwhile, we are in the last phase of trials for the new signalling system on the North-South Line. The signalling system upgrade for the East-West Line will be completed next year. Re-signalling is not a simple exercise and similar projects elsewhere had experienced delays and disruptions during implementation. We have to be patient as LTA, SMRT and the equipment supplier painstakingly iron out all the hitches in the new system.Second, build up the expertise of our rail engineers. We have set up the Singapore Rail Academy to augment industry efforts in developing rail expertise and manpower. Through various international advisory panels, we are actively tapping on international experiences and adopting best practices.Third, reform our maintenance regime. We have introduced process-based Maintenance Performance Standards to address maintenance issues upstream, before delays occur. We have also begun to incorporate predictive maintenance concepts to raise efficiency and effectiveness.Fourth, step up investment in maintenance and engineering. LTA and the operators have increased their maintenance and engineering manpower significantly. They have also set up Joint Teams to regularly review the reliability performance of individual rail lines, identify the causes, develop targeted solutions and monitor the results.All these efforts take years to complete and to produce results. We are not yet where we want to be. However, we have seen good progress. The industry KPI for measuring rail reliability is MKBF Mean Kilometre Between Failure, measuring delays exceeding five minutes. It is a demanding KPI and adopted globally.Last year, I set stretched targets for our operators to work towards an MKBF of 200,000 train-km for 2016, 300,000 km for 2017, 400,000 km for 2018 and 800,000 km by 2020. From January to May 2017, our MRT trains travelled 387,000 train-km between delays of more than five minutes. This is more than double the performance in 2016 of 174,000 train-km. It has also exceeded my stretched targets. It is a pleasant surprise and is greatly inspiring to our teams of engineers and technicians working in the trenches. In fact, three out of the five lines have exceeded next year’s target of 400,000 train-km. Among the three, two have exceeded the 2020 target of 800,000 train-km in the first five months of this year. We are determined to be among the best in rail reliability and we will get there. Please continue to give us your encouragement and support."
infusing technology subjects in current school education system,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Education (Schools) (a) how can technology subjects be incorporated into the current syllabus of our education system so as to have a future-ready education system; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider making basic coding skills compulsory for secondary school students.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: In our secondary school curriculum, students have the opportunities to offer technology-related subjects such as Design and Technology, Computer Applications, Computing and Electronics. Design and Technology is a compulsory subject in the lower secondary curriculum whereas Computer Applications is compulsory for all Normal (Technical) students from Secondary 1 to Secondary 4. Over the past few years, we have introduced more technology-related subjects such as Electronics, Computing, Smart Electrical Technology and Mobile Robotics, which are offered as elective subjects in selected schools.In these subjects, students learn a range of application software, hardware, programming languages and electronics systems to create prototypes and practical solutions with real-world uses. These emphasise experimentation, encourage innovation and require students to apply their knowledge and skills and select an optimal solution under certain constraints. Students are given opportunities to tinker and investigate the systems to gain better conceptual understanding of the working of the components in electronics systems. The syllabus of these subjects are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that they keep in tandem with technological developments.However, our secondary school curriculum is still about fundamental concepts and skills (such as problem solving, design thinking, computational thinking and troubleshooting skills).At the lower secondary, there is limited curriculum time to offer a new subject such as Computing. Hence, our main approach is to enthuse a broad base of students in computing and expose them to possibilities of technology through enrichment programmes and co-curricular activities. Learning to code is part of the Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in 41 secondary schools. In addition, MOE also partners IMDA to provide enrichment programmes like the ""Code for Fun"" and ""Lab on Wheels"", which have been well received by schools. As of March 2016, 117 primary and secondary schools have embarked on the Code for Fun programme, benefiting 34,000 students. There are also a number of secondary schools (33 schools in 2016) with info-comm clubs which tap on the support of IMDA to provide learning in areas involving coding such as app development and robotics."
update on review of medisave limit,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling asked the Minister for Health whether he can provide an update on the review of the Medisave withdrawal limit of $400 per year for (i) patients with chronic illnesses and (ii) those who require long-term special medication that are not subsidised.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Under the Chronic Disease Management Programme (CDMP), Singaporeans can use up to $400 per Medisave account per year to pay for their chronic disease treatment. 19 chronic conditions are covered under CDMP, which accounts for more than 90% of chronic attendances seen at polyclinics today.The $400 CDMP limit was sufficient to fully cover the post-subsidy bill for nine in 10 subsidised patients with common chronic conditions at public healthcare institutions and participating CHAS GP clinics. At these institutions, elderly patients age 65 and above may also tap on an additional $200 Flexi-Medisave each year to help pay for their outpatient treatments.Patients with higher medical bills for chronic conditions can tap on the Medisave accounts of their spouse, children and parents, up to $400 per family member per year. To illustrate, an elderly patient with a spouse and two children could use up to $1,800 of Medisave per year for his chronic conditions ? $600 from his own Medisave account and $400 each from his wife and children. If they still face financial difficulties, they can apply for Medifund at the polyclinics or subsidised specialist outpatient clinics in public hospitals. The Medication Assistance Fund is also available for needy patients who require long-term medication that are not on the Standard Drug List.MOH will continue to monitor the affordability of chronic disease care and regularly review the Medisave withdrawal limits."
singaporeans who are eligible for workfare income supplement but who are left out,"Ms K Thanaletchimi asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether there are cases of Singaporean workers who meet the eligibility criteria for the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) payouts but who have been omitted from such payouts; (b) if so, who and where should these workers make their appeals to; and (c) if there are such omissions, how can the Ministry ensure that WIS payouts reach all eligible workers.","Mr Lim Swee Say: The Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) Scheme is designed to supplement the incomes and retirement savings for the bottom 20% of Singaporeans by income percentile, with a smaller degree of support up to the 30th income percentile.Workers who are eligible for WIS will not be omitted from receiving WIS payouts. However, there were some cases where workers may not have received their WIS payouts. This was mainly because their circumstances had changed after the data cut-off dates. These workers can approach CPF Board to reassess their eligibility for WIS. We accept appeals for up to two years after the year in which the work was done, in recognition that some workers may not lodge their appeals immediately.In January 2017, we implemented several enhancements to WIS such as paying WIS on a monthly instead of quarterly basis, and increasing the qualifying monthly income ceiling from $1,900 to $2,000. About 460,000 Singaporeans are expected to receive WIS for work done this year. These changes ensured that WIS would continue to provide a meaningful level of support to low-wage Singaporean workers."
civil lawsuits against principals and teachers,Dr Tan Wu Meng asked the Minister for Education (Schools) over the past three years (a) how many civil lawsuits have been initiated against school principals and teachers in their official educator capacity; (b) what proportion has been initiated by students or parents/or students' next-of-kin; (c) what are the reasons cited for such lawsuits; and (d) whether the Ministry provides (i) legal aid coverage and/or (ii) professional liability insurance for educators who may face such lawsuits arising from their official duties.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: Lawsuits initiated against our educators in relation to their official duties are few and far in between. In the past three years, there have only been two such lawsuits; with only one having been initiated by a parent against an educator. That case involved the parent suing the Principal of his child’s school for the return of a mobile phone that was confiscated in accordance with the school’s rules.An educator who faces such a lawsuit may be provided with legal representation in a number of ways. This can take the form of representation by the Attorney-General’s Chambers, the grant of legal aid by the Government so that he or she may engage lawyers, or through lawyers engaged by his or her school."
cybersecurity incidents involving government websites,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Communications and Information in view of the hundreds of malware-infected sites including Government portals (a) whether any critical Singapore sites or servers have been compromised; and (b) what are the measures that the public should undertake to prevent such incidents.,"Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim: I believe the Member is referring to the recent report by INTERPOL's Global Complex for Innovation, which was developed together with the Singapore Police Force (SPF) and other partners in 2017.INTERPOL assessed the vulnerability of servers and websites in ASEAN member states, and discovered nearly 9,000 compromised servers and hundreds of malware-infected websites. This included around 130 servers and websites reported to be in Singapore. Upon further investigation by the Cyber Security Agency (CSA) and the SPF, the majority of these 130 servers and websites were found to be clean. Some of the infected machines included phishing websites and Command and Control Servers – machines that were issuing commands to other compromised devices. No critical Singapore servers or websites were found to be compromised.Cyber threats are increasing, and there are malicious actors out there who seek to harm others via cyber means. The Government is not spared from this threat, with our IT network constantly under attack. Therefore, we cannot be complacent. The Government is strengthening our cybersecurity, including by passing a Cybersecurity Bill later this year, and raising public awareness through roadshows by CSA and SPF. The Infocommunications Media Development Authority (IMDA) will also help SMEs strengthen their cybersecurity under the SMEs Go Digital programme.We urge organisations, companies and the public to work with us on this shared effort. Businesses should take advantage of the many programmes we have to strengthen cybersecurity, and ensure that their electronic networks are secure against hacks. Individuals can take simple steps such as by changing the default passwords of their routers and Internet-connected devices. More detailed information is available on the GoSafeOnline website at www.csa.gov.sg/gosafeonline run by the Cyber Security Awareness Alliance (CSAA).Together, we can create a safer and more secure cyberspace for Singapore."
applications for shelter for the homeless,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Social and Family Development in 2016 (a) what is the most common reason for rejecting an application to provide shelter to homeless people; and (b) what is the waiting time for placement at a shelter.,"Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: MSF works closely with Government and community agencies, such as HDB and social service agencies to assist homeless families and individuals in need. Some of them may seek help from Family Service Centres to identify temporary housing options and address their other needs. Those who have exhausted all means of accommodation and are in need of immediate shelter would be admitted into Transitional Shelters. Caseworkers at the shelters and social workers at the Family Service Centres will work with these families to improve their family situation, coordinate relevant assistance, and secure long-term housing options.In some cases, persons seeking admission into Transitional Shelters have alternative accommodation options with family and friends and are therefore not admitted to the shelter. There are also individuals who are not suitable to be admitted into Transitional Shelters due to their physical or mental health conditions. The social service agencies will refer them to the appropriate care facilities.The waiting time for admission to the transitional shelters is typically about three days to a week. The time needed depends on factors such as whether the social worker is able to contact the client to undertake the assessment. For needy persons who need immediate shelter, the shelter operators will facilitate same-day admissions as far as possible. When same-day admission is not possible, such as during weekends and after office hours, the social worker will work with the person to source for interim accommodation, such as staying with relatives or friends. The women and children of families who cannot find interim accommodation can be admitted temporarily to the crisis shelters.The public and community can play a role by approaching persons in need to understand their circumstances and offer help. They can also call the ComCare hotline or approach the nearest Social Service Office or Family Service Centre for assistance. MSF and our partners in the community will continue to render assistance where needed."
rationale for pricing of polytechnic students' concessionary passes,"Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the rationale for pricing the concessionary passes for polytechnic students at $27.50 for bus, $25 for trains and $51 for hybrid of bus and trains; and (b) whether the pricing is reasonable for polytechnic students who need to take trains for the main journey but need only a short bus ride to reach the destination having to pay almost double for the hybrid pass.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Single-mode passes are special concessions for students and national servicemen who take only buses or only trains for their travel. The reference point for hybrid passes should not be the prices of single-mode passes, but the prices of Monthly Concession Passes for other commuter groups. In this regard, the price of a hybrid pass for polytechnic students is set to be the same as that for secondary, ITE, and junior college students, and is less than half the price of an Adult Monthly Travel Pass."
take-up rate for screen for life programme,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Health with regard to the Screen for Life programme (a) what are the percentages of eligible Singaporeans who have gone for screening, by gender and age ranges; (b) what is the drop-off rate of those tested positive and do not follow up for post-screening consultation; and (c) how is the need for post-screening consultation assessed for the enhanced programme.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Prevention is a key strategy in our war on diabetes. Besides healthy eating and frequent exercise, it is also important for Singaporeans to go for regular health screening.Based on the 2016 Health Behaviour Surveillance of Singapore survey conducted by the Health Promotion Board, 78% of Singaporeans aged 40 to 69 years had gone for basic health screening in the past three years for high blood pressure, high blood lipids and diabetes. This was an improvement from the 73% in 2010. There was no significant difference by gender. Older Singaporeans are more likely to go for chronic disease screening than their younger cohorts. Among those who have abnormal screening results, a significant proportion do not follow up to see a doctor.The need for post-screening consultation is assessed based on factors like the health screening results, as well as individual and family risk factors.MOH is enhancing our health screening programmes to achieve two objectives. First, we want to encourage more Singaporeans who meet the age and risk criteria to go for screening. Next, we want to encourage those who receive abnormal screening results, for example those who are tested positive for diabetes or who are pre-diabetic, to follow up to see a doctor.Ultimately, each person has to decide whether he or she wants to go for health screening and the follow-up consultation. While the government will provide support and encouragement, individuals must also take responsibility for their own health."
failure to give way to emergency vehicles,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) for each year in the past three years, how many people have been fined or prosecuted in court respectively for failing to give way to emergency vehicles; and (b) whether the Ministry intends to review the penalties for such offences.","Mr K Shanmugam: The vast majority of motorists do give way to emergency vehicles. Only a very small number of motorists fail to do so. From 2014 to 2016, a total of 22 drivers were issued composition fines for failing to give way to emergency vehicles; no driver was charged in Court.The Traffic Police (TP) will take action against motorists who fail to give way to emergency vehicles, because such behaviour may have serious consequences for people who critically need help. Offenders will be given four demerit points and a composition fine. We will prosecute offenders in Court if there are aggravating factors. Upon conviction, there can be a fine not exceeding $1,000 or an imprisonment term not exceeding three months for offenders charged for the first time. The maximum fine and imprisonment term could be increased to $2,000 and six months respectively, for subsequent charges which result in court appearances. My Ministry has no plans to review the penalties, as they are adequate for now.It is also important to raise public awareness of the importance of giving way to emergency vehicles. SCDF has worked with LTA to display ""Give way to emergency vehicles"" messages on electronic signboards located along expressways and major roads. Similar messages have also been printed on decals given out to motorists at petrol kiosks. We will continue to sustain such public education and outreach efforts."
effectiveness of telemedicine programme,Ms Sun Xueling asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the percentage of follow-up consultations that can be migrated to the national telemedicine consultation framework; (b) what are the criteria to determine what ailments can be addressed via tele-consultations while not lowering standards of patient care; and (c) what is the expected percentage of cost savings that can be achieved for hospitals and patients with such a move.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Smart Health Video Consultation (VC) initiative was introduced in our public healthcare institutions last November. The practice is evolving.Our chief considerations are patient safety. Clinicians would assess individual patient’s suitability before offering the option.For a start, VC has been introduced in psychiatric counselling, paediatric eczema pharmacy follow-up consultation, paediatric home care service, lactation consultation, speech therapy, post-stroke, communicable disease, and cancer patient care. These are also areas where it has been found to work well overseas.Early indications show that it is bringing about greater productivity and convenience for patients. It is still too early to assess the likely extent of adoption and the impact on cost savings. We will continue to monitor its rollout and encourage greater adoption."
lease extension under parenthood provisional housing scheme,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for National Development whether flexibility can be exercised in extending the lease for families under the Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme (PPHS) whose BTO flats are due to be completed within three to six months of their expiring PPHS lease.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme (PPHS) provides an affordable rental housing option for families who require interim housing while they await the completion of their new flats. PPHS rental flats are mostly vacated flats under the Selective En Bloc Redevelopment Scheme, which have been put to interim use before they are demolished when required for redevelopment.If the PPHS tenant's new flat is not ready when their tenancy term ends, HDB will be flexible and extend the tenancy provided the PPHS site is not due for immediate clearance. Due to upcoming redevelopment plans, it is not possible to extend the tenancies beyond the PPHS site expiry date.When choosing a suitable PPHS flat, families are informed of the availability period of each PPHS site and advised to select one that best meets the completion timelines of their new flat. After the tenants have moved in, HDB also sends regular reminders ahead of the site expiry date, to give them sufficient time to plan for their housing options.For families affected by site expiry, HDB will help them to transfer to other available PPHS flats."
rationale for pricing of polytechnic students' concessionary passes,"Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the rationale for pricing the concessionary passes for polytechnic students at $27.50 for bus, $25 for trains and $51 for hybrid of bus and trains; and (b) whether the pricing is reasonable for polytechnic students who need to take trains for the main journey but need only a short bus ride to reach the destination having to pay almost double for the hybrid pass.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Single-mode passes are special concessions for students and national servicemen who take only buses or only trains for their travel. The reference point for hybrid passes should not be the prices of single-mode passes, but the prices of Monthly Concession Passes for other commuter groups. In this regard, the price of a hybrid pass for polytechnic students is set to be the same as that for secondary, ITE, and junior college students, and is less than half the price of an Adult Monthly Travel Pass."
sheltered walkways from schools to bus-stops and mrt stations,Mr Darryl David asked the Minister for Transport whether LTA can work with all schools and institutions to provide sheltered walkways along the shortest possible route to bus-stops and MRT stations to enhance last-mile connectivity.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Today, 80% of schools already have covered linkways to an MRT station within 400 metres or an LRT station, bus interchange or bus stop within 200 metres. These linkways are built along the most practical path. The remaining schools will have covered linkways by 2018, if they fall within the Walk2Ride criteria."
"progress of 'teach less, learn more' policy","Ms Chia Yong Yong asked the Minister for Education (Schools) (a) what has been the progress on the ""Teach Less, Learn More"" policy since its implementation in 2005; and (b) in light of students continuing to have heavy schoolwork, how will the Ministry review and implement that policy.","Mr Ng Chee Meng: The 'Teach Less, Learn More' movement was launched in 2005 to encourage our teachers to adopt a range of effective teaching approaches to engage students and enable them to develop enduring knowledge and skills for life. More classroom time was given for student interaction and exploration, opportunities for expression, and learning of life-long skills.An evaluation of schools’ efforts in 'Teach Less, Learn More' showed that students were more engaged in learning, teachers were more reflective in their practice, and schools had developed a culture of innovation.Similar observations were made from international benchmarking studies. In Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2015, our Primary 4 and Secondary 2 students responded that they like Mathematics and Science, and that their teachers are good at explaining concepts. Similarly, for PISA 2015, more than 80% of the Secondary 3 students indicated that they have fun when learning Science, and enjoy acquiring new knowledge in Science.MOE is committed to continue making learning meaningful and engaging for our students. Teachers will also need time to become more skilful in designing and implementing more inquiry-based and applied learning experiences.To support these efforts, MOE monitors and regularly reviews the students' curriculum load and time. As part of the regular syllabus reviews, we elicit feedback from teachers and students to ensure that the curriculum load is manageable. Curriculum content has been reduced by 30% on average across subjects since 2005 to ensure the curriculum load is manageable. MOE and schools will also continue to monitor the implementation of its homework policy, keeping in mind the need to ensure that the amount of homework given is appropriate, meeting the needs of students, and enabling them to have adequate time for family bonding, rest, and to pursue personal interests and hobbies.We will work with schools to strengthen teaching and learning practices so that students continue to experience the joy of learning."
tapping global market for specialist skills for digitalisation and innovation growth strategies,"Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for Manpower whether countries who have tightened their work visa schemes have presented Singapore with more opportunities to tap the global market for talent, particularly specialist skills to jumpstart our digitalisation and innovation growth strategies.","Mr Lim Swee Say: No country, no matter how large its domestic talent pool, can rely on local expertise and experience alone to stay at the forefront of technology and innovation. This is true even for leading economies such as the US, and Singapore is no exception. We need to tap on global expertise to strengthen our competitive position in emerging growth areas such as digital technology. However, in doing so, we must ensure that this will strengthen our Singaporean core over time, rather than weaken it.Panasonic is an example of a company that has done this well. It has just moved the global headquarters for its refrigeration compressor business from Japan to Singapore. At the same time, Panasonic is upgrading its Singapore R&D centre, and has embarked on a multi-year effort to transform the Singapore manufacturing plant into a digitally-enabled Smart Factory that enables more manpower-lean and efficient manufacturing processes. To support the transformation, Panasonic is creating training opportunities to build local expertise and strengthen Singaporeans' skillsets. These include mentorship by experienced seniors, on-the-job training and robotics courses. Panasonic plans to bring in smart manufacturing experts from Japan to help in the transformation of the Singapore plant, so that in time to come, we will have stronger local expertise in smart manufacturing.In summary, we must continually upgrade the local workforce, even as we remain open to global expertise, so that we will have a strong Singaporean core at the heart of a vibrant economy."
applications for extension of lease period for residential properties,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Law (a) how many applications have been received and approved for the extension of the lease period for residential property owners to reinstate the lease to 99 years; (b) how many of them have a balance lease of 50 or 60 years prior to the application; and (c) how does the Land office compute the land rent for these applicants and whether such computation will be reviewed periodically.,"Mr K Shanmugam: Generally, land will revert to Government upon expiry of a lease. The land will then be re-allocated, in accordance with planning guidelines, for other land use needs, for example for more intensified use.Nevertheless, the Government will consider the renewal of State leases on a case-by-case basis if they are in line with planning intention and help to further specific economic and social objectives.Since 2008, the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) has granted renewals to seven residential developments and the leases were topped up to 99 years. In all seven cases, the renewal of the leases was necessary to facilitate the redevelopment and intensification of the residential land parcels in question.If the Government decides that a lease renewal can be granted, the property owner will have to pay a lease renewal premium upfront in order to effect the lease renewal. The lease renewal premium is assessed by the Chief Valuer's Office based on the prevailing market value at the point of renewal."
number of electoral divisions taken care of by each hdb branch,"Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the average number of electoral divisions that each HDB Branch is responsible for; and (b) with the increasing number of development and upgrading projects in the HDB heartlands, whether the resources at each HDB Branch are sufficient to manage the workload in a timely and efficient manner.","Mr Lawrence Wong: There are currently 21 HDB Branches across Singapore, which provide a range of services to the residents. There is no one-to-one mapping of the electoral division boundaries and the location of HDB Branches. Depending on location, each HDB Branch typically serves a number of electoral divisions, and residents within the same electoral division might be served by different HDB Branches. On average, each Branch is responsible for HDB developments in about three electoral divisions.HDB manages the manpower resources of its Branches according to the number and profile of the HDB developments that each Branch manages, and may reallocate resources across Branches if required. To optimise resources, HDB has implemented a number of self-help options to allow residents to obtain information quickly, and to conduct straightforward transactions via online channels. HDB has been reaching out to educate the public on the various electronic and mobile services available.HDB will continue to review its resources, streamline its processes and leverage technology to enhance operational efficiency and ensure timely delivery of services to the residents."
review of offences to allow for community sentences or probation as sentencing options,Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Law whether a review of offences punishable by mandatory or specified minimum sentences will be carried out to identify suitable offences for which community sentences or probation should be provided as sentencing options.,"Mr K Shanmugam: Community-based sentences (CBS) were first introduced as part of the amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code in 2010, to provide the Courts with greater flexibility in sentencing.During the Second Reading in 2010, I had explained that CBS targets offences and offenders traditionally viewed by the Courts to suitable for the rehabilitation end of the spectrum. These include regulatory offences, offences involving younger accused persons and persons with specific and minor mental conditions.We have gained experience from the administration of CBS these past few years, and are now reviewing the regime to see how it can be enhanced and refined. A core aspect of this review is the eligibility criteria of CBS, and whether it can be made available for more types of offences. Details of the review will be announced in due course.However, we do not intend to extend CBS to offences with mandatory or specified minimum sentences. As CBS is intended primarily for more minor offences, it would not be suitable for offences which Parliament had considered serious enough for mandatory or specified minimum sentences to be imposed."
age restriction for private security officer's licence applicants,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether the Ministry will consider allowing only persons aged 18 years and above to apply for the private security officer's licence.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The Police Licensing and Regulatory Department (PLRD) only allows persons aged 16 years and above to apply for a Security Officer's (SO) licence. This takes into consideration that under the Employment Act (EA), persons are no longer considered children or young persons, when they are aged 16 and above.Regardless of their age, all SOs must meet the same training standards before they can be deployed. They must be certified competent in two mandatory courses conducted by training organisations, accredited by SkillsFuture Singapore. These modules cover security skills and knowledge such as how to respond to suspicious persons, vehicles or activities when carrying out their duties. Assessments are conducted as part of their training to ensure that SOs are competent before they can be deployed.There are fewer than 10 active SOs below 18 years of age out of over 40,000 active SOs. To date, PLRD has not received any adverse feedback regarding SOs who are below 18 years of age."
primary one admission based on active community participation,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Education (Schools) for each Primary One registration exercise in 2015 and 2016 (a) how many children have gained admission under the priority for Primary One registration based on active community leadership by the child's parents; and (b) how many children have gained admission based on this priority for schools whose Primary One places have been entirely taken up by the end of Phase 2B except the bare minimum of 20 places left for Phase 2C and what percentage of the total places offered in these schools does this figure represent.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: Phase 2B of Primary One (P1) Registration is open to children of active community leaders, parent volunteers and endorsed members of religious groups or clans that are directly connected with the school.For the past two years, the proportion of children admitted in Phase 2B has remained constant at around 6% of the P1 cohort. The active community leader scheme formed less than 1% of the P1 cohort. The vast majority of Phase 2B places went to children of parent volunteers and endorsed members of religious groups or clans that are directly connected to the school.In the 2015 P1 Registration Exercise, all schools had more than 20 places available at Phase 2C. In the 2016 P1 Registration Exercise, all schools except one, had more than 20 places for Phase 2C. For the lone school that had 20 places for Phase 2C, 1% of its P1 cohort was admitted based on the active community leader scheme."
cpf education scheme for all approved educational institutions,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Minister for Manpower whether the CPF Education Scheme can be expanded to all programmes at approved educational institutions and not limited to only full-time subsidised diploma/degree courses.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: The primary purpose of CPF is to support retirement, healthcare, and housing needs. When the CPF was expanded to support education in 1989, it was designed as a loan scheme and confined to only firstly, full-time, secondly subsidised, and thirdly diploma and degree programmes offered by local approved educational institutions. Students have to repay in cash, the amount withdrawn plus interest into the CPF member’s Ordinary Account so as to restore members' CPF savings for their retirement needs. This cautious approach is to safeguard the fundamental objectives of the CPF.With increasing life expectancy, we are doing more to safeguard the retirement adequacy of CPF members. We need to be careful about expanding the use of CPF, including the proposal by the Member to include all programmes beyond full-time subsidised diplomas and degrees."
plans for human milk bank,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry can share more details about the human milk bank it is planning to establish,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The human milk bank is still in its planning stages. It is a partnership between Temasek Foundation Cares and KKH, and the bank is funded by Temasek Foundation Cares.My Ministry will share further details of the human milk bank when it is finalised later this year."
applications for employers to be exempted from compliance with employment act,Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for Manpower from 2007 to 2016 (inclusive) (a) how many applications has the Commissioner for Labour received from employers to be exempted from compliance with the Employment Act under section 41A of the Act; (b) how many employers have been granted such exemptions and from which industries do they come from; (c) what obligations have been exempted and on what justifications; and (d) what proportion of those granted exemptions have had repeat approvals.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: The Employment Act (EA) regulates the provision of rest days and public holidays, and prescribes limits to over-time work. Different rates of pay apply for over-time, rest days and public holidays. Also, working hours, including over-time, cannot exceed 12 hours a day, and on a monthly basis, over-time cannot exceed 72 hours.Section 41A of the EA provides the flexibility for the Commissioner for Labour to exempt companies from these requirements, after considering companies' operational needs as well as the workplace safety and interests of workers.Over-time limit exemptions are generally granted only to companies with unexpected short-term business needs. The main exception is the security industry for which a Tripartite Committee has been working to make more and better use of technology to become more manpower-efficient.As for exemptions related to over-time pay, rest days and public holidays, they are granted only to companies and industries with uneven and seasonal fluctuations in business demand. Such exempted companies are allowed to compute their workers' weekly working hours over a longer period to determine the eligibility for over-time pay, or to schedule their employees' rest days and public holidays in-lieu more flexibly over a longer period.Between 2007 and 2016, about 320 employers applied for over-time limit exemptions on average annually. Of this, 270 employers were granted exemptions each year. The companies were predominantly from the security, manufacturing, and transport and storage industries.Excluding security companies, about 20% of the companies which were granted over-time limit exemptions were also exempted in the preceding year.MOM has progressively tightened over-time limit exemptions. The maximum exemption period was shortened from two years to one year in 2012. Since then, employers who apply for repeat over-time limit exemptions are also required to submit their plans or measures implemented to reduce their reliance on these exemptions. As a result, approved over-time limit exemptions decreased by 60%, from 8,700 company-months in 2011 to 3,400 in 2016.On exemptions related to over-time pay, and flexible scheduling of rest days and public holidays in-lieu, MOM received an average of three to four applications annually in the last 10 years. About two-thirds were approved. They were predominantly event-management companies, or from the manufacturing and marine industries.In conclusion, while such exemptions provide flexibility to businesses, there are safeguards in place to ensure that workers’ interests are well protected. First, employers must obtain the written consent for the exemptions from all affected workers. Second, applications from employers with previous EA infringements and poor workplace safety records will be rejected. Third, the unions must agree to the exemptions, where applicable. Lastly, for safety reasons, over-time limit exemptions are not granted for high-risk vocations, such as those which involve operations of heavy machinery."
support for smes in succession planning and m&a advisory,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) what measures or schemes are there to (i) support business succession planning for SMEs and (ii) assist SME owners who are seeking to sell their business to locate investors as many SMEs are unable to engage conventional M&A advisory firms due to their small deal size.,"Mr S Iswaran: The Government has several initiatives to support SMEs in planning for business succession.First, SMEs which need assistance to develop business succession plans can tap on SPRING’s Capability Development Grant (CDG) to defray the costs of engaging external consultants. Areas which can be supported include the development of customised talent management programmes to address a company's specific needs, strategic priorities and leadership capabilities required.Second, to help SMEs strengthen their leadership capabilities, future leaders can attend leadership and management courses supported by SkillsFuture Singapore, such as the Leadership and People Management Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ) training programmes or the SSG-SMU NextGen Leadership Series. For exposure to key overseas markets or critical business functions, companies can tap on the SkillsFuture Leadership Development Initiative (LDI) to design leadership development roadmaps and implement relevant on-the-job leadership development opportunities.Third, SMEs looking to upgrade their talent management and succession planning capabilities can send their HR practitioners for Human Resource WSQ programmes offered by SkillsFuture Singapore through its CET Centres. The WSQ Specialist Diploma in Human Capital Management includes an elective unit on succession management.SPRING works with partners to educate and assist SMEs in mergers and acquisitions (M&A). To help SMEs understand the M&A process, connect them with potential buyers and find opportunities for collaboration, SPRING has partnered with organisations such as Singapore Exchange (SGX) and United Overseas Bank (UOB) to hold sharing sessions on M&A and networking events. Past events include the SME Financial Management Growth Seminar by SGX and SPRING, the UOB-SPRING M&A Seminar, and the Singapore Furniture Industries Council's Funding Seminar.SMEs looking to better understand the M&A process can also approach any of the 12 SME Centres for assistance. SMEs who are looking to embark on acquisition will need to formulate a strategy, identify suitable targets, and conduct due diligence and post-transaction integration. Companies which need support in these areas can tap on CDG to engage consultants with declared M&A expertise certified by one of the three certification bodies under SPRING's Consultant Quality Initiative."
impact of extension of non-smoking areas on number of offences,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) since the list of non-smoking areas was extended to include common corridors, void decks, sheltered linkways and parks, how many smokers have been caught for violating the non-smoking law; (b) what are the penalties imposed; and (c) whether the Ministry is stepping up its enforcement action.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: My Ministry's long term goal is to prohibit smoking in all public places except at designated smoking areas. This is to protect non-smokers from the harmful health effects of second-hand tobacco smoke.In 2013, the smoking prohibition was extended to sheltered walkways and linkways, and common areas within any residential premises or buildings, including common corridors, staircases and stairwells of HDB and private residential buildings. Last year, the smoking prohibition was extended to neighbourhood parks within residential estates and those under the purview of the Jurong Town Corporation. Those who are caught smoking in areas where smoking is prohibited are liable to a maximum court fine of $1,000.The National Environment Agency (NEA) conducts inspections and patrols to ensure compliance with the smoking prohibition. From 2013 to 2016, the NEA issued over 62,000 tickets for violations of the smoking prohibition at all prohibited places, with more than twice as many tickets issued in 2016 compared to 2013.My Ministry will continue to take enforcement actions against those who are caught smoking in smoking prohibited areas. However, as smoking is currently prohibited in more than 32,000 premises, it is not possible for the NEA to watch over every location where smoking is prohibited. It is also unrealistic for NEA to respond immediately to a reported incident of smoking in a prohibited place, for example, before the smoker finishes his cigarette. Operators and managers of premises are required to do their part to stop patrons from smoking in smoking prohibited areas and request patrons who smoke to leave the premises.I would like to urge all smokers to be considerate when smoking in public places and to smoke only in permitted areas so as not to cause disamenities to others."
extension of childcare centres' operating hours,Ms Sun Xueling asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what percentage of childcare centres currently operate beyond 7 pm and do not penalise parents for picking up children after 7 pm; and (b) whether the Ministry can encourage more childcare centres to operate till 8 pm as normal operating hours and not penalise parents for every 15 minutes beyond 7 pm.,"Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: To cater to the needs of working parents, childcare centres are required to operate full-day services from 7 am to 7 pm on weekdays, and from 7 am to 2 pm on Saturdays. Around 50 child centres (or about 4% of centres) operate beyond 7 pm on weekdays.Currently, childcare centres have the discretion to extend their services beyond the standard operating hours. To require them to do so will add to staffing requirements and result in higher fees to parents. We also do not monitor nor regulate how centres determine additional charges, if any, for late pickups, as these are commercial arrangements between centres and parents. In any case, if parents are unable to pick up their children on time, many of them arrange for other caregivers, such as grandparents and domestic helpers, to do so.While the Government is committed to enhance the provision of affordable and quality child care to support working parents, I would like to encourage parents to find suitable arrangements that help them to balance their work and family responsibilities. For most young children, parents are their first and best teachers. Spending quality time with children is important to provide a good start for their children.In this regard, I am pleased to note that more employers are adopting flexible work arrangements, such as more flexible start and end times, to help their employees better manage their family commitments."
entrance and exit points for schools,Mr Darryl David asked the Minister for Education (Schools) whether it is the practice for all schools and institutions to have more than one entrance/exit gate so that the school can still be accessed in case of an emergency when the main access point has been compromised.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: Most MOE schools are designed with two separate vehicular gates to allow the flow of vehicles into and out of the schools. These gates are used by emergency vehicles should the need arise.Some schools have only one vehicular gate for entry and exit because of localised site constraints such as proximity to external road turnings, external bus bay or a narrow school frontage. Here, the gate is designed to be wider to allow for two-way vehicular access.Our schools are designed with fire engine access road that comply with the requirements of the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF). In the event of an emergency, SCDF has the necessary capabilities to gain access to the school premises.All schools have at least two other pedestrian side gates which are typically segregated from the vehicular access gates.Should the main vehicular access point be blocked in an emergency, people can exit using these pedestrian side gates. Schools are also provided with emergency exit gates along the fence of the school field for evacuation during emergencies. These pedestrian and emergency gates do serve as alternative routes for emergency vehicles to approach.Schools and MOE continually review our emergency Standard Operating Procedures, including infrastructure provisions. They also conduct regular exercises to ensure that our schools are prepared for any emergency."

integration of edb and ie singapore for better alignment of planning and execution of economic strategies,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Trade) whether the Ministry will consider integrating EDB and IE Singapore so as to take a holistic approach of whole-of-value chain capabilities to review economic issues strategically that enhances integrated tactical and operational execution.,"Mr Lim Hng Kiang: The Government takes a holistic approach towards economic planning and development. As the Committee on the Future Economy (CFE) reaffirmed, close collaboration amongst Government agencies and partners is critical to implement our economic strategies effectively and create good jobs for Singaporeans.Economic agencies, including EDB and IE Singapore, have mutually complementary strategic functions. EDB focuses on bringing in investments and strengthening Singapore as a global hub for business, while IE Singapore focuses on growing trade and overseas investments by helping Singapore-based enterprises internationalise. These roles allow agencies to specialise and build deep expertise in their respective areas.We have in place various mechanisms to ensure close collaboration amongst agencies. How the Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) are being developed and implemented is a good example of inter-agency and stakeholder collaboration. Each ITM is led by one Government Agency, which spearheads efforts in coordinating across agencies and bringing together the different types of support available to meet the specific industry’s needs. The ITMs do not only identify strategies, they also bring together the stakeholders to jointly execute the strategies. For example, the ITM for the logistics sector was launched on 16 November 2016. While EDB is the lead agency coordinating the ITM, IE Singapore has also been keenly involved to develop and execute strategies to help our logistics firms internationalise, which includes leveraging specialised logistics handling capabilities to complement other sectors like food and healthcare.The overseas Singapore Centres introduced in Budget 2017 is another example. Each Centre will consolidate the overseas networks of economic agencies to create single points of contact in key markets. This offers a common touch-point to Singapore-based companies venturing into the specific market, while allowing each agency to offer their respective expertise based on the companies’ needs. Both EDB and IE Singapore are part of our global network of Singapore Centres, and help companies gain new market access and grow their businesses through their joint efforts.MTI will continue to review the structures, processes and operations of our economic agencies, to ensure that our companies are supported effectively."

safeguarding minimum void deck space for community use,"Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for National Development whether HDB will consider safeguarding a minimum void deck space in each precinct as common spaces for social uses and funding neighbourhood social amenities such as Senior Activity Centres, Senior Care Centres and Residents' Committees to be set up at standalone sites or at HDB-run neighbourhood shopping centres.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Generally, void deck space is common space for social use. Since 2014, HDB has enhanced such spaces by introducing the ""community living room"", which are designated communal areas at the void decks with two to three sets of tables and seats for residents to meet and chat. Residents can also use the precinct pavilions for larger activities such as block parties and community functions.For Social Communal Facilities, or SCFs, such as Senior Activity Centres, Senior Care Centres and childcare centres, HDB works closely with the relevant Ministries and agencies to integrate them with new public housing developments. The funding for the construction of such SCFs at void decks is provided by the respective Ministries and agencies.In cases where the need for SCFs is not yet established during the planning of new developments, HDB will safeguard space in areas such as the void decks or multi-storey car parks, so that SCFs can be provided subsequently when the need arises. The location, size and quantum of these safeguarded spaces depend on the size of the HDB precinct. In cases where such safeguarded spaces are not sufficient, HDB will work with other agencies to identify suitable space in the community, including at HDB neighbourhood centres."
directory of qualified subject teachers,Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Education (Schools) whether the Ministry can (i) set up a directory of qualified subject teachers for subjects not offered by the special education schools and (ii) monitor the interest amongst parents and children for such subjects with a view to introducing more subjects for these schools in the future.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: The Government-funded special education (SPED) schools collectively serve students with a range of disability profiles and learning needs. While most of the schools offer a customised SPED curriculum, a few offer the national curriculum similar to that offered in mainstream schools, leading to national certifications like the Primary School Leaving Examination, GCE 'N' and 'O' Level Examinations. Such SPED schools offer the requisite academic subjects in line with requirements of these examinations.These schools offer a good range of subjects to meet different student interests and to enable them to acquire knowledge and skills to take on future learning. The availability of subjects in these SPED schools is a considered one, driven by students’ interests and needs. In doing so, the schools will ensure there are adequate subject teachers to deliver the curriculum."
extension of taxi driver licence beyond age 75 for those who are fit,Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for Transport whether it will consider allowing taxi drivers over the age of 75 years who remain fit and healthy and who can pass annual assessments to have their vocational licences extended.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The physical and cognitive stress on taxi drivers is much more than that on private motorists, as they drive for long hours, and must constantly look for fares and respond to passengers. While the annual medical examination can test for visual, cognitive and driving impairment, it cannot adequately assess the effect of such stress and fatigue on the taxi driver. Hence we feel that an age limit is necessary, in the interests of passenger safety.This age limit had been raised from 70 years in the seventies, to 73 years in 2006, and further to 75 years in 2012. We will continue to periodically review the age limit, taking into account improvements in the general health and lifespan of the population."
non-citizen quota for subletting of flats,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for National Development with regard to the non-citizen quota for subletting of flats (a) how many HDB subletting applications have been rejected due to this quota for the past two years; and (b) whether there is any concession or priority given to subletting applications by flat owners who have non-citizen tenants who have been staying in the same HDB unit for many years.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The Non-Citizen (NC) quota for subletting of flats was implemented to prevent the formation of foreigner enclaves and to maintain the Singaporean character of our HDB heartlands. Once the quota for a block is reached, no further subletting applications, whether a new or renewal application, will be accepted.Tenants affected by the NC quota generally have no difficulty finding accommodation in other areas. Nevertheless, HDB exercises flexibility for a small number of cases to allow renewals of flat sublets to NC tenants when the quota is reached, including those who have been staying in the same flat for many years."
lower speed limits for roads with on-road cycling lanes,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether speed limits for motorised traffic on roads with on-road cycling lanes can be set lower as a safety measure; (b) whether users of personal mobility devices are allowed on such lanes; and (c) whether LTA will consider developing a comprehensive set of guidelines or rules for all users of such lanes.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The motor vehicle speed limit for Tanah Merah Coast Road is 70 km/h at most stretches, and 60 km/h at some locations for safety reasons. We will monitor the situation and make adjustments if necessary.Personal mobility devices are not allowed on the on-road cycling lanes, just as they are not allowed on roads.The traffic rules for bicycles using the on-road cycling lanes are the same as the existing rules for cycling on roads."
implementation of additional breaks between lessons for students,Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for Education (Schools) (a) how many schools have yet to implement the additional breaks between lessons for students; (b) what is the Ministry doing to assess the effectiveness of these breaks; and (c) whether any tweaking is required to get better results.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: 95% of all schools have implemented the additional break on top of recess. Students who have to stay back in school for afternoon programmes also have lunch breaks reasonably spaced from the recess break.The remaining 5% of schools have not implemented the meal breaks because their school days end by 1.30pm.As part of their on-going review process, schools gather feedback regularly from teachers, students and parents, and make changes to ensure that the additional break is beneficial. For example, based on feedback, some schools play music through the Public Address system to signal the start of the additional break for the entire school. Examples of healthy snacks are shared during assembly so that students know what they can bring for the additional break.MOE HQ and schools will continue to monitor the implementation of the snack breaks and ensure that student well-being is taken care of."
ensuring sufficient sleep for students,Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for Education (Schools) (a) how do schools monitor whether the primary and secondary school students are overloaded with homework which may deprive them of sufficient rest; and (b) how is the Ministry working with schools to encourage students to get sufficient sleep as recommended by the NurtureSG Taskforce.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: Every school has put in place a homework policy articulating the objectives of homework and how homework load is regulated. This policy is communicated to parents and students. Schools have implemented processes to monitor and coordinate homework load. One approach commonly used is to designate a homework board in every class that lists all the homework, tests and projects assigned. This helps teachers to be aware of the spread of homework given to the class, so that they can coordinate and adjust the workload and assignment deadlines where appropriate.To help students understand the importance of having sufficient sleep, primary schools teach good self-management and time management skills through the Form Teacher Guidance Period and good sleep habits through the PE curriculum. This is also reinforced through the secondary school curriculum."
extension of no-pay infant care leave to public healthcare institutions,"Ms K Thanaletchimi asked the Minister for Health whether the option of the additional four weeks of no-pay infant care leave that will be introduced for public sector employees will be extended to all public healthcare institutions and, if not, when will this be rolled out to these institutions.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: From July 2017, Government Ministries and Statutory Boards will conduct a three-year pilot to test the viability of providing an additional four weeks of unpaid infant care leave to their employees who wish to apply for such leave. The purpose of the pilot is to assess whether it is feasible to extend this arrangement to other organisations in future.As public healthcare institutions are separate from Government Ministries and Statutory Boards, they are not part of the pilot. We encourage our public healthcare institutions to discuss with the Unions on the feasibility of having this arrangement for their employees."
auto-deduction of toll charges for vehicles at causeway and tuas checkpoints,Mr Yee Chia Hsing asked the Minister for Transport whether auto-deduction of toll charges at the Causeway/Tuas checkpoints can be implemented in place of the current system which requires manual insertion of a cash card.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: To enable automatic deduction of tolls for Singapore vehicles at the land checkpoints today, we will need to install substantial physical infrastructure similar to what is used for Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) or car park charging. However, we will be replacing the existing ERP system, which is becoming obsolete, by 2020, with a next-generation system that is based on satellite navigation technology and does not require physical gantries. We can then provide for automatic deduction with much less investment in physical infrastructure."
rain shelters for motorcyclists,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the total number of dedicated rain shelters for motorcyclists along our expressways; (b) what measures are in place to ensure that these places are safe for motorcyclists when they seek shelter during rain; and (c) whether the Ministry can consider building more dedicated rain shelters for motorcyclists other than those found below overhead bridges.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: There are 80 dedicated rain shelters for motorcyclists along expressways. They are located under flyovers, and are segregated from the main carriageway by vehicle impact guardrails, concrete safety barriers or spring loaded poles. There are also warning signs about 40 metres before each shelter to alert drivers and motorcyclists.We will provide more rain shelters where feasible."
motor insurance payouts from accidents involving foreign motorists,"Dr Tan Wu Meng asked the Minister for Transport in the last three years, how many local motorists have successfully claimed insurance payouts from foreign motorists for (i) personal injury and (ii) vehicle damage arising from vehicle accidents within Singapore.",Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Insurance claims are private transactions and we do not have access to the data. We understand that the General Insurance Association of Singapore will assist local motorists in claims against Malaysian insurance companies. We have received very few complaints on this issue.
lifts in schools,"Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Education (Schools) (a) what is the current number of Government primary and secondary schools with lifts; and (b) whether there are plans to install lifts in all schools for barrier-free access for staff, outsourced workers and vendors.","Mr Ng Chee Meng: MOE includes barrier-free accessibility enhancements, including lifts, whenever new schools are built or existing schools undergo major upgrading. About 70% of our Government primary and secondary schools are currently fitted with lifts. The remaining schools will be provided with lifts when they undergo major upgrading."
government support for efforts to enhance women representation at leadership positions,Ms Sun Xueling asked the Minister for Social and Family Development how can the Government better support the work of the Diversity Action Committee which looks at enabling women leadership and increasing the representation of women directors on boards of Singapore companies.,"Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: In recent years, many people have spoken about the importance and benefits of having more women on boards and in senior management. They include key private sectors players, regulators, as well as senior Government leaders like Madam Speaker, Minister Grace Fu, and Minister Shanmugam. Indeed, it is already widely known that having more women on boards adds to the board’s diversity in skill sets, experiences and perspectives, leading to better decisions. However, while there has been some progress on this front, more needs to be done to quicken the pace of change.I would thus like to thank Ms Sun for her timely question on how the Government can better support the work of the Diversity Action Committee, or DAC for short. MSF set up the DAC in August 2014 to build up women’s representation on boards of companies in Singapore. It comprises illustrious business leaders and professionals from the private, people and public sectors.I received DAC’s end-of-term report and next step recommendations in October last year. One of the recommendations was to strengthen MAS’ Code of Corporate Governance (CG Code) to require listed companies to disclose their diversity policy (including gender) and their progress towards achieving the objectives. MAS has formed a Corporate Governance Council to review the CG Code. The Council will consider DAC’s recommendation as part of its review.While the Government continues to encourage the inclusion of qualified women in executive development pipelines, companies have an equally important role to play. We urge companies to rely less on personal networks when searching for board candidates and look at widening their board search criteria. Companies must adopt best practices for board nomination and appointments, and also proactively incorporate board training in their talent development programme. Private sector leaders should volunteer to mentor and sponsor aspiring women leaders, who should be encouraged to step up and take up available board positions.The Government and private sector have to work hand in hand with the DAC to build up women’s representation on the boards of Singapore companies."
baseline functionalities in design of hdb estates,"Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for National Development (a) in the design of new HDB estates, whether there are any baseline functionalities defined to ensure adequate sheltered link ways; (b) whether HDB undertakes the design of new estates in-house or subcontracts the work to a panel of architects and consultants; (c) whether HDB has any system to track design compliance similar to the comprehensive management system to track the construction process of BTO projects; and (d) whether HDB assigns design works to architects and consultants based on cost or design considerations.","Mr Lawrence Wong: In all new public housing developments, HDB provides a network of covered linkways to connect the residential blocks with precinct amenities such as multi-storey car parks, nearby bus stops and precinct pavilions. Where the adjacent precinct has existing commercial or community facilities, HDB will also extend the network to link the new precinct with the existing developments. However, the covered linkway network may not always adopt the most direct route as there is a need to balance the provision of sheltered linkways with the aesthetics of the estate.HDB engages private consultants to design and supervise the construction of the majority of its housing projects. This includes the design and construction of estate facilities, such as linkways. To do so, HDB adopts the Quality-Fee Method (QFM), which is an established competitive selection method for tendering of consultancy services in the public sector. Apart from price, the QFM also takes into consideration quality of the consultants, including track record of consultants, quality of the design proposals where required, and the consultants' productivity records. These quality criteria are weighted more heavily than price during tender evaluation.Thereafter, HDB has a quality management system in place to ensure that consultants comply with HDB’s design guidelines. HDB also carries out reviews and technical audits at various design stages, before launching the projects for construction. Upon construction, if there is a need to rectify any serious design shortfalls, HDB will work with its consultants and contractors to undertake the necessary works."
improving safety of motorcyclists and pillion riders,Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Home Affairs what further measures does the Traffic Police intend to implement to enhance the safety of motorcyclists and their pillion riders using our roads.,"Mr K Shanmugam: Traffic Police (TP) will continue to adopt a three-pronged approach of Enforcement, Education and Engagement to enhance road safety for motorcyclists.On enforcement, TP will continue to detect and deter offences, such as dangerous driving or riding, red-light running and speeding. Over the next two to three years, it will grow its network of traffic cameras, with additional red-light cameras to be installed in accident-prone junctions.Next year, TP will deploy Average Speed Cameras. These cameras are able to compute the average speed of a vehicle as it enters and exits an enforcement zone. They will ensure that motorists drive at safe speeds along entire stretches of roads.However, enforcement is not enough. Motorcyclists must also be alert to the dangers on the roads, ride safely and look out for their own safety. TP will continue to educate and engage them to raise awareness.Learner motorcyclists are taught safe defensive riding techniques at driving schools. This helps them to avoid accidents and injuries.TP has stepped up its efforts to raise awareness of road safety amongst the motorcycling community. Such outreach efforts need to be sustained, and will remain a key priority for TP in the years ahead. TP has made use of engagement platforms such as ""Singapore Ride Safe"" to encourage motorcyclists to wear personal protective equipment when they ride. In 2016, food delivery companies such as Food Panda and Domino’s Pizza purchased riding jackets for their delivery riders. TP has also collaborated with other companies such as PSA Corporation to provide safe-riding advisories to their riders.TP will continue its efforts to enhance safety on our roads. All road-users have a part to play. Drivers must follow traffic rules and actively look out for motorcyclists. Motorcyclists must do likewise, exercise care and take responsibility for their own safety and the safety of their pillion riders."
incidents of public disorder at night entertainment clubs,"Assoc Prof Randolph Tan asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether police powers can be increased to enable more stringent enforcement to prevent incidents of public disorder at night clubs, bars and similar establishments.","Mr K Shanmugam: Nightclubs, bars and similar nightlife establishments are regulated and licensed by the Police under the Public Entertainments and Meetings Act (PEMA). A key objective of the regulation is to maintain law and order, and public safety at public entertainment establishments. Licensing conditions may include the installation of CCTV cameras, prevention of overcrowding in the premises and obligations on operators to run the establishments responsibly. For example, operators are required to take all appropriate steps to prevent acts of violence and other crimes committed on premises.Police conduct compliance checks to enforce these licensing conditions. Licensees who breach the conditions can be charged under the PEMA and face a fine of up to $10,000 for each infringement. In addition, demerit points are awarded for these infringements. Licensees who accumulate a high number of demerit points will have their licences suspended or revoked. To enforce against errant public entertainment establishments, Police officers are empowered under the Act to enter and inspect establishments, conduct investigations and make arrests.MHA has completed a review of the PEMA, and the Public Entertainments and Meetings (Amendment) Bill was introduced earlier today. The amendments will enhance Police’s regulatory levers and powers. We will increase the penalty for providing public entertainment without a licence, strengthen the power to immediately suspend a licence where the licensee has been charged for serious offences committed on the premises, and empower Police officers to use force to enter establishments where they are prevented from entering. These amendments will enable Police to take even more targeted and calibrated enforcement actions to manage the risk of public disorder in such establishments."
industry knowledge for public officers negotiating free trade agreements,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Trade) whether public officers in charge of free trade agreements can be specialised in targeted industry sectors so that companies can directly approach them to get practical assistance for information and to resolve issues.,"Mr Lim Hng Kiang: The Ministry of Trade and Industry works with our economic agencies such as EDB and IE Singapore to raise awareness of our free trade agreements (FTAs) and to ensure that our companies can benefit from our FTAs. Trade negotiators from the Ministry and IE Singapore’s FTA promotion and advisory team regularly engage Trade Associations and Chambers (TACs) to help companies use FTAs.To illustrate, IE Singapore had conducted industry-specific workshops on the benefits of FTAs with the Textiles and Apparel Fashion Federation (TAFF) for the garment manufacturing industry, and with the Singapore Food Manufacturers’ Association (SFMA) and Singapore Manufacturers Association (SMA) for the food & beverage manufacturing industry in 2016. This year, IE Singapore plans to conduct industry-specific workshops for companies in the services sector. In addition, IE Singapore also conducts customised, one-to-one FTA consultations with companies.Over the last five years, around 3,500 companies have benefitted from workshops and seminars aimed at building greater awareness and knowledge of how FTAs can be utilised. An additional 2,000 companies have benefitted from one-to-one FTA consultations with IE Singapore. The beneficiaries of these efforts include local SMEs in diverse sectors that wish to capitalise on FTAs in penetrating export markets.Company feedback is integral to trade agreements, which are intended to help our businesses access foreign markets. MTI and our economic agencies will continue to engage our companies prior to the start of new FTAs, during negotiations and when we review existing FTAs, to ensure that these agreements stay relevant to the needs of our businesses in the various industries."
provision of natural gas supply to industrial estates,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) what is the progress in the provision of natural gas supply to all industrial estates to help industries reduce carbon emission.,"Mr S Iswaran: Since large-scale natural gas imports began in 2001, our natural and town gas networks have been expanding to meet growing demands from power plants and industry. Over the past ten years, PowerGas has extended our pipeline network by about 650 km, or about 23% of the entire network. The natural gas network today covers our industrial estates in western and northern Singapore, while the town gas network spans much of the island, including most of the remaining industrial estates. This will benefit industries that presently use more carbon-intensive fuels such as diesel. Only the Seletar industrial estate is not presently connected to either the natural gas or town gas networks. This is because the companies sited there are in the aviation and supporting industries, and presently do not require sufficient volumes of gas to justify extending the gas network there.As the development of the pipeline network is capital intensive, EMA will continue to extend the natural gas and town gas networks to serve areas where there is sustained gas demand growth. JTC will also factor in the utility needs of the industry (i.e. power, water, and gas) when planning for new industrial sites. This will assist to lower the last mile connectivity cost as a whole for companies.Besides switching to cleaner fuels such as natural gas to reduce their carbon emissions, companies can also utilise renewable energy such as solar power or implement energy efficiency measures. For instance, Apple had signed an agreement with local solar company Sunseap in 2015 to provide clean energy to power its entire Singapore operations. Companies can also tap on various energy efficiency grant schemes to improve their energy efficiency."
noise pollution summonses issued to malaysian motorcycles entering singapore,"Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) in the last two years, how many motorcycles entering Singapore from Malaysia have been issued summonses for emitting vehicle noise beyond permissible levels; (b) whether there are plans to step up enforcement actions especially at BKE areas for vehicles that emit loud vehicular noise and causing disturbances to housing estates near the expressway; and (c) whether there are plans to review and lower the level of permissible noise emitted by vehicles.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The National Environment Agency (NEA) regulates noise emission standards for new and existing vehicles. These standards are internationally benchmarked and are regularly reviewed. Vehicles to be registered for use on roads in Singapore are required to comply with the noise emission standards prescribed in the Environmental Protection and Management (Vehicular emissions) Regulations. Existing vehicles undergo mandatory periodic inspections, which include ensuring that the vehicles comply with the in-use noise emission standards. Passing the periodic inspection is needed for the renewal of the road tax.NEA and the Land Transport Authority (LTA) conduct joint enforcement blitzes against noisy vehicles. LTA takes action against the owners of motorcycles with illegal exhaust modifications, which are one of the main causes of excessive noise emissions. Since the beginning of 2016, 38 foreign motorcycles have been stopped by LTA for suspected illegal exhaust modifications. The owners of such foreign vehicles are referred to the Department of Environment in Malaysia, which will then notify them to send their vehicles for inspection and to rectify any illegal modifications before they are allowed to use their vehicles on the road. NEA and LTA take into account public feedback when deciding on the locations for enforcement blitzes, and they will look into the areas suggested by the Member."
regulation of use and storage of bicycles operated by bicycle-sharing companies,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Transport (a) what are the measures regulating the use and storage of bicycles operated by commercial bicycle-sharing companies; (b) what recourse do cyclists have when these bicycles take up their parking places; and (c) what recourse do residents and commercial entities have when such bicycles are left on their premises.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: In public spaces, shared bicycles are subject to the same parking rules as all other bicycles. They cannot be parked outside of bicycle parking racks and demarcated parking areas, as this may cause obstruction or inconvenience to the public.LTA has set up a feedback channel with bicycle-sharing operators to inform them to remove illegally-parked bicycles expeditiously. Members of the public who come across illegally-parked bicycles in public places can inform LTA, or the bicycle-sharing operators directly. LTA, together with other Government agencies, will strictly enforce against illegal parking. Enforcement action will include the impounding of bicycles and fines.The Government is also working to provide more bicycle parking in areas where there is shortfall. We have already begun introducing bicycle parking zones at seven MRT stations2. These are demarcated by yellow painted boxes on the ground, and are open to both privately-owned and shared bicycles. We intend to implement more such zones and also more bicycle parking racks at other public areas.As for private spaces including commercial and residential developments, the owners have the right to remove objects left on their property without permission. We would suggest that bicycle-sharing companies engage private development owners before operating bicycle-sharing services on their premises or making use of their bicycle parking."
community improvement projects committee funding for town councils,Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for National Development how much Community Improvement Projects Committee funding has been extended to each Town Council via their respective Citizens' Consultative Committees in FY 15/16.,"62 Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for National Development in the presentation of gazetted annual estimates by all Town Councils, whether there is a standardised way to present the quantum of Community Improvement Projects Committee funding for each Town Council under the head of Town Improvement and Project Funds.Mr Lawrence Wong: The Community Improvement Projects Committee (CIPC) provides funding support for improvement projects in HDB estates for the benefit of local residents. Such facilities include covered walkways, footpaths and playgrounds.CIPC funding is disbursed through the Citizens’ Consultative Committees (CCCs). This is because the CCCs are close to the ground and can identify projects which will be most useful for the residents to improve the living environment and strengthen bonds within the community. CIPC allocates its budget to the CCCs each year based on the number of HDB residential units. CCCs have the flexibility to prioritise projects based on local needs. Town Councils may approach their respective CCCs if they have any enquiries or proposals.As CCCs comprise community volunteers, they generally engage implementing agents to carry out the project works on their behalf. These agents can include the Town Councils, which are then reimbursed by the CCC for the cost of the works. Currently, MND does not prescribe any standardised way for Town Councils to present the quantum of funds received from the CCCs in their annual estimates."
personal mobility devices on buses and trains,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether personal mobility devices will be allowed on buses and trains permanently; (b) whether there have been any cases of denied access and what are the reasons for such cases; and (c) how can the first-and-last mile experience be further improved for users of personal mobility devices.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The trial to allow foldable bicycles and personal mobility devices (PMDs) on buses and trains at all hours began last December. This has been welcomed by cyclists and PMD users, and so far, there have not been significant negative reactions from other commuters. We will decide whether to make this arrangement permanent when the trial ends in May this year.In the last four months, there were about 70 reported instances where foldable bicycles or PMDs were not permitted to board the train or bus, largely because they exceeded the allowable dimensions.To improve the first and last mile experience for cyclists and PMD users, we will continue to widen footpaths where possible, and build more covered linkways, cycling paths and bicycle parking facilities."
challenges in applying for assistance under lean enterprise development scheme,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what are the key challenges encountered by companies in applying for assistance under the Lean Enterprise Development Scheme (LEDS); and (b) how can these issues be addressed.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: The three main challenges faced by firms in applying for LEDS assistance are lack of solutions, lack of scale, and lack of impact:First, lack of solutions Some firms can identify their problems, but have not found the solutions.We will help such firms by identifying and promoting more pre-qualified, ready-to-go solutions that can be quickly adopted to help companies become more productive. As shared in MOM’s Committee of Supply (COS) debate this year, there are 71 pre-qualified, ready-to-go solutions which can drive productivity improvement, skills development and innovation across various industries. Subsidies are made certain upfront for any firm adopting these ready-to-go solutions.The LED Taskforce will spread awareness of the pre-qualified solutions through the SME Centres and industry associations to showcase their solutions to companies.Second, lack of scale Some firms have a solution in mind, but they are unable to implement them as they lack the scale or volume.The LED agencies will help bring different firms that face similar issues together and help them find a common solution to transform as a cluster.Third, lack of impact Some firms have solutions, but their solutions lack impact. Their proposed plan only results in marginal improvements in productivity and in strengthening the Singaporean core.As these firms are committed to change, the LED agencies will guide and handhold them, to improve their plan to achieve stronger outcomes. The LED taskforce will then help with funding support, and if necessary, transitional manpower support, to implement their plans. Companies can get more information from industry associations, the SME Portal, or from any SME centres."
crime committed by foreigners,"Mr Darryl David asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) how many foreigners have committed criminal offences in the last year that have required them to be imprisoned; (b) how is this number compared with the previous years; and (c) what criminal offences will be deemed serious or heinous enough for the Government to revoke the immigration status of an offender, deport him from the country and bar him from re-entry, either indefinitely or for a specified period.","Mr K Shanmugam: Foreigners visiting or living in Singapore must abide by our laws. The Government takes a serious view against those who run afoul of our laws and will not hesitate to take them to task.The number of foreigners imprisoned for criminal convictions over the last five years has declined, from about 4,550 in 2012 to 2,750 in 2016. Of the foreigners sentenced to imprisonment in 2016, over a third were convicted of immigration-related offences. Foreigners made up 26.9% of all persons sentenced to imprisonment for criminal convictions in 2016. This proportion is less than the 30% of foreigners in our population. The number of foreigners imprisoned for offences, other than immigration offences, was 1,809. That is 17.7% of the total number of people sentenced to prison terms, compared with the 30% of foreigners in our population.The Immigration Act allows the Controller of Immigration to deem any foreigner who has been sentenced to imprisonment as an undesirable immigrant and cancel his immigration pass. Similarly, the Ministry of Manpower will revoke the work passes of foreigners who commit serious offences, and ban them permanently from employment in Singapore. These foreigners will be repatriated after they have served their sentences.The Immigration Act allows the Minister for Home Affairs to prohibit the entry and re-entry of a foreigner in the interests of public security. Foreigners who reoffended or are convicted of serious offences such as drug trafficking, violent crime, organised or syndicated crime, and immigration offences, and do not have family roots in Singapore will typically be prohibited from re-entry into Singapore."
eradicating gang-related activities,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) in the past three years, how many people have been arrested for gang-related activities; (b) what are the authorities doing to outlaw gangsterism; and (c) in light of gangs using social media to recruit youths, what is being done to identify and educate at-risk youths.","Mr K Shanmugam: The Singapore Police Force (SPF) closely monitors and controls the gang situation in Singapore through tough laws and strict enforcement.The number of rioting cases with secret society connotations is an indicator of the gang situation in Singapore. In the last three years, these rioting cases have declined from 62 cases in 2014 to 55 cases in 2015 and 52 cases in 2016. The number of gang-related rioting cases involving youths has also declined, from 21 cases in 2014 to 16 cases per year in 2015 and 2016.Beyond enforcement, the SPF also works closely with the Singapore Prison Service, MOE, MSF and Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs) to implement a range of preventive intervention and rehabilitative initiatives targeting at-risk youths.One key preventive initiative is the conduct of anti-gang talks, especially targeted at secondary school students, to discourage them from getting involved in street gang activities.Since 2008, the SPF has also been conducting training camps for youths to steer them away from crime or gang-related activities through team-based activities, self-reflection and sharing sessions by former gang members.In addition, youths detected to be involved in gang activities may also be diverted to the Streetwise Programme, which includes curfew hours and counselling sessions involving the youths and their parents.We will continue to keep a tight rein on gang activities in Singapore, including closely monitoring gang-related activities online."
causes for popping or cracking tiles in hdb flats,"Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for National Development (a) in the last two years, what has been the number of reports received on floor tiles popping up or cracking; (b) what are its causes; and (c) how can HDB assist flat owners to deal with the situation.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Tiles, like all fittings, fixtures and finishes in a flat, are subject to wear and tear over time. They may dislodge due to various reasons, such as differential thermal expansion and contraction of tiles, or the natural deterioration of the bond between the tiles and the screed surface. All these can cause a loss of adhesion between the tiles and the screed surface, and the dislodgement of tiles. In the past two years, HDB received about 2,000 cases of dislodged floor tiles per year. This works out to a nationwide yearly average of about two cases per 1,000 dwelling units, or 0.2% per year.Flat owners are responsible for the maintenance of their flats, including repairs for general wear and tear. In private developments, developers generally only rectify dislodged tiles during the 1-year Defect Liability Period (DLP). Some developers may offer repair for dislodged tiles for a slightly longer period, for example, three years, but those are generally done on a goodwill basis.HDB’s practice has been more generous – besides helping flat owners repair dislodged tiles originally provided by HDB during the 1-year DLP, it also offers goodwill repairs for dislodged tiles for up to 15 years. For flats that are older than 15 years of age, HDB will help carry out inspections and assist the owners to remove and dispose of the affected tiles. HDB can also provide owners with a list of registered repair contractors, whom they can then engage on a private basis."
complaints on dog owners failing to pick up after their pets,"Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) in the past three years, how many complaints have there been of dog owners who fail to pick up after their pets had defecated in public areas; (b) how can dog owners be encouraged not to let their pets urinate at the pillars in the void decks or the public park furniture; and (c) whether there was any enforcement action taken against these dog owners.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: All pet owners should clean up after their pets in public places. Members of the public who fail to clean up after their pets defecate in public areas can be fined up to $1,000 for the first offence under the Environmental Public Health (Public Cleansing) Regulations.Over the past three years, the National Environment Agency (NEA) has received more than 1,300 cases of feedback concerning faeces from pet dogs and stray dogs in public areas. As enforcement is challenging due to the transient nature of the offence, actions were only taken in four cases.The NEA, together with the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA), have been working with the Town Councils to undertake road shows and community events as well as distribute educational materials to educate pet owners to clean up after their pets. Standees are also placed at prominent locations where animal waste is an issue.Not cleaning up after one’s pet is irresponsible behaviour that dirties our environment. I urge all pet owners to be considerate and play your part in keeping Singapore clean."
tunnelling works that led to cave-in at bukit brown tomb,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Transport with regard to the ground cave-in at a historic tomb within Greater Bukit Brown (a) whether the contractor had knowledge of ground conditions and exercised adequate supervision of tunnelling operations; and (b) how does LTA ensure that machine operators are adequately trained and experienced to handle tunnelling in historic, ecologically-sensitive and built-up areas.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The localised depression was caused by a combination of mixed ground conditions and poor judgment on the part of the machine operator. The correct protocol, which the operator failed to follow, is to stop tunnelling and consult the on-site Tunnel Manager or Senior Tunnel Engineer. The errant operator has been replaced.Tunnel boring requires specialist skills. LTA only appoints machine operators with at least five years of experience. LTA also requires the contractor to conduct soil investigation before tunnelling to understand the ground conditions. Thus, depressions of such scale and magnitude are rare. Nevertheless, LTA will be enforcing even stricter controls and supervision going forward."
equipment for fitness corners at hdb estates,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for National Development (a) what are the criteria to determine what type of fitness corners and equipment are built in an HDB estate; (b) how many of the existing fitness corners are catered for national servicemen for their IPPT training; and (c) whether these equipment also cater to other residents such as the elderly, teenagers and children.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Since mid-2000s, new HDB developments have been provided with 3-Generation (3G) Family Playgrounds. Apart from play stations for children, these playgrounds also include a wide range of fitness stations which cater to adults and the elderly.For the adult fitness stations, HDB’s appointed consultants select equipment suitable for muscular and strength development. For the elderly fitness stations, the focus is on equipment which emphasise aerobic fitness and flexibility. All the equipment must comply with Singapore Standard 5342007, which specifies safety requirements for outdoor fitness equipment.As for the Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT), it currently comprises only the push-ups, sit-ups and a 2.4 km run. These exercises do not require any special equipment, and can be done at the fitness corners or even at home."
deployment of technicians at hdb car parks,Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the response time for the deployment of technicians to the incident site where there is a system breakdown at HDB carparks which implement the electronic parking system (EPS); (b) how reliable is the existing centralised response system; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider decentralising the response system as more HDB carparks are implemented with the EPS.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The management of HDB’s electronic parking system (EPS) car parks are decentralised to 10 different EPS service providers. Each service provider has a 24-hour call centre to provide assistance to motorists via the intercom installed at the entrance / exit gate of the car park.When feedback is received through the intercom, staff at the call centre will assess the situation, and a response officer will be deployed to the affected site if the system-related issue cannot be resolved remotely. For system-related issues, HDB’s contract agreements with the service providers stipulate that the response officer should reach the affected site within 10 minutes, under normal traffic and weather conditions. HDB can impose liquidated damages on service providers who fails to meet this requirement."
use of industrial premises for religious activities,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development if he will provide an update on the take-up rate of the non-exclusive and limited use of industrial premises for religious activities.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: In response to requests from religious organisations to allow some flexibility in the use of industrial space for religious purposes during factory downtime, URA introduced a set of guidelines allowing religious organisations to use industrial premises zoned Business 1 on a limited and non-exclusive basis. The predominant use of the premise must remain that of industrial activities, and the religious use must not alter the primary character and function of the industrial premises.Since the introduction of the guidelines in June 2012, 17 churches and two Taoist temples have been approved non-exclusive and limited use of industrial premises for religious activities."
proposed hawker centre in choa chu kang,Mr Alex Yam asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) when will plans for the proposed hawker centre in Choa Chu Kang town be finalised; and (b) where is it likely to be located.,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Choa Chu Kang is one of the towns identified for a new hawker centre by 2027. My Ministry is at the early stages of planning for this centre and we will provide more details of the location and timeline when the plans are ready.
investigation into accident in botanic garden where tembusu tree fell and killed a park visitor,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the progress of investigation by NParks on the incident at Botanic Gardens whereby a giant Tembusu tree fell and killed a park visitor and injuring several others; (b) whether NParks will consider increasing the frequency of inspection for trees above a certain age; and (c) what measures will be taken to prevent such similar incidents as Botanic Gardens is a popular outing place for locals and tourists.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The investigation into the Botanic Gardens incident is ongoing. There will be a Coroner’s Inquiry and NParks is providing the Police with the necessary information. In the meantime, NParks has completed detailed checks on all trees in and near the location of incident, as well as on large trees and other Heritage Trees throughout the Gardens as a precautionary measure. All these trees were found to be safe.All trees that NParks manages are regularly inspected. NParks continually strives to improve its inspection regime. Since 2012, they have inspected trees more frequently to adapt to increasingly unpredictable and severe weather conditions. Heritage trees are now inspected once in six months as opposed to once a year previously. For trees in areas with constant road or pedestrian traffic, they are now inspected once in six to 12 months, as opposed to once in 12-18 months previously. NParks further enhanced its inspection regime in November 2016 by instituting new second-level inspections for old and large3 trees. These detailed second-level inspections are conducted yearly with diagnostic equipment. To support its inspection regime, NParks has built up a pool of qualified arborists. Today, about 200 of the 500 Certified Arborists in Singapore are NParks’ staff.In addition to inspections, NParks has enhanced its tree maintenance regime to improve the resilience of its trees. First, regular application of fertilisers is now supplemented with routine mulching. This helps to conserve moisture and improve the fertility of the soil. Second, NParks has strengthened its tree pruning techniques to improve the structure and balance of its trees to help them withstand severe weather conditions. Crown reduction and pruning are undertaken prior to periods of severe weather.These measures have proven effective as the number of tree failure incidents have decreased more than three-fold, from around 3,000 in 2001 to 847 last year. That said, NParks will continue to improve its tree management measures. For example, NParks is developing modelling techniques to better understand the behaviour of trees under varying environmental conditions."
non-compliance to approved operating procedures at smrt,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Manpower with regard to SMRT's non-compliance with approved operating procedures since 2002 and till the fatal accident in March 2016 (a) whether the Ministry had inspected SMRT for workplace safety during this period; and (b) why did the system failures in management of workplace safety go undetected and uncorrected for so long.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: Every worker has the right to a safe and healthy workplace. We enacted the Workplace Safety and Health Act to ensure that safety and health risks to workers are eliminated or mitigated to as low as reasonably practicable. It holds employers and occupiers responsible for putting in place effective safety systems to ensure the safety and health of their workers.To enforce the Act, MOM takes a proactive and risk-based approach in our inspections. We focus on sectors with a high likelihood of an accident occurring, or where an accident could result in severe consequences. We target workplaces with activities that have recorded high number of injuries nationally. These inspections serve as deterrence against non-compliance and educate companies on the preventive measures. When an incident occurs, MOM investigates to determine the root causes and culpability of the companies and/or individuals involved. We take appropriate prosecution actions depending on the culpability of the offender and the extent of harm.In the case of SMRT, MOM conducted 10 workplace safety inspections at various train depots from 2002 to 2015. Our inspections focused on work-at-height activities and falling objects hazards, which were the main causes of workplace fatalities during that period. Following the March 2016 fatal accident, our investigation established that SMRT’s employees failed to comply with the established work procedures. We were also of the view that such failures could have been detected and remedied internally by SMRT if there was an effective system of safety checks and audits. This is why the Public Prosecutor pressed for a sentence commensurate with the seriousness of the case, and the Court fined SMRT $400,000. This is the highest fine ever imposed for a WSH violation.Safeguarding the safety and health of our workers must be the top priority of all businesses. Both employers and workers must take collective ownership of safety and health outcomes. Together, we can ensure our workers return home from work safe and healthy every single day."
contractors penalised for poor quality of home improvement programme works,"Dr Tan Wu Meng asked the Minister for National Development over the past three years, how many contractors have been penalised as a result of complaints received on the quality and workmanship of works done under the Home Improvement Programme.","Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB sets quality and service standards for contractors in the execution of Home Improvement Programme (HIP) projects. Based on surveys of precincts which have undergone HIP, at least 90% of residents express satisfaction with the works completed.Nonetheless, should there be any service or quality lapse, HDB will take enforcement action against the contractor. In the past three years, 19 contractors were penalised with demerit points. In addition, five of these contractors had an administrative charge imposed on them, and three contractors were restricted from tendering for HDB projects for a period of time."
number of events held at national stadium and indoor stadium,"Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) how many events have been held at the National Stadium and Indoor Stadium respectively in 2016; (b) how many events are expected to be held at the National Stadium and Indoor Stadium respectively in 2017; and (c) whether the number of event days at the National Stadium and Indoor Stadium meets the number promised by the Singapore Sports Hub Consortium when they were granted the contract.","Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: In 2016, 24 events were hosted at the National Stadium and 27 at the Singapore Indoor Stadium, while 2015 saw 18 and 31 events hosted at the two venues respectively. As discussions on the use of the venues are ongoing, we are unable to provide the numbers for 2017 now.More can and should be done by SHPL to enhance the vibrancy of the Sports Hub and improve the quality of its calendar of events and programming. To this end, SportSG is closely monitoring SHPL’s performance and is in regular communication with SHPL’s top management, to ensure that they remain accountable for the goals of the project and seek to maximise the value of the Sports Hub for Singaporeans."
diversity hr management policy at healthcare institutions,"Ms K Thanaletchimi asked the Minister for Health (a) whether healthcare institutions have a diversity management policy; (b) whether the staff are provided training to handle diversity issues; and (c) whether human resource personnel are well trained to manage workplace diversity practices in areas relating to age, race/culture, gender, nationality, religion, and people with disabilities.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: With their diverse groups of employees, public healthcare institutions (PHIs) recognise the importance of building inclusive and harmonious workplaces.PHIs provide training to HR staff and supervisors to work with employees from diverse backgrounds. Orientation programmes are organised for new employees which include modules on workplace culture and diversity. Social activities are also organised to encourage bonding amongst different groups of staff.Our institutions will continue to work with the Union and employees to regularly obtain feedback on how we can work together to further improve workplace diversity practices."
enhancing capabilities to care for children with autism,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) how is the Ministry enhancing the capabilities of caregivers and parents to care for children with autism; (b) how are pre-school teachers provided with the requisite training to teach children with mild autism; and (c) how can the community play a role in helping autistic children to learn.,"Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder may have needs that range from mild to severe. For those with moderate to severe needs, they are referred to the Early Intervention Programme for Infants and Children (EIPIC). EIPIC provides learning and therapy intervention for 0 to 6 year olds at risk of moderate to severe disabilities, including Autism. EIPIC services are currently available at 19 Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWO) centres located across Singapore.EIPIC centres train and involve parents and caregivers in the intervention for their child. This equips parents and caregivers to better care for their children with special needs, and the child also benefits when the intervention continues at home. In addition, children in EIPIC may also attend pre-school for education, inclusion and childcare. In such cases, the EIPIC centres will work with the child's pre-school teacher on strategies and tips on how best to engage the child in the classroom and in activities.The Ministry of Social and Family Development, with the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA), has worked with training institutes and educational providers such as Ngee Ann Polytechnic in rolling out specialised training such as the Specialist Diploma in Early Childhood Learning Support (SDELS), and the Advanced Diploma in Early Childhood Intervention (Special Needs) (ADESN), to equip EIPIC teachers, Learning Support Educators (LSEds) and classroom teachers in pre-schools with the necessary skills to support children with a range of developmental needs. Learning Support Educators provide targeted short-term intervention for children with mild developmental needs, and guide pre-school teachers in integrating these children in the classroom setting.The community has a crucial role to play in supporting children with special needs. Children with special needs should be accommodated in community activities and play settings, so that they can learn and grow together with typically developing children. The inclusive playgrounds in our community are a good example where accommodations enable interaction between children with special needs and their typically developing peers. Such inclusions pave the way for the community to become more open and supportive towards children with special needs and their caregivers.Corporate and individual contributions, coupled with a grant from the Care & Share Movement, were used to fund the five inclusive playgrounds built by NCSS. These playgrounds were the fruits of a very successful 3P (public, private and people) collaboration. We hope that there will be many more such partnerships and collaborations in building inclusive facilities, or creating inclusive settings.In the education system, the Ministry of Education seeks to enhance integration between students in mainstream and Special Education (SPED) schools by facilitating meaningful and purposeful interactions between these two groups of students. Under the MOE's satellite partnership model, some SPED schools practise 'social integration' with their mainstream partners. Others like Pathlight School allow their students to join their mainstream peers in class. The satellite partnerships enable students in SPED schools to remain integrated with the larger community.We will like to encourage corporates and community agencies and groups to actively create opportunities for better integration and inclusion of children with special needs, through the infrastructure or programmes they put in place, or the activities they organise. Our society can do more to enable these children, like any other child, to realise their true potential as they become integral members of society."
handling of arson attacks in mrt trains,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) how are the Home Team and public transport operators prepared to handle arson attacks in the MRT trains; (b) how can the public be involved to support Home Team's efforts; and (c) how can Singapore's readiness to respond to attacks in our public transport system be enhanced.,"Mr K Shanmugam: Our Home Team Departments and the Public Transport Operators (PTOs) are prepared to deal with emergencies in MRT trains, including fires. In the event of a fire, the automatic fire detection system in the train will be triggered to alert the station staff and the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF). There are established procedures to evacuate commuters to safety and to deal with different situations, regardless of whether the fire occurs when the train is at the station or on the tracks.Upon arrival, the SCDF will put out the fire, rescue and provide medical assistance to the injured, while the Police will maintain law and order. The Home Team Departments and the PTOs conduct regular exercises to validate and familiarise ground officers with such emergency response protocols.The cause of the fire may be deliberate. In the evening of 10 February 2017, a 60-year old man tried to hurl a lit Molotov cocktail into a packed Mass Transit Railway (MTR) train in Hong Kong. The incident resulted in injuries to commuters and disruption to the MTR's services.Arson attacks such as these, whether the act of a criminal or a terrorist, call for a heightened level of vigilance and preparedness. The Police formed the Public Transport Security Command (TransCom) in 2009 to conduct security patrols of our public transport system, including our MRT trains and stations. TransCom officers are trained to look out for suspicious persons and approach them for further checks. They are also the first line of response to any security incidents in the public transport system.The community plays an important role in our efforts to fight terrorism on a sustained basis. SGSecure was launched to sensitise, train and mobilise Singaporeans to play their part to prevent and deal with a terrorist attack. The Home Team has developed advisories and applications to equip and prepare our community in the event of an attack. These include(a) The ""Run, Hide, Tell"" advisory which guides the public on how to respond when an attack occurs.(b) The new SMS71999 platform to allow the public to SMS the Police if they see something suspicious.(c) The Police@SG app's i-Witness function which enables users to point, shoot and send information on major incidents and crime to support Police's investigation.(d) The ""Improvised First Aid Skills"" advisory which teaches the public how to use everyday items to help administer first aid to injured persons in the event of an attack.(e) The SG Secure E-learning package which allows the public to carry out e-learning at their own pace and pick up useful survival skills to stay vigilant, cohesive and resilient.Since the launch of the SGSecure movement, MHA has been working closely with the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and the PTOs to equip frontline staff with knowledge and skills to respond to a terror attack.The PTOs currently train some of their staff in first aid, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and the use of the automated external defibrillator (AED). The PTOs also support SGSecure's public awareness efforts by putting up relevant safety advisories, such as Run-Hide-Tell and Improvised First Aid Skills in MRT stations. Video messages that remind commuters to be vigilant are also broadcasted at the station platforms and in the trains.The Home Team will continue to work with the PTOs to build on the current training and outreach initiatives, including conducting exercises that enhance their preparedness in the event of a terror attack. One such example was Exercise Heartbeat which involved one of the PTOs conducted in September 2016 at Bishan Bus Interchange and Junction 8."
multi-lingual guide on appointing lasting power of attorney,Ms K Thanaletchimi asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) whether a simple guide in various languages has been produced to assist Singaporeans who are in need of a Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) to sign up for it; (b) whether a comparative study has been done on the extensiveness of Singaporeans seeking LPAs compared to other developed nations; and (c) what measures are there to safeguard the public from errant lawyers who facilitate LPAs.,"Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: Since the Mental Capacity Act (MCA) came into effect on 1 March 2010, the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) under my Ministry has made available various resources to guide interested individuals in making their LPAs. These include a guidebook on the LPA, guidebook for donees and a Step by Step Guide to completing the basic LPA form, which is supplemented by a video guide. Most of these resources are available in all four official languages. I encourage interested applicants to review these resources from the OPG website when preparing their LPA applications.As at 31 January 2017, 35,926 LPA applications have been received by the OPG, accounting for about 1% of the total Singaporeans and Permanent Residents population aged 21 and above.As Singapore's MCA is modelled after England and Wales, we looked at the United Kingdom for a quick comparison. In England and Wales, about 4% of their eligible population have made an enduring power of attorney or LPA. Similarly, about 3% of Scotland's population have done so. While these figures are higher than in Singapore, it should be noted that these jurisdictions started much earlier than us, some even as early as 1986.My Ministry recognises that we still have some way to go in getting more Singaporeans to plan ahead and make an LPA. Hence, I would like to reiterate that the application fee waiver for Singapore Citizens making an LPA Form 1 has been extended till 31 August 2018. We hope that more will take advantage of the fee waiver to pre-plan for ourselves and give our families peace of mind in future. We will also continue to increase awareness on the LPA.LPA certificate issuers, who are professionals from the medical and legal sector, perform an important safeguarding role in the whole process. The professional is required to see the donor and has to, in his professional opinion, ensure that the donor understands the purpose and content of the LPA, and that he is not forced to make one under pressure or duress. The certificate issuer does so by signing off on the LPA Form.OPG also takes a serious view of breaches made by certificate issuers and will not hesitate to bring them to Court or report them to their professional bodies if they do not conduct their duties in a proper manner. If anyone has knowledge that a certificate issuer had not carried out his duties properly, he may inform the OPG or alert the respective professional bodies so that the matter can be looked into."
medical chits from doctors not in company-assigned panel,"Ms K Thanaletchimi asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether all companies recognise medical chits from Singapore-registered doctors when an employee seeks medical care from clinics outside the companies' panel of doctors; (b) in the last three years, how many cases have been reported where an employer has deducted the salary of an employee when the medical chit is from a registered doctor who is not from the company's panel of doctors; and (c) how does the Ministry handle such cases.","Mr Lim Swee Say: Under the law, employers are to provide paid sick leave when an employee covered by the Employment Act is issued a medical certificate (MC) by a Government or company-approved doctor, and to bear the costs of the medical consultation. Notwithstanding this, many employers go beyond the statutory requirements by granting paid sick leave for MCs issued by any registered doctor.In the last three years, no cases of salary deductions related to unrecognised MCs have been filed in the Labour Court. There is no statutory or contractual breach in such cases. However, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has received a yearly average of about 15 queries of this nature. This number has not increased.Employers should ensure that their panel of approved doctors are accessible to their employees. Under extenuating circumstances, such as a medical emergency, employers are urged to exercise flexibility to provide paid sick leave when the employee seeks medical attention from a doctor who has not been approved by the company. Employees who require assistance can approach MOM, or the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management from April 2017."
crimes committed by persons who act on behalf of companies,"Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether the Ministry will consider introducing an offence for commercial organisations that fail to prevent the commission of economic crimes such as bribery, fraud and money laundering by persons who act on their behalf such as employees and contractors.","Mr K Shanmugam: Singapore takes a tough stance on economic crimes, such as bribery, fraud and money laundering. Our rates of economic crimes have been low. We are consistently ranked among the least corrupt countries.Commercial organisations, such as companies, are also liable under the law if they commit these economic crimes, or abet the commission of these offences by their employees, contractors, or any business partners. There have been cases in the past where companies were charged for such offences.The current legislative and regulatory levers we have to take action against errant companies are adequate. At this point, there is no need for a further specific provision to penalise a company for failing to prevent a crime from taking place, where the company did not commit and did not abet committing the crime.To ensure that companies adopt good corporate governance practices, the Companies Act imposes various obligations on company directors who provide stewardship of companies. In addition, the Code of Corporate Governance sets out corporate governance best practices for listed companies to comply with or explain any deviation from these practices."
bus regularity following implementation of bus service reliability framework,Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether bus regularity has improved following the implementation of the Bus Service Reliability Framework (BSRF); (b) how much incentives have been paid and how much penalties have been received; (c) what are the feedback received and whether commuters' travel experience have improved; and (d) whether there is a need to fine-tune the framework three years into its implementation.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The Bus Service Reliability Framework (BSRF) was introduced as a trial for 22 bus services in February 2014, and expanded to another 23 services in December 2015. We observed less bus bunching for these services. In the assessment period from December 2015 to August 2016, bus service regularity had improved for all 45 services. There was a 20% reduction in average additional wait times. A total of $3.4 million was paid out in incentives over this period, and no penalties.Based on the experience of the trial, we have tightened the baseline standard and decided to incorporate the BSRF within the bus contracting model. For 108 services for which we implemented BSRF from September 2016, we have observed a 15% reduction in average additional wait times. Any incentive or penalty will be paid out after a year's performance."
tree inspections and liability for damages related to falling trees,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether the regular inspections of trees are done by NParks staff or outsourced to a landscape company; and (b) whether the public liability insurance by NParks covers damages due to natural causes.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Trees under NParks' purview are regularly inspected by NParks’ Certified Arborists. Inspections are not outsourced to landscape companies. Beyond regular inspections, NParks prunes trees to make them more resistant to storms. NParks also substitutes storm-vulnerable species like the Albizia with hardier trees. This comprehensive tree management programme has been effective in reducing the number of tree incidents by more than three-fold since 2001.Having said that, trees can fall despite our best efforts. When accidents happen due to natural causes, NParks’ public liability insurance only covers claims where NParks is shown to be negligent. If NParks has exercised its duty of care in keeping to its tree management regime, the insurance will not pay out as NParks would not be culpable for circumstances beyond its control."
deciding between pedestrian overhead bridges and pedestrian crossing,Ms Sun Xueling asked the Minister for Transport what are the planning parameters to decide on where and when to build pedestrian overhead bridges and what are the cost-benefit considerations to decide between building a pedestrian crossing versus a pedestrian overhead bridge.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Our preference is to build at-grade crossings, rather than pedestrian overhead bridges, as they are barrier-free and more convenient for the elderly, families with strollers and persons with disabilities. However, there are instances where at-grade crossings are dangerous, for example, across major roads with fast-moving traffic, or may cause serious traffic congestion. In such cases, we will provide pedestrian overhead bridges."
strengthening bilateral relations with australia,"Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (a) what are some of our recent commercial investments with Australia; and (b) whether the Government intends to strengthen engagements with key Australian state governments with the objective of promoting bilateral business, trade and investment.","Mr S Iswaran: Australia and Singapore enjoy strong bilateral trade and investment ties. In 2015, Singapore’s stock of direct investments into Australia was S$34.9 billion, making Australia one of Singapore’s top 10 overseas investment destinations. Singapore companies have invested into diverse sectors including telecommunications, tourism, utilities and real estate. Our companies are also keen to explore opportunities in sectors such as agri-business.Australia continues to remain an attractive investment destination given its strong fundamentals. For example, last year, Surbana Jurong invested nearly S$400 million in Australian-based SMEC Holdings to form a global consultancy group specialising in urban and infrastructure development across countries in Asia, Australia, the Middle East, Africa and the Americas. Ascendas Reit also acquired properties in Sydney and Melbourne last year for A$168 million.Likewise, Singapore continues to attract Australian companies. One of the world’s largest integrated mining companies, BHP Billiton, has established its global headquarters in Singapore. Australia’s largest telecommunications company, Telstra, has its regional headquarters in Singapore from which it also funds start-up initiatives.We are continuing to strengthen bilateral ties with Australia at multiple levels. First, Singapore and Australia have elevated our bilateral ties to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. The Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA) was upgraded last year as part of the CSP negotiations. The upgraded SAFTA will help deepen commercial links and provide greater opportunities for bilateral exports and investments. We are working towards the ratification and implementation of the upgraded SAFTA this year.Second, we are working with the Australian government to launch an Australian ""landing pad"" in Singapore to facilitate access to investment, mentorship and strategic partnership for Australian high-tech start-ups. Singapore will be the fifth and final international location for the Australian government-promoted innovation ""landing pads"". The initiative will create opportunities for Australian entrepreneurs and Singapore companies to collaborate and do business in Asia, using Singapore as a base.Third, we have stepped up our engagement with Australia at the State level through IE Singapore and EDB. Our companies are regarded as credible partners to collaborate with the agri-business sector to grow the export of quality Australian products to Asia. For example, IE’s work with the Queensland State to introduce their growers to Singapore-based traders and cold-chain logistics companies has yielded a partnership between Australia’s Story Fresh and Singapore’s Indoguna for the export of leafy vegetables to Asia, including Singapore and Hong Kong. IE Singapore has also been working with the South Australian government and private enterprises to explore collaborations with Singapore’s food traders and logistics players.Singapore has also hosted visits to Singapore by many Australian State delegations. All six Australian states have established trade offices in Singapore which has helped to further strengthen bilateral ties at the national and state levels."
automation and robotics in hospitals,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Health (a) how has the progress of automation in our hospitals been in the last three years; (b) how prevalent is the use of robotics; and (c) what is the estimated increase in productivity.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: As Singapore’s population ages, we are faced with tighter labour constraints and a rising demand for healthcare services. Healthcare providers have to focus on productivity and improve operational efficiency to continue delivering quality care to patients.Productivity in healthcare is about increasing value to patients, for example by doing more with the same amount of resources. One initiative under our Productivity Drive is to use automation and robotics as a workforce multiplier to reduce the amount of manual work, and enable older employees to continue working for a longer period of time.Since 2012, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has supported healthcare providers to invest in productivity improvements. We have funded more than 200 projects so far, including those involving automation and robotics. Examples include the use of pneumatic tube systems for sending documents and specimens, and the automation of laboratory analysis processes. Hospitals are also using Automated Guided Vehicles to transport inventory items and deliver meals, and deploying automated cleaning robots, remote patient monitoring devices to improve their productivity.Another example is the Pharmacy Automation System, which allows medications to be picked more accurately and quickly. This has reduced pharmacy waiting times by up to 50% in KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital, National University Hospital and Tan Tock Seng Hospital. The Outpatient Pharmacy Automation System (OPAS) at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital’s Emergency Pharmacy was further developed to incorporate a new robotic bottle medication dispensing system that automatically loads, picks, and packs bottles. One year into implementation, OPAS has helped KKH to increase its pharmacy capacity by close to 30% with the same staff strength.We are also exploring new ways to deliver healthcare such as through tele-health, where consultations can be performed via video to reduce physical clinic visits. Physiotherapists could prescribe rehabilitation exercises to patients at home and monitor their progress remotely using wearable sensors and analytics. To bring healthcare beyond hospitals into the community, we are scaling up our national tele-health platforms to more healthcare institutions and community care providers.In addition, public healthcare institutions are reviewing their workflow and processes. This includes re-designing of job roles and up-skilling of healthcare staff to provide better care for patients. MOH will continue to work closely with our healthcare institutions to support productivity initiatives that enhance patient care and service quality, and make our healthcare system more productive and sustainable."
repair of lifts that break down repeatedly,"Ms Tin Pei Ling asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the Ministry's plan to fix new lifts that continue to break down despite a re-commissioning exercise; and (b) whether the expected increase in maintenance and repair cost over a ""lemon"" lift's shelf life due to the frequent breakdowns is less than the replacement cost.","Mr Lawrence Wong: MND takes a serious view on the safety of lifts in Singapore. We have previously explained HDB’s comprehensive approach - spanning lift procurement, installation and maintenance - to ensure that lifts in HDB estates are safe and fit for operation. There is a lift commissioning process in place, which includes an independent audit of key safety features and a stress test of 1,000 start-stop operations. These are over and above existing regulatory requirements.The lifts in Ms Tin Pei Ling’s ward which have been experiencing higher than usual breakdown and fault rates are part of a batch of 469 lifts recently installed by Sigma. HDB’s investigations revealed that while the design and installation of the affected lifts complied with prevailing codes and standards, the doors and sensors are more susceptible to misalignment.HDB has been working closely with Sigma to address this issue. Apart from the re-commissioning exercises which Ms Tin mentioned, Sigma has also been undertaking improvement works to make the doors less susceptible to misalignment. The works include modification, replacement and addition of some auxiliary components of the lift door to enhance door operations. As a result, we have seen an improvement in the performance of the Sigma lifts. To ensure that all issues are addressed, and the improvements in lift performance are sustained, a separate team of quality inspectors has been brought in by Sigma to conduct 100% checks on every one of the 469 lifts.HDB is closely monitoring the work done by the company, and will continue to hold Sigma responsible for the corrective action necessary to ensure that the lifts meet the required performance standards on a sustained basis."
impact of government's anti-smoking campaign on youth smoking,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Health (a) what has been the impact of the Government's anti-smoking campaign over the past three years; (b) how many smokers have given up smoking during this period; (c) how has the campaign prevented young people from taking up the habit; and (d) whether the Ministry has plans to increase the minimum age for buying cigarettes.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: As a result of our long-term tobacco control programme, smoking rates among those aged 18 to 69 years have decreased from 18.3% in 1992 to 13.3% in 2013, based on National Health Survey data. However, over the past three years, smoking rates seemed to have stayed at about 13%. Of concern is also the relatively high smoking rate among our men where nearly one in four smoke (23.1%). We need to do more.To discourage smoking, we have adopted a multi-pronged approach on tobacco control and public education. HPB has expanded its outreach to help smokers to quit. The number of smokers who took part in HPB’s smoking cessation programmes has more than doubled from about 6,000 in 2013 to about 15,000 in 2016.For youths, we focus on preventing initiation and helping young smokers to stop smoking. HPB works with educators and community organisations to promote smoke-free living among our youth. For example, smoking cessation training workshops are conducted for educators and youth workers to equip them with the skills and strategies to help youth smokers quit the habit. In addition, anti-tobacco messages are incorporated into the curriculum and Student Health Advisors (SHAs) are stationed in some schools to provide counselling to youth smokers.We need to sustain our efforts to discourage smoking. We are constantly studying various tobacco control initiatives and learning from the experiences of other countries, and will consider adopting suitable measures here, including the possibility of increasing the minimum age for buying cigarettes."
detection of illegal wildlife trade at border checkpoints,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for National Development (a) for each year in the past three years, how many cases of illegal wildlife trade have been detected at our border checkpoints and within Singapore (past the border checkpoints) respectively; (b) from these cases, how many live animals have been confiscated annually at our border checkpoints and within Singapore (past the border checkpoints) respectively; and (c) how many of these animals currently remain under our care.","Mr Lawrence Wong: In the last three years, AVA detected 10 cases of illegal wildlife trade at our border checkpoints. During the same period, 58 cases were detected within Singapore. Arising from these cases, AVA confiscated 660 live animals. While the vast majority were given to the Singapore Zoo or repatriated to the source country, 77 animals are still in AVA’s custody pending further investigations and court trials.AVA works closely with Singapore Customs and ICA on the detection of illegal wildlife trade cases. Information is also shared among our enforcement agencies to facilitate enforcement. While the authorities at all our border checkpoints remain vigilant, we also urge the public to do their part to refrain from such trade and to report any suspicious cases. By working together, we can help stop the illegal trade in wildlife."
prize for top literature gce 'a' level student,"Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry asked the Minister for Education (Schools) in view of Cambridge International Examinations' discontinuation of the Angus Ross Prize for English literature, whether the Ministry can set up (i) an equivalent A-level literature prize for Singapore and (ii) corresponding A-level literature prizes for mother tongue languages of Malay, Chinese and Tamil.","Mr Ng Chee Meng: The achievements of Singaporean students in the Angus Ross Prize was an additional testimony to the performance of our Literature students. The discontinuation of the Prize is unlikely to have a significant impact on our students’ interest in studying Literature at `A’ Level. This motivation is more associated with our students’ passion for the subject and efforts by our Literature teachers to make the subject come alive for students.MOE does not award a top academic award for any individual subject, and it is not necessary to start doing so now. While quality performance in examinations remains important, it is more important for us to emphasise the quality of our students’ learning experience throughout the entire `A’ Level course."
indiscriminate pasting of advertisements at public places,"Mr Darryl David asked the Minister for National Development whether the Government can prohibit the indiscriminate pasting of bills, flyers, advertisements and other similar materials at public places in HDB estates such as lifts, lift landings, doors, gates, circuit-boxes and other areas, in line with that taken by agencies such as the LTA in respect of the sticking of materials on lamp posts, traffic-light posts, railings and other public areas under its jurisdiction.","Mr Lawrence Wong: The Town Councils Act empowers Town Councils to set by-laws to regulate the use of common property, and impose fines for any contravention. Hence, Town Councils can take action under their by-laws against any person found pasting flyers and advertisements without the Town Councils’ authorisation.If stickers are pasted on residents’ doors or gates, the affected residents may seek help from their respective Town Councils. In practice, Town Councils would typically warn the advertisers against such actions. Town Councils may also remove the stickers or ask the advertisers to do so."
income generated by grassroots organisations from community trade fairs,"Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth for FY2015/16 what is (i) the amount of income earned by grassroots organisations (GROs) from community trade fairs (ii) the percentage of the earned income used by GROs for welfare assistance, scholarships and bursaries and (iii) the amount of sponsorships in kinds and cash collected by the GROs for staging community events.","Mr Chan Chun Sing (for the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth): Grassroots organisations (GROs) help PA achieve its mission of building cohesive communities. Amongst its many community building activities, GROs help organise various community service programmes, such as those that help seniors remain active in the community, and support needy families.To help fund some of these activities, GROs raised about $27 million in sponsorships and donations and $7 million from community trade fairs in FY2015/2016.In FY2015/2016, GROs also gave out $10 million in direct financial help such as welfare assistance, scholarships and bursaries. This complements Government assistance programmes for residents who need a bit more help."
commendation of women for sacrifices made in supporting national service,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Defence whether there are any plans in the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of National Service to honour women for the sacrifices they have made as mothers and wives of Singaporean men who have served national service.,"Dr Ng Eng Hen: As we commemorate 50 years of National Service this year, we are giving the NS50 Recognition Package to the more than one million national servicemen who have served two or more years of National Service duties, as a token of appreciation for their primary role in ensuring Singapore’s defence and security. National servicemen can enjoy the vouchers and free SAFRA and Home Team NS membership in the Package with their families.The wider community - families, employers, volunteers, religious groups, businesses and other community organisations - also plays an important role. Their support enables our national servicemen to serve with pride and dedication. We recognise these contributions through ongoing initiatives such as the Total Defence Awards and annual tax reliefs for spouses and parents of national servicemen. This year, we will continue to do so through the various NS50 events and activities, such as the NS50 Week and NS50 Dinner Reception."
impact of private car hire growth on taxi drivers' incomes,Mr Zaqy Mohamad asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the Ministry has studied the impact of the growth of the private car hire app industry on taxi drivers' incomes; (b) whether there is a difference in income between day hirers and midnight shift hirers; (c) whether taxi drivers' incomes have improved since the recent changes to the Taxi Availability Framework; (d) what more can be done to level the playing field and enhance the income of affected drivers; and (e) whether there are plans to engage taxi companies to adapt fare surcharges and rentals to help them cope with competition.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: In 2016, average monthly net earnings per taxi driver came down compared to the previous year, by about 6.2%. Notwithstanding this, in total since 2013, when the private hire car industry started to grow, average monthly net earnings per taxi driver are still up by about 4% in real terms, aided in part by falling energy prices. In addition, gross fare revenue per taxi has remained relatively stable since 2013. This suggests that private hire car services have, in part, catered to new or previously unmet demand.We do not have income data that is broken down by different types of drivers, for example, night shift drivers.It is too soon to determine the effect of the removal of the 250km requirement on taxi drivers. I expect it to be positive, not solely for their earnings but also the additional flexibility for them to plan their schedules. As the market continues to evolve, we will continue to review taxi regulations periodically to ensure that they stay relevant and promote the best outcomes for taxi commuters, drivers and companies.Ultimately, private hire car services compete against taxi companies for drivers, and the ability to attract drivers to rent either taxis or private hire cars is dependent on the earnings of the respective drivers. This competition can be positive for taxi drivers. I note that taxi companies have recently introduced measures to the benefit of their drivers. Some companies have reduced taxi rentals, while others have introduced innovative rental schemes, including giving rental rebates based on the drivers’ performance. Taxi companies can also adjust their fares and surcharges if they assess that this would make their services more competitive and taking into consideration the impact on their drivers’ earnings. Indeed, I hope the taxi industry will rise to the competition through such changes and by enhancing the level and value of service provided."
investment concerns given recent political developments in us and uncertainties in europe,Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for Finance whether recent political developments in the US and political uncertainties in Europe with upcoming elections raise concerns on the long-term investment outlook and whether it will affect the returns of our reserves.,"Mr Heng Swee Keat: Recent political developments have indeed increased uncertainty around the world. We are seeing structural issues that could signal a more challenging investment outlook. In many developed countries, productivity growth has remained subdued since the Global Financial Crisis, while demographics pose long-term challenges. In emerging countries, reforms have been intermittent, and the overall pace has been uneven across different countries.In the short to medium term, political developments across the world, including recent actions taken by the new US Administration and various elections coming up in Europe, have indeed raised uncertainty for investors.That said, this is not the first time that our investment entities have had to face an uncertain future, and it will not be the last time. GIC and Temasek, like other global investors, cannot be insulated from volatility in the financial markets.However, GIC and Temasek are long-term investors. Their long-term orientation enables them to look beyond short term market volatility, and target good long-term sustainable returns on a total portfolio basis. Both investment entities also adhere to the discipline of reviewing their investments regularly, and adjusting their strategies where necessary.Another important aspect is the governance framework. GIC and Temasek have strong professional teams to assess potential investments and take investment decisions. The Government does not intervene in specific investment decisions, but instead, ensures that well qualified individuals are appointed to their Boards to exercise oversight. This allows the management to focus on optimising long term returns, while being accountable to the Government through their Boards for their overall performance. This governance framework has served us well through past periods of crisis and uncertainty."
rejection rates for sme working capital loan programme,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) since the launch of the SME Working Capital Loan Programme in June 2016 (a) how many SMEs' applications under the programme have been rejected; (b) what are the reasons for these rejected applications; and (c) what other Government financing assistance can such SMEs seek.,"Mr S Iswaran: The SME Working Capital Loan was announced at Budget 2016 to help viable SMEs access working capital and continue growing their businesses. The scheme complements existing Government loan schemes and commercial loans offered by financial institutions. SPRING works through Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs), which evaluate the applications for the SME Working Capital Loan.Since the launch of the SME Working Capital Loan in June 2016, more than $700 million in loans has been catalysed, benefitting about 4,300 SMEs as of end December 2016. This represents a success rate of about 80% to 85%. Common reasons for unsuccessful applications are that the SMEs have poor financial track records, such as lack of profitability, or that owners have adverse individual credit bureau records1, such as late payments on personal loans.Besides the SME Working Capital Loan, the Government partners PFIs to make loans available to viable SMEs with different needs. The loans offered include factory and equipment loans and trade financing, and complement the commercial loans offered by these PFIs. Besides traditional bank financing, SMEs can also tap alternative financing platforms like venture lending.Beyond the immediate financing needs, SMEs should continue to develop capabilities to transform their businesses to remain competitive and achieve continued growth. SMEs who require assistance in their growth can tap on a suite of Government schemes which can support them in building capabilities, scaling up and internationalisation."
government tenders for public opinion polls,Mr Low Thia Khiang asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) how many public opinion polls have been put up for tender on GeBIZ between 2014 and 2016; (b) how many of such tenders have not been put up on GeBIZ; (c) what has been the total amount spent on public opinion polls during this period; (d) what is the total number of respondents covered in these polls; and (e) what criteria does REACH use to determine if the findings of a poll are of interest to the public and hence worthy of publication.,"Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim: MCI conducts opinion polls to understand public sentiment on issues, and to assess public awareness of, and response to, specific Government policies and programmes. Opinion polls have helped the Government evaluate if there are segments of the population who might benefit from a better understanding of a policy or programme. This is in line with our overall thrust of using data to better inform our communications strategy. The data also helps the Government adjust the way it delivers services or implements policies, to better meet the needs of citizens.All tenders for public opinion polls are put up on GeBiz. MCI has put in place a Whole-of Government Framework Agreement for Research and Perception Studies on Gebiz, which enables government agencies to commission research projects by tapping on a pool of vendors.Between 2014 and 2016, MCI commissioned a total of 14 opinion polls through the Framework Agreement. On average, opinion polls reach between 1,000 to 2,000 respondents, to ensure that the sample is broadly representative of the national population. The amount spent by the Government on opinion polls is in line with market rates.REACH periodically releases findings that may be of interest to the public – these touch on topical issues which may have been discussed in the media or other platforms. Such representative polling can help to provide a more holistic and objective sensing of public sentiments on issues."
facilitating claims for injuries from use of personal mobility devices,"Mr Zaqy Mohamad asked the Minister for Transport with the greater anticipated use of PMDs and bicycles on footpaths (a) how can the Ministry help facilitate injury or damage claims between two parties, to prevent small claims from being settled by costly civil suits; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider setting up a claims tribunal to facilitate injury claims in the absence of compulsory insurance.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Accidents involving serious injury or damages will be investigated by the Police. If a cyclist or PMD user is found to be at fault, they may be prosecuted and the courts may make an order for compensation.We will closely monitor the use of PMDs and bicycles on footpaths. It is premature to set up a claims tribunal as the Member has suggested. Meanwhile, we will intensify user education and enforce proper sharing of footpaths."
impact of checkpoint toll charges on inflation and food prices,Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the latest reciprocal road charge on foreign-registered vehicles entering Singapore will impact domestic inflation and food prices; and (b) whether the road charge can be waived for commercial goods vehicles.,Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The Reciprocal Road Charge will not be imposed on commercial goods vehicles.
more parking options for heavy vehicle owners,Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for National Development whether Government has plans to build more heavy vehicle parks and to improve its public transport connectivity so that these vehicle parks can be more accessible to the drivers.,"78 Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for National Development whether HDB can consider raising the allowable unladen weight for vans and light goods vehicles at HDB multi-storey car parks beyond the current 1,800 kg to 2,100 kg so that such vehicle owners/drivers can find more convenient parking and ease the season parking demand pressure on those popular heavy vehicle parks.Mr Lawrence Wong: Currently, there are about 43,190 heavy vehicle parking spaces island wide, which exceeds the 33,680 heavy vehicles registered with LTA. About 74% of the heavy vehicle parking spaces are privately operated and located in industrial estates.The remaining 26% of heavy vehicle parking spaces is managed by URA and HDB in the form of temporary heavy vehicle parks located within or at the fringes of residential areas. Over time, these temporary heavy vehicle parks will be progressively phased out, partly to make way for new developments, and partly because having heavy vehicles enter densely populated heartland precincts poses a safety risk, especially to the elderly and young children. To facilitate this transition, agencies are incorporating new heavy vehicle parks within industrial developments that are near to residential areas, where feasible.Ultimately, it is the responsibility of business owners to provide or secure parking for the vehicles that they own, and to provide their drivers with the appropriate transport options to get to their vehicles for work. This is especially so if they require their drivers work during odd hours.Commercial vehicles, such as vans and light goods vehicles, with unladen weight exceeding 1,800 kg, are generally not allowed to park in HDB residential car parks for safety and environmental reasons.However, HDB does exercise flexibility by allowing them to use the residential car parks if the vehicles can fit within a standard car lot, and do not obstruct or endanger other car park users. Such vehicles should, however, not exceed an unladen weight of 2,000 kg if they intend to park within HDB multi-storey car parks (MSCP) as the MSCPs are not designed to withstand vehicular weights beyond this limit. Those that exceed an unladen weight of 2,000 kg can park in HDB surface residential car parks. They can also park at commercial and industrial car parks, as well as heavy vehicle parks."
decision on driverless taxis in singapore,Ms Sun Xueling asked the Minister for Transport how is the trial operation of nuTonomy driverless taxis progressing and what benchmarks will the Ministry use to determine when driverless taxis can be rolled out in more parts of Singapore and its associated timeline.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: nuTonomy is one of four organisations, besides A*STAR's Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology and Delphi Automotive Systems, that is testing self-driving vehicles at one-north. nuTonomy started trialling on a 6-kilometre test route in April 2016, and since January this year, they have expanded their testing to a 12-kilometre route. I am told that their trials have generally been smooth except for an incident last year. nuTonomy's aim is to gradually expand their trials into larger and more complex environments.Significant challenges have to be overcome before self-driving technology is ready for widespread deployment. Self-driving vehicles need to be able to co-exist safely with a high volume of human-driven vehicles, cyclists, people on personal mobility devices, and pedestrians. They will need to be able to deal with unexpected situations like fallen tree branches or jaywalkers. In Singapore, they also need to function effectively under low visibility conditions, such as during heavy rain or haze. Industry experts expect the technology to reach that state in about 10 to 15 years. In the meantime, LTA will continue to work with the participants to expand the area and complexity of their trials progressively."
availability of hdb rental flats and rental flats converted for sale,"Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for National Development as of 31 December 2016, what is the number of (i) available vacant HDB rental flats (ii) rental flats converted for sale with a shorter lease and (iii) such converted flats sold.","Mr Lawrence Wong: As at end 2016, there were about 4,500 vacant rental flats.To promote homeownership, when existing rental flats are vacated, they can be considered for conversion to sold flats if viable. Over the years, about 9,300 ex-rental flats were converted, most of them before 2011. These flats are sold with the balance of the 99-year leases. Of these, about 9,000 flats have been sold."
cost of re-organising healthcare clusters into three groups,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Health (a) how much will the re-organisation of the healthcare clusters cost; (b) what are the considerations for re-organisation into the three clusters instead of two or more than three; (c) what additional concrete benefits of the re-organisation such as shorter waiting times for appointments, are there for patients.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: We announced in 2012 Healthcare 2020, which outlined our plan to expand capacity, improve quality and enhance the affordability of healthcare services. Even as we implement Healthcare 2020, we need to plan ahead further into the future. Last year, I announced three key shifts to prepare for our healthcare needs beyond 2020: beyond hospital to community, beyond quality to value and beyond healthcare to health. This transformation is necessary as our healthcare needs will grow in volume and complexity due to our ageing population and increased chronic disease burden, among others. For this reason, we need to organise ourselves better so that we can implement the transformation more swiftly and decisively.The public healthcare system will be reorganised into three integrated clusters, each having a fuller range of facilities, capabilities, services and networks across different care settings. This will enable them to deliver more comprehensive and person-centred health promotion, disease prevention, curative and rehabilitative care for the population in their respective regions.Primary care will play an increasingly important role in our care transformation. After reorganisation, each cluster will have a group of polyclinics which, together with General Practitioner partners and community partners, can anchor care more firmly in primary and community settings. Collectively, these changes will ultimately benefit Singaporeans by providing more appropriate care and bringing care closer to them.In addition to greater economies of scale, the reorganisation will also facilitate scaling up of programmes and services by the integrated clusters, and their collaborations with the private sector and community partners, across a wider region to benefit more Singaporeans.The integrated clusters will be able to tap on a larger pool of manpower resources and talents. They will also be able to offer their employees a wider and deeper range of professional development opportunities, and a broader platform for cross-learning that will benefit staff and our patients.We do not expect to incur significant financial cost for the reorganisation. The planned infrastructure and service developments are already included in our Healthcare 2020 Master Plan and the three key shifts I highlighted and they are separately catered for in our healthcare budget. These will need to be implemented regardless of the reorganisation."
incidence of postal letters delivered to wrong address,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) how often are postal letters delivered to the wrong address; (b) what action is being taken to improve the service; (c) what are the common reasons for the wrong delivery; and (d) whether any fine-tuning on the sorting process of letters and training of postmen are required.,"Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim: Postal delivery in Singapore is regulated by the Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA). Under IMDA's Postal Quality of Service (QoS) framework, SingPost needs to deliver 99% of local basic letters destined for the Central Business District (CBD) by the next working day, and 98% of local basic letters destined for non-CBD areas. SingPost is also required to achieve 100% delivery by the second working day. These are one of the most stringent standards for local basic mail in the world.SingPost delivers more than three million items a day. In 2016, SingPost received about 50 incidents of feedback concerning mis-delivered local basic letters.This is a significant improvement from 279 incidents of feedback concerning mis-delivered local basic letters in 2013 and 155 in 2015. Letters are mis-delivered for several reasons – the postman could have delivered the letter to the wrong letter box; or the address could have been incomplete or incorrectly written.While the number of mis-deliveries is very small, IMDA takes a serious view of all cases as they inconvenience businesses and individuals. IMDA works closely with SingPost to reduce mis-delivery rates, and improve their quality of service. In that regard, SingPost has taken active steps in the last few years to improve its service qualitya. In 2014, SingPost invested $45 million on sorting machines to improve mail sorting efficiency and accuracy.b. SingPost has enhanced its staff training programme, which includes the postmen code of conduct, on-the-job training and customer service training. Since 2014, SingPost has hired quality control officers to further ensure that letters are correctly delivered.c. Finally, as part of its ongoing efforts to engage senders of letters, SingPost provides a 24/7 customer care hotline and has service ambassadors stationed at post offices. SingPost also regularly updates its website with mailing guidelines and tips on addressing letters.The drop in number of complaints over the last three years show that these efforts have been helpful. Nevertheless, IMDA will continue to monitor SingPost's performance, and review the Postal QoS framework, to ensure that SingPost continues to provide reliable and quality postal services for Singapore."
ensuring safety of sigma lifts installed for hdb flats,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for National Development (a) what steps is the Ministry taking or has taken to ensure that the Sigma lifts currently in operation are safe to use; and (b) whether it will be taking any action against Sigma and its parent company.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: MND takes a serious view on the safety of lifts in Singapore. HDB has in place a comprehensive set of measures spanning lift procurement, installation and maintenance to ensure that lifts in HDB blocks are safe and fit for operation. In particular, lifts are procured through open tenders, and the evaluation process factors in quality and reliability of lift contractors. Audits, stress-tests and inspections in the presence of an independent Authorised Examiner (AE) are also conducted as part of a well-established lift commissioning process.Sigma has been installing lifts in HDB estates for the past 10 years, and has generally met the prescribed performance standards. However, for a recent batch contract awarded to Sigma in 2013, Sigma was unable to meet the timeline for lift installation. Hence in late 2015, HDB restricted Sigma from tendering for new HDB lift contracts, to ensure that Sigma dedicated its resources to fulfil its contractual obligations. HDB also observed a higher-than-usual breakdown and fault rate in lifts from this batch contract in their first year of operations. The tender restriction has therefore not been lifted, and will continue until performance standards improve.HDB's investigations revealed that while the design and installation of the affected lifts complied with prevailing codes and standards, the doors and sensors were more susceptible to misalignment from knocks. This, coupled with frequent heavy and rough lift usage during the first year period due to renovation and moving activities, resulted in the higher lift faults.HDB has instructed Sigma to rectify these issues and to carry out improvement works to ensure that the lift doors and sensors operate smoothly. HDB has also issued stern warnings to Sigma, and is closely monitoring the performance of its lifts.Both Sigma and its parent company have channelled more resources towards addressing the issues. In particular, Sigma has undertaken the rectification works progressively, and the performance of the lifts has improved. HDB will continue to hold Sigma accountable for ensuring its lifts meet the required performance standards."
study on legislating eldercare leave,"Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the outcome of the Ministry's study on legislating eldercare leave for employees; (b) what are the barriers that impede legislation of eldercare leave; and (c) from 2012-2017, how many working caregivers do not have eldercare leave and how many working caregivers quit work to care for an elderly family member full-time.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: We recognise that caregiving is an important responsibility and is no easy feat, particularly for those who have to juggle between work and caregiving roles. The Ministry of Health has strengthened efforts to support caregivers by expanding the capacity of aged care services and the number of home and community care options.We have been studying the issue of legislating eldercare leave in consultation with unions and employers. On balance, we are not ready to legislate eldercare leave at this time, as we need to strike a balance between employers' concerns on business costs and manpower constraints, and the employability of caregivers, versus the need for additional leave provision for eldercare purposes. There are existing leave provisions that can be used for this purpose.According to MOM's Comprehensive Labour Force Survey, some 176,200 females aged 25 to 54 were outside of the labour force in 2016, of which 10% were due to caregiving for family members or relatives. In relation to that, we encourage companies to provide more family-related leave benefits which can be used for different purposes, as well as flexible work arrangements. We track this provision and the trends have been encouraging thus far.Sixty-seven percent of employees work in companies that offer at least one formal flexible work arrangement last year, up from 56% in 2011. Close to eight in 10 employers also provide unplanned time-off or ad-hoc teleworking for their employees to attend to personal matters.Public service agencies currently already provide two days of parent care leave per year. Some private companies have also done so. OCBC offers two days of family care to employees who are not entitled to childcare leave. Cerebos Pacific Limited, a manufacturing company, also offers family care leave on top of statutory leave.We will continue to review the need for legislating eldercare leave as our socio-economic circumstances evolve over time."
public education on responsible pet ownership,Mr Darryl David asked the Minister for National Development whether the Government will take stronger action against recalcitrant residents who flout HDB rules on pets as the incessant noise and unpleasant animal smells affect the surrounding environment and residents.,"25 Mr Seah Kian Peng asked the Minister for National Development in light of the high proportion of pet-related complaints that HDB receives, whether more can be done to educate pet owners about responsibility and due care of their pets.Mr Lawrence Wong: In high-rise, high-density Singapore, and especially in our housing estates, it is important for Singaporeans to be both responsible pet owners and considerate neighbours. Pet owners are wholly responsible for ensuring that their pets are well cared for, and that they do not adversely affect the wider living environment.AVA has focused its efforts on raising public awareness about responsible pet ownership. For the younger generation, AVA holds two to three school talks and learning journeys every month. AVA is also developing a pre-school kit for kindergarten teachers to educate their students on animal care and welfare. For the broader community, AVA conducts responsible pet ownership roadshows every year. These roadshows include interactive displays, children’s activities, competitions, talks and workshops. The most recent roadshow at Waterway Point in December 2016 attracted 12,000 attendees.In the event that pets are causing a nuisance, HDB officers would advise the flat owners to take measures to stop the nuisance. Where necessary, parties concerned are also advised to attend mediation to resolve the issue amicably. In most cases, this improves the situation. For recalcitrant owners whose pets persistently cause disamenity, they may be required to re-home their pets with assistance from animal welfare groups. As a last resort, recalcitrant owners may be brought to court, where upon conviction, they can be fined up to $4,000."
offset from government rebates for utility bills,"Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling asked the Minister for Finance (a) to what extent has the GST Voucher – Utilities-Save rebate helped to offset utilitie bills during periods of increases in electricity tariffs especially for rental flats; and (b) for those households under the Pay-As-You-Use scheme, whether this rebate can be directly credited into their prepaid utilities account.","Mr Heng Swee Keat: The permanent GST Voucher – U-Save scheme has enabled households in 1- and 2-room HDB flats to receive support which is equivalent to about three to four months of their utilities bills on average. Those living in 3- and 4-room HDB flats receive support equivalent to about one to two months of their utilities bills. The Pay-As-You-Use (PAYU) scheme is a pre-paid metering scheme launched by SP Services in May 2005 to support a small minority of HDB households whose electricity supply has been disconnected due to arrears in utilities payment. PAYU helps these households have their supply reconnected, while allowing them to settle their arrears over time1. For a household on the PAYU scheme, the applicable U-Save rebate is already being credited to their utilities account to help reduce their arrears. If the arrears have been cleared and that household chooses to remain on the PAYU scheme, the U-Save then offsets the water and gas components of the bill."
population trend for stray cats,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling asked the Minister for National Development (a) how does AVA monitor the population of stray cats in housing estates; (b) what is the population trend of stray cats over past three years; (c) what measures are put in place to manage its population; and (d) what actions are taken against irresponsible cat feeders.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: AVA does not track the population of stray cats. But AVA works with the Cat Welfare Society (CWS) and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) on stray cat sterilisation. Efforts are also made to try to rehome stray cats, although this is not feasible in all cases.Under the Stray Cat Sterilisation Programme (SCSP), AVA subsidises the cost of sterilising and micro-chipping stray cats in HDB estates, industrial and commercial areas, as well as in private housing estates. Through these efforts, the annual number of feedback cases on stray cats has dropped from more than 4,000 in 2014 to fewer than 3,000 in 2016.AVA also works with CWS and the SPCA to educate community feeders to feed stray cats responsibly. This includes placing food in receptacles and clearing up after the feeding. If these conditions are not adhered to, irresponsible feeders can be fined up to $2,000, $4,000 and $10,000 for their first, second and subsequent convictions for littering."
proposal for child sex offenders registry,"Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) in the past five years, how many cases of child sex offences have been reported; (b) what is being done to reduce such crimes; and (c) whether there are plans to create a sex offender registry with limited access given to agencies and communities that can benefit from the information.","Mr K Shanmugam: From 2012 to 2016, the Police investigated an annual average of 325 cases of serious sexual crimes involving victims below the age of 16. Sexual penetration of minor made up the majority of serious sexual crimes, accounting for about 230 cases a year on average. This is followed by about 75 cases of rape a year and 20 cases of sexual assault by penetration a year.Over the same period, the Police also investigated about 290 cases of outrage of modesty and 45 cases of sexual exploitation and sexual grooming per year. The trend for sexual crimes involving victims below 16 years of age has been stable over the past five years.We take a serious view of sexual crimes, in particular when the victims are minors. To tackle these offences, we adopt a four-pronged approach.Firstly, the Penal Code imposes stiff penalties for serious sexual offences. For instance, rape is punishable with an imprisonment term of up to 20 years and also liable to caning. If the rape involved a minor under the age of 14 without consent, the enhanced punishment is an imprisonment term of not less than eight years and up to 20 years with minimum 12 strokes of caning. We have also created specific offences targeting those who take advantage of the vulnerable, such as sexual grooming of minors.Secondly, we enforce these laws firmly. Police take all allegations of sexual offences seriously. Sexual crimes are investigated by specialist units in the Police Divisions and the Criminal Investigation Department. The investigation officers in these units are trained to handle sexual crime investigations, as well as to manage sexual crime victims, including minors, with appropriate sensitivity.Thirdly, we take a robust approach towards rehabilitation and reintegration of sex offenders, so as to reduce reoffending. For less serious offences, the court may make mandatory treatment orders requiring the sex offender to undergo psychiatric treatment. Sex offenders who are imprisoned for more serious offences are put through the sex offender treatment programme administered by the Singapore Prison Service, which seeks to reduce reoffending by enhancing self-management of sex offending behaviour.Fourthly, the Police also work with relevant agencies to put in place proactive safeguards. These include conducting talks in MOE schools to educate students on precautions to protect themselves from sexual assault, and to raise awareness of the legal and social consequences of teenage sex. The Police also train teachers and school counsellors to recognise and report tell-tale signs of sexual assault or abuse in students.The Member asked about plans to create a sex offender registry with limited access given to agencies. The Registration of Criminal Act allows the Police to maintain a non-public record of persons convicted of serious offences, including sexual offences. Agencies such as MOE and MSF work closely with the Police to screen prospective employees who are applying for jobs involving children. For example, MOE screens prospective employees for child care centres, kindergartens and schools with the Police. These processes ensure that persons who have committed serious sexual crimes are not employed in sensitive positions which may put children at risk, but without publicly listing sex offenders which will add to the stigmatisation of these offenders and hinder rehabilitation and reintegration efforts."
conversion of government-paid adoption leave to shared parental leave,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Prime Minister whether the Government-Paid Adoption Leave (GPAL) can (i) be converted into shared leave which parents can allocate between themselves as they choose, instead of being open to mothers only and (ii) be extended to parents (both mothers and fathers) who adopt children above the age of 12 months old.","Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): With the latest enhancements announced on 13 April 2016 which will take effect on 1 July 2017, adoptive fathers will enjoy the same leave provisions as biological fathers. What Mr Ng has proposed goes beyond what is provided for biological fathers.The Government is strongly committed to supporting Singaporeans in their aspirations to get married and raise families. Leave has been one of the key measures to help working parents, including adoptive parents, better manage their work and family commitments.Leave provisions have been progressively enhanced over the years, and several new enhancements will take effect this year, including allowing a portion of Government-Paid Adoption Leave to be converted to shared leave. Specifically, the enhancements are(a) The second week of paternity leave has been made mandatory from 1 January 2017, which both biological and adoptive fathers are eligible for;(b) Government-Paid Adoption Leave will be extended from four to 12 weeks from 1 July 2017; and(c) Both adoptive and biological fathers will be able to share up to four weeks from their spouse’s Adoption or Maternity Leave respectively.With these enhancements, adoptive fathers will enjoy the same leave provisions as biological fathers, and working parents (biological and adoptive) will have more flexibility to decide on the allocation of leave that best suits their caregiving needs.Adoption Leave – like Maternity and Paternity Leave – is intended to support parents of infants in their first year after delivery, when infants are more vulnerable and need more care. Hence, usage of the leave is limited to the child’s first year of age. Beyond the child’s infancy, all working parents, including adoptive parents, can take six days of paid childcare leave each per year until the child turns seven years old, and two days each per year when their children are between the ages of seven and 12 years. In addition, parents are eligible for six days of unpaid infantcare leave per parent each year, during the child’s first two years.Employers have provided feedback that even if the overall duration of leave provisions remains unchanged, extending their coverage (for example, beyond the first year of the child’s life), or allowing even more flexibility in sharing the leave between parents, could have an impact on manpower and administrative costs, especially in a time of business uncertainties. We need to balance between providing support for employees with caregiving needs, and employers' concerns on business costs and manpower constraints, as well as the employability of caregivers. Given the significant enhancements made recently, we will not be adjusting the Adoption Leave provisions further, at this point of time.It will be more important and sustainable for employers to provide a family-friendly work environment, such as by having flexible work arrangements in place, and for our wider community to create a more family-friendly environment in Singapore. Employers can tap on various resources to implement flexible work arrangements, including the WorkPro Work-Life Grant from the Ministry of Manpower and the Tripartite Advisory on Flexible Work Arrangements published by the tripartite partners."
periodic assessment for service personnel who handle weapons,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan asked the Minister for Defence whether service personnel in roles which involve access to weapons and live ammunition are periodically re-assessed on the stability of their emotional and psychological state.,"Dr Ng Eng Hen: MINDEF/SAF recognises the importance of ensuring that all servicemen and women who handle live arms are of sound mind and physical capabilities. The SAF has in place various levels of checks to determine the psychological well-being of service personnel. Before enlistment, all pre-enlistees undergo a comprehensive medical screening at the Central Manpower Base for both physical and mental health conditions. Pre-enlistees are asked explicitly if they have a previous record of mental health conditions during the screening. In addition, we require the parent or guardian to endorse this declaration. There is a balance between privacy for the enlistee and potential safety concerns of those with previous mental health conditions. But since 2016, MINDEF/SAF has also been working with the Ministry of Health to identify pre-enlistees with records of mental health history at public hospitals. If a possible mental health condition is surfaced, the pre-enlistee will be referred to appropriate specialists to certify that that enlistee is mentally capable of performing their National Service duties and to handle firearms.A serviceman who is deemed unsuitable to handle firearms because of his emotional or psychological state are excused from such duties and re-deployed to vocations which do not require him to have access to weapons and live ammunition.SAF servicemen have avenues to obtain counselling or medical assistance, should they face any emotional or psychological distress, including a 24-hour SAF Counselling Hotline. Those diagnosed with mental health conditions are closely monitored while in service, and where necessary, are provided with regular medical treatment and counselling by psychiatrists, psychologists, counsellors and para-counsellors. We deploy dedicated psychologists at the formation level to assist commanders in the management of such servicemen. At the unit level, our commanders interview all servicemen at regular intervals to find out if they are facing any stresses, including emotional or psychological problems. Commanders also undergo basic training to help them better understand mental health conditions, so that they can try to identify and manage servicemen with such conditions, including referring them to trained professionals for more assistance, or restricting their access to weapons and ammunition.MINDEF and the SAF will continue to periodically review and strengthen the mental health system, in consultation with the SAF Psychiatry Specialist Advisory Board, which comprises senior psychiatrists drawn from public healthcare institutions, to ensure that all our servicemen are able to discharge their duties and at the same time, to receive good emotional and mental health care."
activities to encourage secondary school students to take calculated risks,Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for Education (Schools) (a) whether there are plans to introduce more activities that will encourage secondary school students to think out-of-the-box; and (b) how can schools help to imbue in the students the spirit to take on calculated risks.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: To better prepare our students to thrive in the future, MOE has identified a set of 21st Century Competencies to develop in all students. Critical and Inventive Thinking is one of the competencies to be developed. By nurturing our students to be more inventive in their thinking, they will be more ready to think out of the box.Critical and Inventive Thinking is developed through both the academic curriculum and the co-curricular programmes. Our efforts in this area have been building up steadily over the years.During lessons, teachers stimulate curiosity and creativity in their students through the use of inquiry-based pedagogies, and novel and open-ended learning tasks. Such approaches encourage students to challenge assumptions, explore new possibilities and embrace uncertainties. Such dispositions are also nurtured through authentic learning experiences in Values-in-Action projects and Co-Curricular Activities, where students have to identify problems that need to be solved and come up with creative solutions.We have also been providing students with more opportunities for applied learning. This will enable them to apply skills and knowledge gained in the classroom to address real-world problems. Examples of such opportunities include the Applied Learning Programme and Learning for Life Programme in primary and secondary schools, as well as Advanced Elective Modules and Applied Subjects in secondary schools.To help students grow in their confidence to take calculated risks, our schools seek to provide a learning environment where students can feel safe to make choices, try new ideas and recover from setbacks. We need to help students find more intrinsic motivations in their learning so that they are driven more by a sense of passion. As our schools continue to strengthen their efforts in nurturing such traits in students, we recognise that such cultural shifts will take time and need to be reinforced at home."
care options for adults with intellectual disabilities whose parents or care-givers have passed away,Mr Darryl David asked the Minister for Social and Family Development what options are available for the long-term care of adults with intellectual disabilities when the parents/caregivers of these adults pass away or are unable to care for them any more.,"Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: Parents and caregivers of adults with disabilities are encouraged to plan ahead for the care needs of their loved ones. As a first line of support, parents and caregivers can seek the help of other family members who are willing to continue to provide care. Parents may want to explore with these family members on the possibility of them applying to the Courts to be appointed as a deputy who can make decisions for the adult with disability upon their mental incapacity or demise. This enables the person with disability to continue living in the community.Caregivers and parents can approach the Special Needs Trust Company or SNTC whose case managers will work together with the family to develop a care plan that provides for the well-being of the person with disability in various aspects such as accommodation, daily living and medical needs.One of the main concerns for parents and caregivers is providing sufficient financial support for their children with disabilities. SNTC assists parents to set up a Trust account to be managed and disbursed to meet the needs of their children with disability when required. SNTC also oversees the Special Needs Savings Scheme which allows parents to set aside Central Provident Fund savings for the long term care of their children upon their demise.For parents and caregivers who require assistance in the care of their adult children with intellectual disabilities, there are community-based programmes such as Day Activity Centres and home-based care services.The Adult Disability Home or ADH is a last resort for parents if there is no other family support for their adult children with intellectual disabilities. ADHs provide care for adults with disabilities who require long-term residential care. Today, there are six ADHs providing 690 places for adults with intellectual disability and there are plans to increase the number of places to 870 by the end of this year."
prohibit consumption of alcohol in areas close to residential blocks,"Mr Darryl David asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether the Government will prohibit alcohol consumption in all public areas in HDB estates that are close to residential blocks to prevent undesirable acts of indiscriminate urination, rowdy behaviour and acts of public affray that affect the residents of the affected blocks.","Mr K Shanmugam: Under the Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Act, consumption of alcohol in all public places, including public areas in HDB estates, is already prohibited between 10.30pm and 7.00am. The restricted hours were intended to minimise disruption to the usual activities of most residents. 10.30pm is the closing time of most businesses in residential areas, as well as the time when most community activities cease.Since the Liquor Control Act came into effect on 1 April 2015, we have observed a general island-wide decline in the number of public order incidents related to liquor consumption and feedback on social dis-amenities such as noise caused by people drinking in public late at night. There is therefore no necessity to extend the restricted hours for public consumption of alcohol at the present time.The Member's suggestion to extend the restricted hours for certain areas in HDB estates is also challenging to implement. This would result in finely delineated zones within the same HDB estate. Different common areas, depending on whether they were located near residential blocks, would have different restricted hours for alcohol consumption. Members of the public may be confused which zone they are in, making compliance and enforcement difficult."
availability of hdb rental flats and rental flats converted for sale,"Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for National Development as of 31 December 2016, what is the number of (i) available vacant HDB rental flats (ii) rental flats converted for sale with a shorter lease and (iii) such converted flats sold.","Mr Lawrence Wong: As at end 2016, there were about 4,500 vacant rental flats.To promote homeownership, when existing rental flats are vacated, they can be considered for conversion to sold flats if viable. Over the years, about 9,300 ex-rental flats were converted, most of them before 2011. These flats are sold with the balance of the 99-year leases. Of these, about 9,000 flats have been sold."
cost of re-organising healthcare clusters into three groups,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Health (a) how much will the re-organisation of the healthcare clusters cost; (b) what are the considerations for re-organisation into the three clusters instead of two or more than three; (c) what additional concrete benefits of the re-organisation such as shorter waiting times for appointments, are there for patients.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: We announced in 2012 Healthcare 2020, which outlined our plan to expand capacity, improve quality and enhance the affordability of healthcare services. Even as we implement Healthcare 2020, we need to plan ahead further into the future. Last year, I announced three key shifts to prepare for our healthcare needs beyond 2020: beyond hospital to community, beyond quality to value and beyond healthcare to health. This transformation is necessary as our healthcare needs will grow in volume and complexity due to our ageing population and increased chronic disease burden, among others. For this reason, we need to organise ourselves better so that we can implement the transformation more swiftly and decisively.The public healthcare system will be reorganised into three integrated clusters, each having a fuller range of facilities, capabilities, services and networks across different care settings. This will enable them to deliver more comprehensive and person-centred health promotion, disease prevention, curative and rehabilitative care for the population in their respective regions.Primary care will play an increasingly important role in our care transformation. After reorganisation, each cluster will have a group of polyclinics which, together with General Practitioner partners and community partners, can anchor care more firmly in primary and community settings. Collectively, these changes will ultimately benefit Singaporeans by providing more appropriate care and bringing care closer to them.In addition to greater economies of scale, the reorganisation will also facilitate scaling up of programmes and services by the integrated clusters, and their collaborations with the private sector and community partners, across a wider region to benefit more Singaporeans.The integrated clusters will be able to tap on a larger pool of manpower resources and talents. They will also be able to offer their employees a wider and deeper range of professional development opportunities, and a broader platform for cross-learning that will benefit staff and our patients.We do not expect to incur significant financial cost for the reorganisation. The planned infrastructure and service developments are already included in our Healthcare 2020 Master Plan and the three key shifts I highlighted and they are separately catered for in our healthcare budget. These will need to be implemented regardless of the reorganisation."
offset from government rebates for utility bills,"Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling asked the Minister for Finance (a) to what extent has the GST Voucher – Utilities-Save rebate helped to offset utilitie bills during periods of increases in electricity tariffs especially for rental flats; and (b) for those households under the Pay-As-You-Use scheme, whether this rebate can be directly credited into their prepaid utilities account.","Mr Heng Swee Keat: The permanent GST Voucher – U-Save scheme has enabled households in 1- and 2-room HDB flats to receive support which is equivalent to about three to four months of their utilities bills on average. Those living in 3- and 4-room HDB flats receive support equivalent to about one to two months of their utilities bills. The Pay-As-You-Use (PAYU) scheme is a pre-paid metering scheme launched by SP Services in May 2005 to support a small minority of HDB households whose electricity supply has been disconnected due to arrears in utilities payment. PAYU helps these households have their supply reconnected, while allowing them to settle their arrears over time1. For a household on the PAYU scheme, the applicable U-Save rebate is already being credited to their utilities account to help reduce their arrears. If the arrears have been cleared and that household chooses to remain on the PAYU scheme, the U-Save then offsets the water and gas components of the bill."
eldershield premiums paid out since 2002,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Health since the inception of ElderShield in 2002; (a) what has been the total ElderShield premiums paid; (b) what is the total surplus collected by the ElderShield insurers; (c) what is the total surplus returned to members as premium rebates; and (d) what is the payout ratio and profit margin of each of the ElderShield insurers.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: ElderShield is an insurance scheme that provides basic protection against the costs of long-term care arising from severe disability in old age. Premiums for policyholders are collected annually between age 40 and 65. Coverage starts at age 40 and the policyholder is covered for life. If a policyholder becomes severely disabled before age 65, he will no longer need to pay further premiums and will start to receive monthly ElderShield payouts. From 2002 to end-2015, about $2.6 billion have been collected in premiums and around $100 million have been paid out in claims. About $130 million in premium rebates have been given to policyholders so far, the first tranche in 2007 and another in 2012.The oldest ElderShield cohort that enrolled at age 40 in 2002 will be turning 55 this year. The current age profile of policyholders is relatively young but will get older over time. As older people are more likely to become severely disabled compared to younger people, ElderShield payouts are expected to increase when the profile of policyholders gets older. Indeed, the proportion of claims over premiums collected has been increasing since ElderShield started in 2002, and this trend will continue in the future.People who are not familiar with how ElderShield works may ask why the current amount of premiums collected is much higher than the amount of claims paid out so far. Some may even wrongly conclude that policyholders have been paying too much in premiums or that insurers have made excessive profits. Allow me to clarify the facts to address these misperceptions.There are insurance schemes that provide coverage for the year in which the policyholder pays his premiums – when the policyholder stops paying premiums, the coverage ends. ElderShield works differently. It collects premiums while the policyholder is aged 40 to 65, and provides lifetime coverage from age 40, even after the policyholder reaches 65 and stops paying premiums.Hence, it is prudent for the total amount of premiums collected to exceed the amount of claims paid while our policyholders are still young, because the premiums collected are meant to provide coverage against future claims throughout the policyholder's lifetime. As explained earlier, the proportion of claims over premiums collected has been increasing since 2002 and we can expect this trend to continue as the profile of our policyholders gets older over time. If the insurers do not collect enough premiums today and set aside some amounts for future claims, there is a risk that ElderShield will not be able to provide adequate coverage for policyholders as our population ages. It is important for insurers to ensure that policyholders will not face this situation."
additional help for people seeking social assistance given sluggish economy,"Mr Seah Kian Peng asked the Minister for Social and Family Development given the sluggish economy and uncertain outlook ahead, whether the Ministry has seen an increase in the number of people seeking social assistance and, if so, what additional measures will the Ministry be instituting to provide relief to this group of affected people.","Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: The number of applications for ComCare Short-to-Medium Term Assistance was 60,170 in 2015, and 57,694 in 2016. Over the four quarters in 2016, the number of applications has hovered around 14,000 to 15,000 per quarter, with no clear trend.MSF is closely monitoring the situation with regard to the number of households stepping forward for assistance and their profiles. MSF stands ready to provide additional support, just as we did during the 2009 global financial crisis. Let me share on some of these additional support measuresFirst, we are prepared to exercise greater flexibility in providing ComCare assistance to support households. For example, our SSO officers can provide retrenched workers with a longer duration of assistance if they require more time to find a job. This could be a result of external factors beyond the individual’s control, such as limited availability of job openings that fit his or her skillset.Second, we are prepared to step up our manpower temporarily at our SSOs if there are significant increases in applications for ComCare assistance, so that households in need continue to receive assistance in a timely manner.Third, our SSOs will also work with the Family Service Centres to assist recently retrenched clients who may require counselling and support.In addition, through an initiative by the National Council of Social Service, companies can engage social service organisations to deploy social service professionals on-site during restructuring exercises to provide support to those affected and information on community resources available.MSF will continue to monitor developments in the labour market closely, and work with Government agencies and community partners to provide support and assistance to individuals and families in need."
anti-terrorism and cpr/aed training for public transport workers under sg secure framework,"Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Home Affairs that as part of the SG Secure movement, (a) whether there are plans to incorporate compulsory anti-terrorism and CPR/AED training for existing and newly recruited public transport workers; and (b) if so, how often will refresher courses be conducted for these workers so that their knowledge and skills remain current.","Mr K Shanmugam: Since the launch of the SGSecure movement, MHA has been working closely with the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and the Public Transport Operators (PTO) to raise public transport workers’ awareness of the terrorism threat and to equip them with knowledge and skills to respond to an attack.The PTOs currently train some of their staff in first aid, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and the use of the automated external defibrillator (AED).MHA has worked with LTA to incorporate the SGSecure messages of vigilance, cohesion and resilience into the training curriculum for bus captains at the new Singapore Bus Academy. These messages have been included in the taxi driver vocational licence and refresher courses at the Singapore Taxi Academy. These knowledge and skills are also reinforced by the PTOs during their staff in-service or in-house training. We will continue to work with LTA and PTOs to incorporate emergency response skills into their training programmes.We are encouraged by the ground-up SGSecure initiatives by the transport industry community. For example, the National Transport Workers' Union organised a counter-terrorism seminar in December 2016 where 200 public transport workers learned how to prepare themselves for a terror attack. The National Taxi Association also organised a number of workshops in November and December last year which trained more than 100 taxi drivers in CPR, AED and first aid skills.MHA will continue to work with LTA and the PTOs to enhance the current training and outreach initiatives, including exercises that hone their preparedness in the event of a terror attack. One such example was Exercise Heartbeat which involved one of the PTOs conducted in September 2016 at Bishan Bus Interchange and Junction 8."
measures against hoarders who cause disamenities to neighbours,Mr Yee Chia Hsing asked the Minister for National Development what are the measures available against HDB dwellers (such as hoarders and cat hoarders) who cause great disamenities to their neighbours and do not open their premises for authorised inspection by HDB officers.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: When HDB receives feedback on hoarding in HDB flats, HDB will carry out an inspection. If excessive hoarding is found, the residents will be advised to remove the unwanted items, and reminded to keep their flat tidy. Most residents are generally cooperative.In hoarding cases where there may be regulatory breaches, HDB will work with the relevant agencies such as the Singapore Civil Defence Force (for fire hazards) and NEA (for vectors). In cases of compulsive hoarding, which could be an indication of an underlying behavioural issue and would require professional help, HDB also works with health and social work professionals to provide counselling and appropriate assistance to the hoarder. HDB also ropes in the grassroots leaders and the hoarder's family in an effort to reduce disamenities.As for feedback received on the keeping of cats, HDB will work with the flat owners and Animal Welfare Groups such as the Cat Welfare Society to re-home the cats. Recalcitrant owners, including owners who refuse to open up their premise for inspection by HDB officers, may be brought to court where they can be fined up to $4,000 upon conviction.In cases where there is reasonable cause to believe that the welfare of the cats is compromised, AVA has powers to enter the premises to investigate. The owners, if convicted in court for the offence of failure in duty of care, may be liable to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or both."
progress on construction sector's productivity roadmap and capability fund,"Dr Teo Ho Pin asked the Minister for National Development whether he can provide an update on (i) the progress of the Construction Productivity Roadmap by BCA and (ii) details of the Construction Productivity and Capability Fund including the total amount of funds disbursed to-date, the number of firms that have benefited from the fund, and the productivity improvements that such firms have made to-date, respectively.","Mr Lawrence Wong: The first Construction Productivity Roadmap was launched in 2010. We tightened the supply of lower skilled foreign manpower, required buildings to adopt more productive design, and supported firms as they invested in productive technologies and upgraded their workers. The second Roadmap was launched in 2015. It encourages even higher capital investments, intensifies our efforts to build up a quality workforce, and further facilitates collaboration among stakeholders across the construction value chain. Through the two Roadmaps, we have targeted a 20-30% improvement in construction site productivity by 2020.The results are encouraging. Annual site productivity increases have improved progressively from 0.3% in 2010 to 2.0% in 2015. A 2.0% increase is also projected for 2016. The cumulative site productivity improvement is about 10% since 2010.Almost $800 million is available to firms through the Construction Productivity and Capability Fund (CPCF). As of end 2016, about $450 million has been committed to over 9,000 firms in the built environment sector. 90% of these companies are small and medium-sized firms."
efforts to reintegrate destitute persons with their families and society,"Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) for each of the past three years, what has been (i) the number of destitute persons admitted into the custody of the Director of Social Welfare (""Director"") (ii) the numbers discharged from the Director's custody (iii) the number of discharged destitute persons re-admitted into the Director's custody; and (b) what steps are taken to encourage destitute persons to reintegrate with their families and society.","Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: The number of destitute persons admitted into Welfare Homes under the custody of the Director of Social Welfare was 250, 251 and 207 for 2014, 2015 and 2016 respectively.The number of destitute persons discharged from Welfare Homes was 182 in 2014, 172 in 2015 and 163 in 2016. These include persons who went on to independent living, and living with family or friends. These also include persons discharged to step-down residential care facilities and nursing homes.In 2014, 39 destitute persons were re-admitted into Welfare Homes. There were 42 re-admissions in 2015 and 27 re-admissions in 2016.Destitute persons who are admitted into Welfare Homes undergo rehabilitation programmes which impart social, work and life skills to prepare them for independent living in the community, whenever possible. Those who are assessed to have high potential for reintegration are placed on external employment, home leave and pre-discharge programmes to support their transition back to the community. They are also linked up with community resources where necessary to support their reintegration.In addition, Welfare Homes support family reconciliation to address underlying issues and strengthen family relationships. Volunteers and community agencies also work with Welfare Homes to complement their rehabilitative efforts."
electricity prices for singapore homes and businesses compared to oecd average,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) how does the price of electricity for (i) homes and (ii) businesses compare to the OECD average in each year from 2011 to 2015.,"Mr S Iswaran: Between 2011 to 2015, Singapore's regulated electricity tariffs were on average 23% higher than the OECD's average retail electricity costs.I would point out that such a comparison is of limited value because the OECD average includes a wide range of countries. They vary in terms of energy policy with some subsidising certain forms of electricity production (for example, in Germany, the US, and Spain). We do not subsidise electricity generation or consumption. The fuel mix is also varied among OECD countries with some having access to coal, nuclear energy, and renewables like hydropower. In contrast, 95% of electricity generation in Singapore uses natural gas imported at global prices. A comparison of average end-use prices for industrial users is even more challenging because, as observed by the International Energy Agency, industrial consumers can purchase electricity through private contracts instead of the regulated market, with variable and often confidential pricing arrangements.As an energy importer and price taker, Singapore cannot be insulated from movements in the global energy market. Our aim is to foster a competitive energy market for the benefit of all consumers."
trend of women being asked by employers not to return to work after maternity leave,"Ms Sun Xueling asked the Minister for Manpower in 2016, how many women have notified the Ministry that they have been asked by their employer not to return to work after the end of their maternity leave and whether this number shows an increasing trend in the past two years.","Mr Lim Swee Say: Termination of employment during maternity leave rarely occurs. The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) received one such complaint in 2016. The case involved an employee who was terminated as the employer's business had failed and ceased operations. With MOM's intervention, the employee was able to recover her maternity leave benefits. The employer has also been issued a stern warning. There is no indication that such cases are on the rise.Female employees are protected under the Employment Act and Child Development Co-savings Act. Those who have been unfairly dismissed during their pregnancy can appeal to MOM. If the dismissal is found to be without sufficient cause, MOM can order the employer to reinstate and/or compensate the employee. In addition, it is an offence to terminate the employment of an employee while she is on maternity leave. Such an offence carries a penalty of up to $5,000 fine and/or imprisonment of up to six months."
investigations into jallikattu-related events in singapore,"Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) how many individuals have been investigated and/or charged over Jallikattu-related events in Singapore; and (b) of this number, how many are Singaporeans, PRs and foreigners respectively.","Mr K Shanmugam: The Police are investigating nine incidents of public assembly without a permit relating to the Jallikattu movement. Jallikattu is a bull-taming event practiced in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu as part of the Pongal festival. It was initially banned in India, which led to protests in India and other countries.114 persons are under investigation by the Police for participating in these public assemblies without permits, of whom four are Singaporeans, 23 are Permanent Residents and 87 are foreigners. The incidents took place between 15 and 22 January 2017.We take a strong stand against the importation of foreign politics by foreigners into Singapore. Foreigners visiting or living in Singapore are to abide by our laws, and should not import the politics of their own countries into Singapore."
periodic assessment for service personnel who handle weapons,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan asked the Minister for Defence whether service personnel in roles which involve access to weapons and live ammunition are periodically re-assessed on the stability of their emotional and psychological state.,"Dr Ng Eng Hen: MINDEF/SAF recognises the importance of ensuring that all servicemen and women who handle live arms are of sound mind and physical capabilities. The SAF has in place various levels of checks to determine the psychological well-being of service personnel. Before enlistment, all pre-enlistees undergo a comprehensive medical screening at the Central Manpower Base for both physical and mental health conditions. Pre-enlistees are asked explicitly if they have a previous record of mental health conditions during the screening. In addition, we require the parent or guardian to endorse this declaration. There is a balance between privacy for the enlistee and potential safety concerns of those with previous mental health conditions. But since 2016, MINDEF/SAF has also been working with the Ministry of Health to identify pre-enlistees with records of mental health history at public hospitals. If a possible mental health condition is surfaced, the pre-enlistee will be referred to appropriate specialists to certify that that enlistee is mentally capable of performing their National Service duties and to handle firearms.A serviceman who is deemed unsuitable to handle firearms because of his emotional or psychological state are excused from such duties and re-deployed to vocations which do not require him to have access to weapons and live ammunition.SAF servicemen have avenues to obtain counselling or medical assistance, should they face any emotional or psychological distress, including a 24-hour SAF Counselling Hotline. Those diagnosed with mental health conditions are closely monitored while in service, and where necessary, are provided with regular medical treatment and counselling by psychiatrists, psychologists, counsellors and para-counsellors. We deploy dedicated psychologists at the formation level to assist commanders in the management of such servicemen. At the unit level, our commanders interview all servicemen at regular intervals to find out if they are facing any stresses, including emotional or psychological problems. Commanders also undergo basic training to help them better understand mental health conditions, so that they can try to identify and manage servicemen with such conditions, including referring them to trained professionals for more assistance, or restricting their access to weapons and ammunition.MINDEF and the SAF will continue to periodically review and strengthen the mental health system, in consultation with the SAF Psychiatry Specialist Advisory Board, which comprises senior psychiatrists drawn from public healthcare institutions, to ensure that all our servicemen are able to discharge their duties and at the same time, to receive good emotional and mental health care."
incidence of postal letters delivered to wrong address,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) how often are postal letters delivered to the wrong address; (b) what action is being taken to improve the service; (c) what are the common reasons for the wrong delivery; and (d) whether any fine-tuning on the sorting process of letters and training of postmen are required.,"Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim: Postal delivery in Singapore is regulated by the Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA). Under IMDA's Postal Quality of Service (QoS) framework, SingPost needs to deliver 99% of local basic letters destined for the Central Business District (CBD) by the next working day, and 98% of local basic letters destined for non-CBD areas. SingPost is also required to achieve 100% delivery by the second working day. These are one of the most stringent standards for local basic mail in the world.SingPost delivers more than three million items a day. In 2016, SingPost received about 50 incidents of feedback concerning mis-delivered local basic letters.This is a significant improvement from 279 incidents of feedback concerning mis-delivered local basic letters in 2013 and 155 in 2015. Letters are mis-delivered for several reasons – the postman could have delivered the letter to the wrong letter box; or the address could have been incomplete or incorrectly written.While the number of mis-deliveries is very small, IMDA takes a serious view of all cases as they inconvenience businesses and individuals. IMDA works closely with SingPost to reduce mis-delivery rates, and improve their quality of service. In that regard, SingPost has taken active steps in the last few years to improve its service qualitya. In 2014, SingPost invested $45 million on sorting machines to improve mail sorting efficiency and accuracy.b. SingPost has enhanced its staff training programme, which includes the postmen code of conduct, on-the-job training and customer service training. Since 2014, SingPost has hired quality control officers to further ensure that letters are correctly delivered.c. Finally, as part of its ongoing efforts to engage senders of letters, SingPost provides a 24/7 customer care hotline and has service ambassadors stationed at post offices. SingPost also regularly updates its website with mailing guidelines and tips on addressing letters.The drop in number of complaints over the last three years show that these efforts have been helpful. Nevertheless, IMDA will continue to monitor SingPost's performance, and review the Postal QoS framework, to ensure that SingPost continues to provide reliable and quality postal services for Singapore."
ensuring safety of sigma lifts installed for hdb flats,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for National Development (a) what steps is the Ministry taking or has taken to ensure that the Sigma lifts currently in operation are safe to use; and (b) whether it will be taking any action against Sigma and its parent company.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: MND takes a serious view on the safety of lifts in Singapore. HDB has in place a comprehensive set of measures spanning lift procurement, installation and maintenance to ensure that lifts in HDB blocks are safe and fit for operation. In particular, lifts are procured through open tenders, and the evaluation process factors in quality and reliability of lift contractors. Audits, stress-tests and inspections in the presence of an independent Authorised Examiner (AE) are also conducted as part of a well-established lift commissioning process.Sigma has been installing lifts in HDB estates for the past 10 years, and has generally met the prescribed performance standards. However, for a recent batch contract awarded to Sigma in 2013, Sigma was unable to meet the timeline for lift installation. Hence in late 2015, HDB restricted Sigma from tendering for new HDB lift contracts, to ensure that Sigma dedicated its resources to fulfil its contractual obligations. HDB also observed a higher-than-usual breakdown and fault rate in lifts from this batch contract in their first year of operations. The tender restriction has therefore not been lifted, and will continue until performance standards improve.HDB's investigations revealed that while the design and installation of the affected lifts complied with prevailing codes and standards, the doors and sensors were more susceptible to misalignment from knocks. This, coupled with frequent heavy and rough lift usage during the first year period due to renovation and moving activities, resulted in the higher lift faults.HDB has instructed Sigma to rectify these issues and to carry out improvement works to ensure that the lift doors and sensors operate smoothly. HDB has also issued stern warnings to Sigma, and is closely monitoring the performance of its lifts.Both Sigma and its parent company have channelled more resources towards addressing the issues. In particular, Sigma has undertaken the rectification works progressively, and the performance of the lifts has improved. HDB will continue to hold Sigma accountable for ensuring its lifts meet the required performance standards."
study on legislating eldercare leave,"Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the outcome of the Ministry's study on legislating eldercare leave for employees; (b) what are the barriers that impede legislation of eldercare leave; and (c) from 2012-2017, how many working caregivers do not have eldercare leave and how many working caregivers quit work to care for an elderly family member full-time.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: We recognise that caregiving is an important responsibility and is no easy feat, particularly for those who have to juggle between work and caregiving roles. The Ministry of Health has strengthened efforts to support caregivers by expanding the capacity of aged care services and the number of home and community care options.We have been studying the issue of legislating eldercare leave in consultation with unions and employers. On balance, we are not ready to legislate eldercare leave at this time, as we need to strike a balance between employers' concerns on business costs and manpower constraints, and the employability of caregivers, versus the need for additional leave provision for eldercare purposes. There are existing leave provisions that can be used for this purpose.According to MOM's Comprehensive Labour Force Survey, some 176,200 females aged 25 to 54 were outside of the labour force in 2016, of which 10% were due to caregiving for family members or relatives. In relation to that, we encourage companies to provide more family-related leave benefits which can be used for different purposes, as well as flexible work arrangements. We track this provision and the trends have been encouraging thus far.Sixty-seven percent of employees work in companies that offer at least one formal flexible work arrangement last year, up from 56% in 2011. Close to eight in 10 employers also provide unplanned time-off or ad-hoc teleworking for their employees to attend to personal matters.Public service agencies currently already provide two days of parent care leave per year. Some private companies have also done so. OCBC offers two days of family care to employees who are not entitled to childcare leave. Cerebos Pacific Limited, a manufacturing company, also offers family care leave on top of statutory leave.We will continue to review the need for legislating eldercare leave as our socio-economic circumstances evolve over time."
activities to encourage secondary school students to take calculated risks,Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for Education (Schools) (a) whether there are plans to introduce more activities that will encourage secondary school students to think out-of-the-box; and (b) how can schools help to imbue in the students the spirit to take on calculated risks.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: To better prepare our students to thrive in the future, MOE has identified a set of 21st Century Competencies to develop in all students. Critical and Inventive Thinking is one of the competencies to be developed. By nurturing our students to be more inventive in their thinking, they will be more ready to think out of the box.Critical and Inventive Thinking is developed through both the academic curriculum and the co-curricular programmes. Our efforts in this area have been building up steadily over the years.During lessons, teachers stimulate curiosity and creativity in their students through the use of inquiry-based pedagogies, and novel and open-ended learning tasks. Such approaches encourage students to challenge assumptions, explore new possibilities and embrace uncertainties. Such dispositions are also nurtured through authentic learning experiences in Values-in-Action projects and Co-Curricular Activities, where students have to identify problems that need to be solved and come up with creative solutions.We have also been providing students with more opportunities for applied learning. This will enable them to apply skills and knowledge gained in the classroom to address real-world problems. Examples of such opportunities include the Applied Learning Programme and Learning for Life Programme in primary and secondary schools, as well as Advanced Elective Modules and Applied Subjects in secondary schools.To help students grow in their confidence to take calculated risks, our schools seek to provide a learning environment where students can feel safe to make choices, try new ideas and recover from setbacks. We need to help students find more intrinsic motivations in their learning so that they are driven more by a sense of passion. As our schools continue to strengthen their efforts in nurturing such traits in students, we recognise that such cultural shifts will take time and need to be reinforced at home."
public education on responsible pet ownership,Mr Darryl David asked the Minister for National Development whether the Government will take stronger action against recalcitrant residents who flout HDB rules on pets as the incessant noise and unpleasant animal smells affect the surrounding environment and residents.,"25 Mr Seah Kian Peng asked the Minister for National Development in light of the high proportion of pet-related complaints that HDB receives, whether more can be done to educate pet owners about responsibility and due care of their pets.Mr Lawrence Wong: In high-rise, high-density Singapore, and especially in our housing estates, it is important for Singaporeans to be both responsible pet owners and considerate neighbours. Pet owners are wholly responsible for ensuring that their pets are well cared for, and that they do not adversely affect the wider living environment.AVA has focused its efforts on raising public awareness about responsible pet ownership. For the younger generation, AVA holds two to three school talks and learning journeys every month. AVA is also developing a pre-school kit for kindergarten teachers to educate their students on animal care and welfare. For the broader community, AVA conducts responsible pet ownership roadshows every year. These roadshows include interactive displays, children’s activities, competitions, talks and workshops. The most recent roadshow at Waterway Point in December 2016 attracted 12,000 attendees.In the event that pets are causing a nuisance, HDB officers would advise the flat owners to take measures to stop the nuisance. Where necessary, parties concerned are also advised to attend mediation to resolve the issue amicably. In most cases, this improves the situation. For recalcitrant owners whose pets persistently cause disamenity, they may be required to re-home their pets with assistance from animal welfare groups. As a last resort, recalcitrant owners may be brought to court, where upon conviction, they can be fined up to $4,000."
awareness amongst school leaders for importance of tripartism,"Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Education (Schools) (a) whether there are efforts made to familiarise senior management and school leaders on the importance of tripartism and its role in creating an environment conducive for Singapore's growth; and (b) whether the Ministry has plans to collaborate with NTUC and its affiliated unions, through its current zonal-level sharing platforms, to understand and strengthen knowledge in tripartism further.","Mr Ng Chee Meng: MOE's senior management recognises the importance of tripartism for Singapore. At the Ministry level, there is strong partnership between MOE senior officials and the unions representing our employees. These include four teachers’ unions (Singapore Teachers' Union, Singapore Chinese Teachers' Union, Singapore Malay Teachers' Union and Singapore Tamil Teachers' Union) and the Amalgamated Union for Public Employees (AUPE). Regular dialogues are conducted, during which the Ministry shares its plans and policies with the unions, and the unions share their ideas, plans and feedback with Ministry officials. Collaboration opportunities are also discussed during these dialogue sessions.To reinforce the importance of tripartism among our school leaders, we have introduced a labour-management relations module in the leadership programme for senior educators. This newly introduced module helps senior educators to better understand the role of tripartism in Singapore and how strong employee-management relations in MOE help contribute to a strong education system.The Member of Parliament has suggested that MOE strengthen knowledge of tripartism through its zonal-sharing platforms. I am glad to share that MOE has been engaging our cluster superintendents to enhance their understanding on the role of tripartism and our collaboration with the unions."
population trend for stray cats,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling asked the Minister for National Development (a) how does AVA monitor the population of stray cats in housing estates; (b) what is the population trend of stray cats over past three years; (c) what measures are put in place to manage its population; and (d) what actions are taken against irresponsible cat feeders.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: AVA does not track the population of stray cats. But AVA works with the Cat Welfare Society (CWS) and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) on stray cat sterilisation. Efforts are also made to try to rehome stray cats, although this is not feasible in all cases.Under the Stray Cat Sterilisation Programme (SCSP), AVA subsidises the cost of sterilising and micro-chipping stray cats in HDB estates, industrial and commercial areas, as well as in private housing estates. Through these efforts, the annual number of feedback cases on stray cats has dropped from more than 4,000 in 2014 to fewer than 3,000 in 2016.AVA also works with CWS and the SPCA to educate community feeders to feed stray cats responsibly. This includes placing food in receptacles and clearing up after the feeding. If these conditions are not adhered to, irresponsible feeders can be fined up to $2,000, $4,000 and $10,000 for their first, second and subsequent convictions for littering."
completion of new bukit panjang polyclinic,"Dr Teo Ho Pin asked the Minister for Health whether he can provide an update on the progress of the construction of the Bukit Panjang Polyclinic, its scheduled completion date and details of its range of medical services.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Bukit Panjang Polyclinic is being developed as part of a larger healthcare facility that also includes a nursing home and a senior care centre. Design of the Polyclinic is in progress, and physical construction is scheduled to begin by early 2018. The Polyclinic is targeted to begin operations by end 2020.Like other polyclinics, the new Bukit Panjang Polyclinic will provide a suite of services, including medical treatment for acute conditions, chronic disease management, women's and children's health services as well as radiological, laboratory and pharmacy services. We are also planning for dental services to be available at this new Polyclinic."
resolution of signalling problems along circle line,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Transport in respect of the recent signalling problems with the Circle Line caused by signal interference, what measures will be taken to ensure that commuters are not inconvenienced by the same signalling problems again.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The signalling problem experienced on the Circle Line was caused by a hardware malfunction on one of the trains. The faulty component has been replaced and the train has since been returned to service under close supervision. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) is working with the signalling equipment manufacturer ALSTOM to determine why the component failed, and whether the problem extends to the entire batch of components manufactured. If so, LTA will require ALSTOM to replace all of them.Based on the findings, LTA will also develop targeted measures to prevent an occurrence of similar problems on both the Circle Line and North-East Line, which use older signalling systems. LTA is also exploring ways to improve the general resilience of these systems. This includes shielding the signalling antenna against spurious signals, incorporating a feature for a backup antenna if the primary one encounters interference, and improving the signal transmission protocol.The newer signalling systems used for the Downtown Line, and to be installed for the North-South and East-West Lines and the Thomson-East Coast Line, would not be affected by the signalling problem experienced by the Circle Line as they have enhanced redundancy features to guard against signal interference."
age limit for clinical trial for pre-implantation genetic screening,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Health (a) what are the reasons for setting the criteria disallowing women below the age of 35 to take part in the three-year clinical trial for Pre-Implantation Genetic Screening (PGS); (b) whether the Ministry will consider lowering this age limit for women; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider allowing women below the age of 35 to take part on a case-by-case basis.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Pre-Implantation Genetic Screening (PGS) is a test for chromosomal abnormalities in embryos created through in vitro fertilisation (IVF), before the embryos are implanted into the uterus. MOH recently approved a three-year pilot for PGS. This will commence at the National University Hospital (NUH) in 2017.Under the pilot programme, patients who fulfil at least one of the following clinical criteria will be eligiblea. Age 35 years old and above, regardless of prognosisb. Two or more recurrent implantation failures, regardless of agec. Two or more recurrent pregnancy losses, regardless of ageIn other words, women of any age can participate in the pilot if they have had two or more recurrent implantation failures or pregnancy losses. For those without recurrent implantation failures or pregnancy losses, the minimum age is set at 35 years. This is because literature evidence and overseas experience have shown that the chance of a baby born with chromosomal abnormalities for mothers aged 35 and above is significantly higher. Countries such as the UK and Canada have similarly recommended that PGS be made available to women aged 35 years and above, regardless of prognosis."
simpler language in skills training course materials to cater to older workers,Dr Tan Wu Meng asked the Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) whether skills training course materials are vetted for plain and simple language so as to keep courses as open as possible to older workers with limited language skills.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: SSG has a quality assurance system in place to ensure that the development and delivery of WSQ courses and the assessment of trainees meet required standards. SSG also conducts regular audits to ensure that the accredited training providers continue to have robust systems in place to deliver quality training.Having said that, while SSG regulates the skills standards, how the lessons are conducted and what training materials to use, are the responsibility of training providers. Such an approach allows more scope for innovation and differentiation in training products, and more market competition. Some methods that training providers have employed include the use of simple phrases in the course materials, oral assessments, pictures, videos and/or demonstrations to illustrate certain concepts. Training providers are also encouraged to contextualise their courses to meet their learners’ needs.In addition, given that basic literacy and numeracy skills are critical for employability, SSG has worked with training providers to develop the Workplace Literacy and Workplace Numeracy programmes under the WSQ system. Workers who face language barriers can better equip themselves through such training to undertake the wider range of training opportunities, and better apply their skills in the workplace."
payment for failed erp deductions without incurring administrative fee,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for Transport whether he will consider allowing motorists to make payments for failed ERP deductions electronically within a reasonable period of time after the failed deduction without incurring the administrative fee or incurring a less punitive fee.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Motorists who make good their failed ERP deductions within two weeks of the date of the letter from LTA are required to pay an administrative fee to cover the cost of processing the ERP violation, notification and payment. This fee is $10 if they make their payment through cash or cheque, and $8 if they make the payment electronically as the administrative cost incurred is lower. It will not be fair for taxpayers to bear these costs on the motorists’ behalf.To avoid incurring such costs for failed ERP deductions, motorists should sign up to payment services such as Motorpay, vCashCard or EZ-Pay. Using such services, motorists do not need to insert a cash-card into their car’s in-vehicle unit before they pass under an ERP gantry. ERP charges are automatically charged to their credit card based on the ERP system’s identification of the in-vehicle unit."
"review width of footpaths given shared usage by pedestrians, cyclists and users of personal mobility devices",Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Transport given that bicycles and personal mobility devices (PMDs) will share the use of footpaths together with pedestrians (a) what are the criteria used to determine whether an existing footpath will be widened; (b) what is the recommended minimum width for footpaths to ensure safe shared usage between cyclists and pedestrians; and (c) whether Ministry will conduct an islandwide review to ensure that existing footpaths which are often used by cyclists and PMD users are widened in accordance with this minimum width.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Today, most of our footpaths are at least 1.5 metres wide. Footpaths near town centres and MRT stations are generally wider, between 2.4 metres and 3.6 metres, to accommodate more pedestrians and cyclists. It is not always possible to widen footpaths, due to site constraints like existing trees and utilities. LTA also builds dedicated cycling lanes, which are generally 2 metres wide. More of such lanes will be built as part of our plans to have a cycling path network in every HDB town by 2030."
feedback from implementation of courtesy crossing under silver zone initiative,"Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for Transport (a) what are the positive and negative experience and feedback gathered on the implementation of the ""Courtesy Crossing"" under the Silver Zone initiative; and (b) what is the number of Silver Zones with public bus stops but with no bus lay-by.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The feedback on the courtesy crossing has been mostly positive. We have also received some feedback from users who are unsure about how to use these crossings. We will continue to publicise and educate pedestrians and motorists on how to use these crossings.Eight of our nine Silver Zones today contain public bus stops with no bus lay-by. The majority of these bus stops are on two-lane roads. For those that are on one lane roads, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) has assessed that the impediment to traffic is only momentary, even with the Silver Zone measures."
government measures to support building and construction industry slowdown,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development what measures will the Government take to support the building and construction industry which is facing challenging times in the face of an economic slowdown.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: We understand the concerns about the slowdown in construction demand in 2016. At $26 billion, the quantum of building and civil engineering contracts in 2016 was $1 billion less than 2015. The contraction came from reduced private sector demand. But this was partially offset by strong public sector demand.Total construction demand this year is projected to be between $28 to $35 billion. This is more than 2016. However, private sector demand is expected to remain subdued. The Government will help offset this shortfall by pushing out a pipeline of public sector projects. In doing so, public sector demand may increase to almost 70% of total construction demand this year. Significant public sector projects that we will roll out include phase 2 of the Deep Tunnel Sewerage System, the North-South Corridor, Changi Airport Terminal 5, and new MRT lines.In tandem, we will continue to assist firms through various funding support schemes to help them adopt productive technologies and upgrade their workforce capabilities. Almost $800 million has been made available to firms through the Construction Productivity and Capability Fund (CPCF). As of November 2016, more than $420 million has been committed to fund projects by more than 8,600 firms in the built environment sector. Around 90% of these companies are small and medium-sized firms.We will also do more to help our firms venture overseas. In the past three years, Singapore contractors managed to clinch an average of $1.7 billion per year in overseas projects. This is very encouraging but there is potential for even more growth given the increasing regional demand for quality housing and infrastructure. Internationalisation will be one of the focus areas for the Industry Transformation Map (ITM) for the construction sector that MND and BCA are currently developing with our industry."
number of foreign domestic workers who have undergone basic eldercare course,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Health (a) how many foreign domestic workers (FDWs) have undergone the Agency for Integrated Care's Basic Eldercare Course; (b) what percentage of FDWs subsidised by the FDW grant and who are caring for elderly Singaporeans have undergone the course; and (c) how many FDWs have been trained under the eldercarer training scheme and have been deployed.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Government has several schemes to support households with seniors with caregiving needs. For example, the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) administers the Caregiver’s Training Grant (CTG), which has been in place since 2007. This provides caregivers, including Foreign Domestic Workers (FDW), with up to $200 each year to attend suitable training courses on useful caregiving skills. To date, about 37,000 caregivers, including around 20,000 FDWs, have benefited from the CTG.The FDW Grant (FDWG), which was introduced in 2012, supports lower and middle income families who need to hire a FDW to care for frail seniors and persons with moderate disabilities with a monthly grant of $120. 6,800 households caring for seniors are currently receiving the FDWG and all of them have either attended a CTG-approved course, or have received training at the hospitals. Of these, 4,400 tapped on the CTG for the training.The Basic Eldercare Course is one of the courses supported under the CTG. It is a relatively new course that was started in late 2015. Since then, 167 FDWs have attended the course. Of these, 52 were employed by households also receiving the FDWG.Leveraging on the Basic Eldercare Course, MOH and AIC started the Eldercarer FDW Scheme in November 2016. This enables households to employ FDWs who have been pre-trained in eldercare prior to placements with the families. Over two months, about 30 FDWs have been trained under the scheme, of which 25 have been placed with families. MOH and AIC are working with employment agencies, and healthcare and social service organisations to raise awareness of this new scheme so that we can serve more families with eldercare needs."
"duration of government contracts for clean, green and safe sectors","Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Finance (a) what is the average length of Government agencies' contracts for procurement services in the three traditionally outsourced clean, green and safe sectors; (b) what has been the shortest and longest contracts that have been given out by the Government; and (c) how does the Government determine the appropriate length for each of the contracts.","Mr Heng Swee Keat: Contract periods vary depending on factors such as the needs of the buyer agency, the scale or complexity of the contract and industry acceptance.Among the three sectors, the shortest contract in the past three years was a transitional cleaning contract. It was for a period of six months and is an exception as the agency was to be relocated after that. The longest contract awarded was for seven years, as the Government agency had assessed that a longer contract was needed to enable the service provider to recoup the high capital investments needed for the contract.While longer contracts allow service providers more time to get familiar with the contractual requirements, and justify investments in equipment or technology, contracts that are too long can introduce business risks for service providers and can be unattractive to them. So a balance needs to be struck. The vast majority of contracts in the cleaning, security and landscaping sectors have a base period of between two to five years, with an average duration of about 2.7 years. In addition, many contracts also come with options to extend for a pre-determined duration if the service provider has done well, and the needs of the agency have not changed. For instance, a cleaning contract can have a base period of three years, with an option to extend for another two years."
measures to reduce food waste,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what plans are in place to reduce the amount of food waste generated in light of 785.5 million kilogrammes of food waste being generated in 2015; (b) what are the top contributing factors of food wastage; and (c) what are the targeted approaches to be undertaken by the Ministry to tackle each contributing factor effectively.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Food waste is a concern to my Ministry. When we throw away food, we waste the resources used in its production and expand manpower and resources for waste collection and cleaning. Food waste, when not properly managed, causes odour and pest issues. It also contaminates recyclable materials when they are mixed. Besides the environmental impact, wasting food is a waste of money.The amount of food waste in Singapore has increased by about 50 per cent over the past ten years. Households generate around half of the food waste, with the other half generated by sources such as food manufacturers, hotels, shopping malls and hawker centres. We can expect the amount of food waste to rise further as population size, incomes and economic activities increase.Unfortunately, there is no easy solution to this problem. My Ministry believes that a multi-pronged approach should be adopted to combat food waste. This starts with avoiding, where possible, excess food production. Where this is not possible, we encourage the re-distribution of excess food. Lastly, we encourage food waste to be segregated for recycling and treatment. Food waste segregation is an important step that reduces the likelihood of recyclable contamination and enhances the effectiveness of our recycling efforts.My Ministry works closely with other Government agencies and private sector partners to combat food waste in the non-household sector. In October 2016, the National Environment Agency (NEA) and the Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA) launched a food waste minimisation guidebook for food retail establishments, with the aim of sharing good practices, such as smart planning and inventory management, to avoid food waste and save costs. To promote food redistribution, guidelines on the proper handling and re-distribution of unsold and excess food have also been incorporated. People sector organisations, such as Food Bank Singapore and Food from the Heart, also play an important role to re-distribute food to those in need.My Ministry is experimenting with different models to implement on-site food waste treatment to reduce the road traffic created to transport food waste to our waste disposal facilities. Food waste is treated on site at the hawker centres at Block 628 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 4 and Tiong Bahru. We have taken this one step further at Our Tampines Hub, where up to 1.4 tonnes of food waste generated from the hawker centre and food and beverage (F&B) outlets can be recycled each day into non-potable water and fertilizer. The NEA has also supported the installation of on-site food waste treatment systems at 19 premises under its 3R Fund, including Resorts World Sentosa, Mandarin Orchard and Amara Hotel.We are also experimenting with district-level food waste treatment. Since last month, our partners comprising selected army camps, schools and food centres have been segregating their food waste at source. This food waste is then sent to a demonstration facility located at the Ulu Pandan Water Reclamation Plant for co-digestion with used water sludge to produce biogas.Households are major contributors of food waste in Singapore. The NEA launched a public education campaign in 2015 to increase awareness of the food waste situation and promote ways to reduce food wastage. These include tips on planning food purchases, food storage and food preparation habits to help consumers minimise food wastage while saving money. The NEA also partnered the North East Community Development Council (CDC) to launch the 'I Love My Food @ North East' initiative in November last year. My Ministry welcomes more stakeholders to come on board to undertake food waste reduction initiatives in the community.We are also studying the experiences of others closely, while being mindful of our local context. For example, households in Taipei segregate their food waste from other household waste before disposal. Some states in Australia have turned to technological solutions instead, such as in-sink grinders for food waste. We will monitor these best practices overseas, and hope to seek the support of Members to partner us in these efforts. Together, I hope that we can gradually change the attitudes and habits of households to reduce food waste."
radicalisation of foreign domestic workers,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked the Minister for Home Affairs if he can give an update on the reported radicalisation of some foreign domestic workers in Singapore and what is the Ministry's approach on handling this issue as well as planned future interventions.,"Mr K Shanmugam: In the past two years, seven foreign domestic workers in Singapore were found to have been radicalised through the internet. They did not have plans to carry out acts of violence in Singapore at the time they were investigated. However, their interactions with others showed that they had bought into radical ideologies and were on a dangerous path. Their presence in Singapore posed a security concern. They were repatriated to their home countries.Our security agencies will continue to monitor the situation closely and will investigate individuals in Singapore who are suspected of being radicalised, both foreign and local. As part of the global counter-terrorism effort, our agencies actively share intelligence with foreign security partners to tackle this transnational threat.The public must also play a part in protecting Singapore against the terrorism threat. The public should promptly alert the authorities if they notice signs that someone is becoming radicalised."
singapore's economic growth trend and progress on productivity and innovation adoption,Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) whether he can provide an update on the state of the Singapore economy including progress on productivity growth and the country's traction in its pivot towards innovation and technology as the next phase of development.,"Mr S Iswaran: Based on advance estimates, the Singapore economy grew by 1.8 per cent on a year-on-year basis in the fourth quarter of 2016, faster than the 1.2 per cent growth in the previous quarter. Growth was supported primarily by the recovery in the manufacturing sector. For the whole of 2016, the economy expanded by 1.8 per cent, slower than the 2.0 per cent recorded in 2015.For this year, MTI's current assessment is that Singapore’s growth should pick up slightly but remain modest. Although global growth is projected to improve marginally, the elasticity of trade to global growth is likely to remain weak due to factors such as the slowdown in investment growth in major advanced economies and China, as well as insourcing trends in China. This suggests that external demand for Singapore and regional countries may not see a significant uplift this year. Nonetheless, there are bright spots in the economy such as the education, health & social services, and information and communications sectors, which are likely to continue to see healthy growth. On balance, MTI expects the Singapore economy to grow by 1.0 to 3.0 per cent in 2017.Ms Foo has also asked for an update on our productivity performance. As productivity is highly pro-cyclical for a small open economy like Singapore, we should consider our productivity performance over a longer time horizon. Between 2009 and 2015, productivity, as measured by real value-added per actual hour worked, grew by 2.7 per cent per annum.In more recent years, productivity grew at a slower pace of 0.6 per cent per annum from 2011 to 2015. The slower growth was partly due to the sluggish external environment, which had dampened productivity growth not just in Singapore but also in other developed economies. Our productivity growth has also been weighed down by the weak productivity performance of domestically-oriented sectors such as construction and food services, as well as a shift in employment towards these sectors. Notably, the productivity of domestically-oriented sectors contracted by 0.5 per cent from 2011 to 2015, even as that of the outward-oriented sectors grew by 2.4 per cent.The Government has been working with the tripartite partners to raise productivity across sectors under key initiatives such as the Industry Transformation Maps. Our productivity measures are gaining traction. For example, construction site productivity growth improved steadily from 0.3 per cent in 2010 to 2.0 per cent in 2015. More companies are also heeding the call to raise productivity. According to the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry’s annual SME survey, the proportion of SMEs taking steps to raise productivity has increased from 84 per cent in 2013 to around 88 per cent in 2016.Promoting research, innovation and enterprise (or RIE) is another key plank of our strategy to maintain Singapore's economic competitiveness. Under the RIE2020 plan, $19 billion has been set aside to spur RIE in Singapore between 2016 and 2020. This includes support for companies to establish and expand corporate research laboratories in Singapore, as well as equity financing for technology start-ups. Our RIE efforts have gained momentum over the years. For instance, private sector expenditure on research and development (R&D) reached $5.2 billion in 2014, the highest level to-date. Of this, expenditure by local enterprises saw the most rapid growth, increasing by 23 per cent from $1.4 billion in 2013 to $1.7 billion in 2014. The number of high-tech start-ups has also risen from 2,700 in 2005 to 4,800 in 2015.To position Singapore for our next phase of growth, the Government will continue to push ahead with our restructuring efforts, with a strong emphasis on productivity and innovation."
assessment of deployment of driverless vehicles for public transport,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked the Minister for Transport whether he can provide the latest update and details pertaining to driverless vehicles for use in our public transportation system.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Self-driving technology indeed has the potential to transform public transport. For example, self-driving buses can help address the shortage of bus drivers. Self-driving pods or shuttles can be deployed at the neighbourhood level to further improve the first and last mile of a public transport journey. Commuters can summon these vehicles using their smartphones, and the vehicles will bring them in air-conditioned comfort from their doorsteps to the train station. This will be especially useful for the elderly, families with young children, and the less mobile.Over the last two years, MOT has signed agreements with various private companies and research institutes to develop and trial such self-driving technologies and concepts. Nanyang Technological University (NTU) is developing self-driving buses for Singapore’s roads and climatic conditions. We expect the first on-road testing of NTU's self-driving buses to commence by the middle of 2018. A*STAR, Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART), Delphi Automotive Systems and nuTonomy are currently conducting self-driving trials in one-north Business Park which would be useful for first and last mile application. ST Engineering and Sentosa Development Corporation will be trialing a fleet of self-driving vehicles to ferry visitors within Sentosa, as Gardens by the Bay had done. Plans are underway for more trials.There have been significant and rapid advances in self-driving technology, and we expect it to be mature enough for widespread deployment in 10 to 15 years. Meanwhile, we will continue to press ahead with trials and limited deployment."
tracking of zika cases and after-effects,"Mr Ang Wei Neng asked the Minister for Health (a) whether he can provide an update on the spread of the Zika virus in Singapore; (b) how many new Zika cases have been reported in November and December 2016; (c) how many of these cases are of pregnant women; and (d) what is the total number of pregnant women infected by the Zika virus in Singapore and of these, how many have given birth and whether any of these babies have birth defects.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: As at 31 December 2016, 458 Zika cases have been reported to the Ministry of Health. The incidence of new reported cases has been on the decline. 12 cases were reported in November and four cases were reported in December. In comparison, 283 cases and 43 cases were reported in September and October respectively.As of 31 December 2016, a total of 17 pregnant women have been diagnosed with Zika and reported to MOH. Four of the women have since given birth, and their babies show no signs of abnormalities thus far. One had a miscarriage for reasons not linked to Zika while two pregnancies were terminated for personal reasons. As the two foetuses were at early gestation, it is not possible to determine whether there will be Zika-related abnormalities. The remaining 10 cases are in their 2nd and 3rd trimesters and their babies will be monitored over three years as part of the monitoring programme. There is currently no obvious evidence to show that there are any Zika-related abnormalities.MOH has put in place a programme to monitor infants whose mothers were exposed to the Zika virus during their pregnancies. We will track their development until they are three years old.Given the presence of the Aedes mosquito here in Singapore, we are likely to continue to have Zika cases in Singapore. Some of these cases may be undiagnosed as the infection may result in mild or even no symptoms. I urge fellow Singaporeans to remain vigilant, and to do our part to prevent mosquito breeding so as to protect ourselves and our loved ones."
amount of operating subsidy for public bus operators in 2017 under bus contracting model,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether he can provide an update on the implementation of the bus contracting model; and (b) what is the estimated amount of operating subsidy that LTA is prepared to provide for the bus industry in 2017 and of which, how much is attributed to the lower bus fare with effect from 30 December 2016.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Our public bus industry fully transitioned to the bus contracting model in September 2016. This includes the two packages of bus services awarded to Tower Transit and Go Ahead through open tenders and the twelve packages that are operated by the incumbent operators, SBST and SMRT. Over time, the operators of the twelve packages will also be appointed through open tenders, starting with that of the Seletar package to be awarded in 1Q 2017.Service levels have improved under the contracting model. Bus services now operate at scheduled headways of 15 minutes or less during peak hours. As operators compete for bus captains with improved remunerations and working conditions, more Singaporeans have been attracted to the industry. The number of Singaporean bus captains has increased from around 2,400 to 3,000 over the past year.All these improvements have, however, increased operating costs and public subsidies. After factoring in the recent fare reduction, we expect to incur $3.5 to $4 billion in subsidies for bus services over the next five years. To prevent the subsidies from ballooning over time, we will continue to impose cost discipline on the operators through regular competitive tenders, and also through regular rationalisation of bus services, where ridership is low and the commuters have shifted to new MRT lines. We must also maintain price discipline through regular fare adjustments."
minimise sale of beverages with high sugar and caffeine content in school canteens,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Education (Schools) (a) what are the steps taken to minimise the sale of beverages that are high in sugar and caffeine content in government school canteens; and (b) whether there are guidelines on the nutritional value and types of food and beverages allowed for sale in tertiary institutions.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: The food and beverages (F&B) sold in school canteens must comply with the Health Promotion Board's (HPB’s) guidelines. In particular, only drinks with sugar content equal to or less than 6 g/100 ml are allowed to be sold. This is a reduction from the previous guideline of 7 g/100 ml. Our teachers encourage students to drink plain water and schools have installed water fountains for their convenience.HPB's other guidelines require stallholders to use healthier ingredients and to include four food groups – carbohydrates, proteins, fruit and vegetables. There are no guidelines on caffeine.Similarly, our Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) are actively working with HPB and their F&B operators to provide and promote healthier options on campus. Healthier options include lower calorie meals, meals with higher nutrition value (eg, wholegrains) and lower sugar beverages.Currently, over 50 F&B outlets, representing about 30% of the total number of F&B outlets at the IHLs, offer healthier options under the HPB’s Healthier Dining Programme. The IHLs are working with the other F&B outlets to increase participation in this programme."
complaint against em services for refusal to supply lift components,Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Trade) (a) when did the Competition Commission of Singapore first receive a complaint alleging that EM Services Pte Ltd was refusing to supply lift parts for the maintenance of lifts in HDB estates; and (b) which other companies were investigated by the Commission.,"Mr Lim Hng Kiang: The Competition Commission of Singapore (CCS) first received a complaint against E M Services Pte Ltd (E M Services) in April 2014. After a preliminary enquiry, CCS commenced investigations. CCS subsequently conveyed its initial findings to E M Services. In September 2015, E M Services voluntarily committed to CCS that it would supply lift spare parts to any purchaser such as third party lift maintenance contractors. In assessing E M Services' commitments, CCS conducted public consultations and market tests to ensure that the commitments sufficiently addressed the competition concerns highlighted. In May 2016, CCS accepted E M Services' signed commitment. The duration of CCS' investigations in this case is similar to its past 3 investigations on Asia Pacific Breweries Singapore, Cordlife and Coca Cola which involved voluntary commitments.The investigations into the other companies are still ongoing and CCS does not name entities which are under investigation as the information is confidential."
measures to ensure safe evacuation of persons using mobility aids during train breakdowns,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Transport in situations of train breakdowns and the potential necessity for passengers to evacuate via the rail tracks, what measures are in place to ensure the safety of persons who are dependent on mobility aids such as wheelchairs during evacuations.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: During a detrainment, the rail operator will deploy staff to assist commuters to evacuate safely to the nearest station, focusing on those with special mobility needs. SCDF personnel will also be on site, and stretchers will be used to evacuate wheelchair users as the maintenance walkway beside the running tracks is not wide enough to accommodate wheelchairs.The operators conduct regular detrainment exercises with LTA and SCDF, and these exercises include detraining commuters in wheelchairs. The most recent exercise was held in December 2016."
number of officers hired for enforcement action against errant cyclists or users of personal mobility devices,Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for Transport how many enforcement officers will be engaged to conduct enforcement action against errant cyclists or users of personal mobility devices who breach the rules on speeding on footpaths.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Currently, 16 Active Mobility Enforcement Officers from the Land Transport Authority (LTA), supported by more than 600 volunteers under the Active Mobility Patrol scheme, are involved in enforcement against errant cyclists and users of personal mobility devices. LTA is also looking at using other methods such as CCTV cameras to deter offenders."
issues surfaced through suara musyawarah exercise,Mr Azmoon Ahmad asked the Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (a) what is the current status of the Suara Musyawarah exercise since its initiation; (b) what are the key issues highlighted by the Malay community that have been addressed; and (c) whether there are any key issues pending action.,"Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim: The Suara Musyawarah Committee was formed in 2012 to engage the community to listen to their aspirations and concerns. The report emphasised the ""can-do"" spirit of the community and provided a number of noteworthy recommendations, especially those pertaining to education, youth, family and service delivery. We have been working on these recommendations progressively over the last few years.Education was a key topic of the Suara Musyawarah exercise, and we have further strengthened our educational support for the community at all levels. A key recommendation of MENDAKI's 2014 education review was for MENDAKI to provide greater focus on supporting our children's learning from a younger age, in pre-school. In this regard, MENDAKI has developed and launched a Resource Depository to help parents navigate national resources on early childhood and learning. MENDAKI is also partnering the Early Childhood Development Agency to better support low-income and vulnerable families on KidSTART, so as to enable their young children to have a good start in life. KidSTART is a pilot programme that aims to build a strong ecosystem of support for the child's well-being, development, and school-readiness. MENDAKI will continue to look at ways to strengthen its outreach and support for parents and children in the pre-school years.For older children and youths, MENDAKI has been regularly enhancing its flagship MENDAKI Tuition Programme (MTS), reaching out to more than 9,000 students annually, including strengthening tutor training and incorporating mentoring elements. MENDAKI also launched its 'Raikan Ilmu' or 'Celebrate Knowledge' campaign in June 2016 to promote a culture of learning, and this will be a regular event going forward. MENDAKI also established a Future Ready Unit to promote SkillsFuture to the community and to encourage, facilitate and position Malay workers well for the new economy.We also continue to develop our youth. This year, because of the hard work and talent of our students, we had a record number of MENDAKI Award recipients, and we want to provide platforms and opportunities to develop the potential of these outstanding youth. I had earlier mentioned that one of these platforms would be enhancing the MENDAKI Leadership Incubator to include a mentoring scheme that we would start next year. Also, MUIS, through the Rahmatan Lil Alamin Foundation provides support for youth to give back, by taking on local and overseas projects for service learning and to spread goodwill to those in need.MUIS is also continuing its efforts to increase the reach of Islamic Education (IE) for the young. As of 2015, the participation of those in structured Islamic Education classes has increased to about 50% of Muslim youths aged 7 to 16. This is done by enhancing access to IE through initiatives, such as the introduction of Kids aLIVE Home Edition, which supports parents in conducting IE lessons for their children at home. MUIS will continue working with mosques and other partners in differentiating its Islamic education programmes to cater to different life-stages of the young.On families and service delivery, MENDAKI complements national schemes such as Comcare subsidies, Workfare and Community Health Assistance Scheme that support all families, by offering various programmes and services to equip low-income families with skills like financial literacy. MENDAKI helps these families through Education Trust Fund subsidies and organises the Family Excellence Circles for families to support each other. One key follow-up of the Suara Musyawarah report was the setting up of MENDAKI@Heartlands satellite centres to bring programmes and services closer to the community. To implement this, MENDAKI has partnered MUIS and six mosques and have since attained an expanded outreach of about 19,000 individuals island-wide.MUIS has also increased the amount of financial assistance to the needy. Between 2014 and 2015, MUIS disbursed $2 million more to zakat beneficiaries. During Ramadan alone in 2016, MUIS disbursed $1.94 million to more than 12,900 beneficiaries, including those in welfare homes and institutions.The Report also touched on strengthening the Community Leaders Forum (CLF). The CLF secretariat continues to support capacity building for the Malay/Muslim Organisations (MMOs) in areas such as staff training, governance and review consultancy. In 2016, 11 MMOs participated in a WSQ Leadership and People Management Training Programme to strengthen leadership and management.The Suara Musyawarah conversation is not the end state. We will continue to engage our stakeholders and youth for new ideas and new ways of doing things, and work in close partnership with Government agencies to take the Malay/Muslim community forward."
impact of low water levels at johore river dams on singapore-malaysia water agreement obligations,"Mr Seah Kian Peng asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether the recent low water levels in Johore River dams, in particular that of Linggui Reservoir, will affect the ability of both parties in the water agreements from meeting their respective obligations","Dr Vivian Balakrishnan: The 1962 Water Agreement grants to PUB a right to abstract 250 million gallons per day (mgd) from the Johor River. It was guaranteed by both the Governments of Malaysia and Singapore under the 1965 Separation Agreement, which was deposited with the United Nations. The 1962 Water Agreement is sacrosanct to Singapore.Under the 1962 Water Agreement, PUB has ""the full and exclusive right and liberty to draw off take impound and use the water from the Johore River up to a maximum of 250 million gallons per day"". In return, Johor is entitled to a daily supply of treated water from Singapore ""not exceeding at any time two per cent of the total quantity of water supplied to Singapore from twelve midnight of any one day to twelve midnight of the following day"". In other words, Johor is entitled to buy up to about 5 mgd of treated water provided that Singapore is first able to abstract its entitlement of 250 mgd of water from the Johor River, and to subsequently import about 245 mgd of treated water in any given day. However, out of goodwill and without prejudice to our rights under the 1962 Water Agreement, Singapore has in practice supplied Johor with treated water in excess of Johor’s entitlement, even on occasions when PUB is unable to abstract its 250 mgd entitlement, for example during dry weather. Singapore has in fact been regularly supplying Johor with 16 mgd of treated water. In addition, we have supplied a further 5 to 6 mgd of treated water on a case-by-case basis at Johor's request during dry weather (for example in June and July 2016), as well as when Johor's water treatment plants are partially shut down for their monthly operational maintenance.We are concerned with the current situation at the Johor River. Linggiu Reservoir regulates the flow of the river, discharging water into the river to supplement the natural flow and to help contain salinity intrusions into the river from the sea.In August 2016, the Johor River Barrage became operational. This has helped to keep out salinity intrusions. However, even with the Johor River Barrage, the Johor River is unable to sustain both PUB’s entitlement of 250 mgd, as well as the current abstractions by Johor's Semangar and Loji Air Water Treatment Plants, which are upstream of PUB's waterworks.In order to support the current rate of abstraction, PUB has been discharging more water from Linggiu Reservoir. As a result, the water level in Linggiu Reservoir has dropped drastically over the past few years, from 84% at the start of 2015, to 49% at the start of 2016, to the lowest recorded level of 20% in October 2016. It stands at 27% as of 1 January 2017. There is a significant risk that Linggiu Reservoir may fail (ie, drop to 0%) in 2017 if it turns out to be a dry year. Should Linggiu Reservoir fail, there will be many more occasions when it will not be possible for PUB to abstract its entitlement of 250 mgd, and the current abstractions by Johor’s Semangar and Loji Air Water Treatment Plants will also be affected. This will cause severe problems for both Malaysia and Singapore.Given the importance of Linggiu Reservoir to Singapore's overall water supply, the Singapore Government is watching the situation closely, and has raised the matter with the Malaysian Government, most recently during the Malaysia-Singapore Leaders' Retreat on 13 December 2016. The Prime Ministers agreed on the importance of ensuring reliable and adequate water supply from the Johor River. The Malaysian Government reaffirmed its commitment to uphold Singapore's rights under the 1962 Water Agreement. Malaysia has informed us that it plans to implement schemes to increase the yield of the Johor River, and ensure that Singapore can reliably abstract our entitlement under the 1962 Water Agreement even during periods of dry weather.Singapore will cooperate with Malaysia to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome. The senior officials of our water ministries will discuss and identify possible solutions. Our agencies have an excellent working relationship, and will continue to work closely together to sustain our water supply."
action against illegal gambling dens,"Ms Chia Yong Yong asked the Minister for Home Affairs what action will the Government take against (i) illegal gambling dens, many of which operate openly in the back lanes of the lorongs in Geylang (ii) illegal medicine peddlars in Geylang (iii) illegal pasting of advertisements on lamp posts and other public properties in Geylang and (iv) illegal sale of cigarettes, most of which operate openly without fear or regard for the law.","Mr K Shanmugam: Over the past three years, serious crimes reported at Geylang, such as robbery and snatch theft, have fallen by more than 42%, from 134 in 2013 to 77 in 2016. Public order-related cases such as affray and serious hurt have also fallen by 27%, from 51 in 2013 to 37 in 2016. Nonetheless, more can be done to address the other offences and social disamenities at Geylang.The various offences reported at Geylang, such as those raised by Ms Chia Yong Yong, come under the purview of multiple agencies beyond the Ministry of Home Affairs. However, to enhance enforcement effectiveness, the various agencies co-ordinate their actions closely. This co-ordinated approach is underpinned bya. Information-sharing;b. Leveraging technology; andc. Optimising enforcement resources across agencies.Let me touch on these aspects in turn, and explain how they have enabled us to deal more effectively with the specific issues raised by Ms Chia.First, information-sharing between agencies. An inter-agency operations centre (IAOC) led by Police, has been established at the Geylang Neighbourhood Police Centre since May 2016. The IAOC allows multiple agencies to plan and execute enforcement operations in a coordinated manner. Take the example of the sale of duty-unpaid cigarettes, an issue which was raised by Ms Chia. The IAOC's CCTV camera feeds of Geylang allow Singapore Customs and Police to conduct surveillance, identify persons-of-interest, locate storage areas for duty-unpaid cigarettes, and mount joint-operations to apprehend illegal peddlers and seize the cigarettes.Second, our enforcement agencies are deploying more technology to enhance their effectiveness at Geylang. The Police have installed more Police cameras and improved the lighting at the Geylang lorongs. A total of 171 cameras have been installed at Geylang since 2015. This is a fourfold increase from the 47 cameras in 2014. The increased street lighting and wider network of cameras enhance the deterrence and detection of illicit activities at back alleys and side lanes, including those mentioned by Ms Chia such as the peddling of duty-unpaid cigarettes and illegal gambling.Third, to optimise the limited enforcement resources available, the various law enforcement agencies have pooled and re-organised existing auxiliary police officers into multi-skilled enforcement teams. Unlike single-agency teams which have a limited scope of enforcement, these multi-skilled teams allow officers to take action against multiple offences during each enforcement round, therefore delivering a greater impact on safety and security at Geylang with the same amount of resources. Since April 2016, the multi-skilled teams have performed high-visibility patrols at Geylang and enforced against a range of regulatory offences, including the supply of medicinal and health products without a valid licence, another area of concern raised by Ms Chia.On Ms Chia's feedback about the illegal pasting of advertisements on lamp posts and other public properties, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) enforces against such activities. Anti-stick paint is applied on lamp-posts and other street infrastructures to make it more difficult for advertisements to be pasted on them. Advertisement boards are also installed at areas with high pedestrian traffic to allow advertisers to publicise their goods and services.Our law enforcement agencies are committed to improving safety and security at Geylang, while retaining the vibrancy of the neighbourhood. We will continue to work with local community leaders and other agencies to maintain law and order in the area."
sustaining youths' interest in sports after olympics,"Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) whether there are plans by the Ministry to keep up the interest among Singaporean youths to take up sports in the aftermath of our success in the Olympic Games; and (b) whether more sporting events will be organised to ride on the prevailing enthusiasm especially among school children.","Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: The Olympics and Paralympics in Rio last year were watershed events for Singapore sports. We won our first ever Olympic Gold Medal and added two Gold and one Bronze medals at the Paralympics a month later. Singaporeans from all walks of life celebrated the hard work, determination and achievements of our Team Singapore athletes, who have inspired all of us not only to pursue sports with passion, but to strive to achieve our goals.The Government has put in place a comprehensive framework to develop young sporting talents, from building a broad base of active youths, to strengthening our talent development pipelines that will nurture young aspiring athletes.To encourage Singaporeans to adopt an active lifestyle, we launched ActiveSG in 2014. It has since garnered 1.2 million members, of whom almost 200,000 are between 7-18 years old. ActiveSG launched the Football, Basketball and Tennis Academies, as well as the Athletics Club last year, to provide affordable and structured programmes for youths to do sports beyond PE and CCAs. About 6,000 youths have benefited from these programmes. Another 150,000 from more than 300 schools have participated in the ongoing Sports Education Programme and School Holiday Sports Programmes each year. Through these programmes, we aim to build a stronger base from which talents could be scouted.Last year, SportSG also organised the inaugural GetActive! Singapore. This inaugural national week of sports saw more than half a million Singaporeans participating, including 40,000 students from over 70 schools. GetActive! Singapore also incorporated the third edition of the Singapore National Games, which saw more than 10,000 participants competing across 21 sports. The National Games complements existing competitions organised by the National Sports Associations, both adding to a stronger pipeline of sporting talents.For the young aspiring athletes, we have pathways for them through the Singapore Sports Institute, Singapore Sports School and National Youth Sports Institute, as part of our comprehensive High Performance Sports System to build a strong core of national athletes.The Singapore Sports Institute provides comprehensive support to athletes of varying potential and development needs, through financial grants, training and coaching, sports medicine to personal development. Athletes assessed to have the potential to excel at the highest level are supported on spexScholarships which allow them to focus on training fulltime to develop to their fullest potential.The Singapore Sports School allows young athletes to combine quality education with an excellent sports programme. The National Youth Sports Institute (NYSI) was launched in 2016 to provide support to youth athletes from both the mainstream schools as well as the Sports School. The NYSI works closely with partners to enhance the youth sports eco-system in the areas of talent identification and development, youth coaching, sports science and athlete life management.The work of the Singapore Sports Institute, Sports School and NYSI complements the important role played by our National Sports Associations and sports clubs in developing interest and grooming competitive athletes in their respective sports. Going forward, MCCY will continue to work with partners and stakeholders to enhance our High Performance Sports System."
reason for singapore's drop in world talent report 2016 ranking,Ms Tin Pei Ling asked the Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (a) what are the reasons for Singapore's drop in ranking in the latest world-talent ranking in IMD's World Talent Report 2016; (b) whether spending on home-grown talents has declined and whether this has adversely impacted the quality and size our talent pool; and (c) what is being done to further groom and boost the local talent pool.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: The IMD World Talent Report rankings take into account three factors. First, 'Readiness' – the availability of skills and competencies in the labour force to maintain the competitiveness of the economy. Second, 'Appeal' – the economy’s ability to attract top global talent. Third, 'Investment and Development' – the level of investment in and development of its local labour force, measured in terms of percentage of GDP spent on education and training.The most important of the three factors to us will be ""Readiness"" because it directly affects employability and employment of our workforce. Our ranking on 'Readiness' rose from 6th in 2014 to 2nd in 2015 to 1st in 2016, amongst 61 economies listed in the same report.On 'Appeal', we maintained our ranking, from 19th in 2014 to 18th in 2015 and back to 19th in 2016.However, on 'Investment and Development', our ranking dropped from 31st in 2014 to 38th in 2016 (we were ranked 29th in 2015). This is the main reason why Singapore's overall ranking went down from 10th last year to 15th this year.If you examine the reasons behind the fall in ranking of this category, a key reason is because percentage GDP spent on education dropped from 3.08% in 2013 to 2.99% in 2014. Notwithstanding this, I want to assure the Member that there is much more behind that broad percentage of GDP figure. Over the last decade, government overall expenditure on education has increased by around 75%, expenditure per student has more than doubled, and the pupil-teacher ratio for both primary and secondary education has improved.But as a percentage of GDP education expenditure has fallen, because while the denominator – GDP and working population – is still growing, the numerator – cohort sizes and student population – are falling.We pay attention to such rankings as they are credible, robust and helpful in giving a sense in how Singapore is performing vis-a-vis other economies. But at the same time we need to understand our unique conditions and that these are just good references. We will continue to improve our education system, uncover passions and interests, and promote lifelong learning through the SkillsFuture programme."
challenges in ramping up hdb flats supply,"Mr Chong Kee Hiong asked the Minister for National Development whether more resources can be allocated to expedite the construction of HDB flats for young couples and what are the challenges, if any, HDB faces in ramping up new flats' supply.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Helping young couples own their first home is one of our key priorities. The ramp-up of Built-To-Order (BTO) flat supply between 2011 and 2014 has helped to clear the first-timer demand backlog. Most first-timers are now able to select a flat within their first or second application, and definitely on their third try. We will monitor the market closely and calibrate our flat supply to be responsive to the housing needs of Singaporeans.To shorten waiting time for flat buyers further, HDB has since 2011 been calling tender for many projects as soon as designs are ready, instead of the previous practice of doing so only after 70% of flats have been booked. Hence, waiting time today is mainly down to construction time. In this regard, HDB has also adopted various productivity measures in the design and construction phases, such as the use of precast technology, to expedite construction.In terms of challenges in ramping up new flat supply, immediate sites availability is one, as time is often needed to ensure that existing encumbrances and uses on the sites are cleared. There is also a need to ensure that there will be sufficient infrastructure capacity, such as transport, sewerage and drainage, to support the new housing developments.Nonetheless, we recognise that some young couples want a new home as quickly as possible. HDB is studying how we can advance the construction work of some BTO projects and build them ahead of their sales launches. While it is not feasible to do so for the entire flat supply due to land constraints and risk of over-supply, we can potentially do this for some projects every year. This will provide some flats with shorter waiting to cater to couples who need a new BTO flat more urgently."
improvements after signalling system upgrade at north-south and east-west mrt lines,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Transport following the upgrade of the signalling system at the North-South and East-West MRT lines (a) what improvements have been observed; (b) what is the average interval between train arrivals during peak hours; and (c) what maintenance protocols are in place to ensure that the signalling system on the newer lines are always in optimal working condition.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The upgrade of the signalling system for the North-South Line will be completed by March this year, and that for the East-West Line by 2018. When the upgrade is completed, we will be able to run the trains closer together: one train every 100 seconds, compared to 120 seconds today. We will run the trains at this improved frequency during peak hours, effectively increasing the capacity of the two lines by 20 percent. Commuters can benefit from shorter waits and more comfortable rides.Changing the signalling system is however a complex undertaking and we have been advised by other MRT operators, including the London Underground, to expect significant teething problems in the process. Thus, I had asked the Land Transport Authority and the operator SMRT to conduct much more extensive testing before switching to the new signalling system. Still, the experience elsewhere suggests that testing may not completely anticipate and eliminate the technical glitches that come when the system is fully loaded. We thus seek commuters' understanding and patience.Thales, the signalling equipment manufacturer, is training SMRT staff on the operation and maintenance of the new system. They will also provide technical support in the initial years to resolve any teething issues."
drawing on past reserves for singapore-malaysia high-speed rail project,"Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for Finance (a) whether the Government has sought the President's permission to draw down on past reserves in order to proceed with the High Speed Rail project with Malaysia; and (b) if so, how much of our past reserves has been set aside for this purpose.","Mr Lawrence Wong: The Government did not ask the President for permission to draw on Past Reserves for the High Speed Rail (HSR) project. The project will be funded following normal budgetary processes in due course.Under the terms of the HSR Agreement with Malaysia, the Government will guarantee payments by Singapore's HSR Infrastructure Company (InfraCo) to meet specific obligations, such as the Availability Payments by the InfraCo to the Assets Company (AssetsCo) to cover the latter's capital expenditure and costs of operation, maintenance and renewal of rail assets. In accordance with Article 144 of the Constitution and Section 15 of the Financial Procedure Act, the Government sought and obtained the President’s concurrence to give this guarantee to the InfraCo.Malaysia has also provided a similar guarantee for its InfraCo's obligations. This reaffirms the commitment of both Governments to the HSR project, and gives added confidence to interested investor."
maternity claims for mothers whose companies close down during maternity leave period,Mr Darryl David asked the Minister for Social and Family Development what options are available to new mothers whose companies close down while they are still on maternity leave in terms of being able to claim their full maternity leave benefits.,"Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: Employers are obliged to pay maternity benefits to employees retrenched while on maternity leave, even if they close down. This is provided for under the Employment Act (EA) and the Child Development Co-savings Act (CDCA). Employees who are not paid accordingly may approach MOM or MSF for advice and assistance. MOM will investigate accordingly and take appropriate action, including through the Labour Court."
energy usage trends and future energy conservation plans,Mr Azmoon Ahmad asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what has been our energy usage in the last ten years and what is the forecast for the next ten years; (b) whether our future energy needs can be met and what is the plan to meet this demand; (c) whether our green environment initiative has bore results on energy usage and what more can be done; and (d) whether the Ministry will consider (i) turning off some street lamps on expressways and major roads after midnight till 5am to save energy and (ii) incentives for private residences to install solar panels.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Our annual energy demand grew from 38,300 GWh in 2005 to 50,300 GWh in 2015, representing a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.8%. Over the next decade, energy demand is expected to grow at a slower rate, with a projected CAGR of about 1.2 – 1.8%. This is due to factors such as lower projected growth rates for GDP and population.Singapore has adopted a liberalised market environment which encourages efficiency and competition. We do not subsidise energy, and rely on price signals from the wholesale electricity market. Based on current projections, there is sufficient supply to meet electricity demand for the next 10 years. Nonetheless, the Government has taken steps to improve our energy security, competitiveness, and sustainability. For example, we built the liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal to diversify our energy sources, and we are pushing for greater adoption of solar energy.The Member has also asked whether our green initiatives have helped to reduce our energy consumption. Yes, it has. Let me give a few examples.The industrial sector is the largest energy user in Singapore, accounting for 67% of total energy consumption in 2014. The Government uses both incentives and regulations to improve energy efficiency amongst companies. So far, 60 projects have been approved under the Grant for Energy Efficiency Technologies (GREET) scheme – these projects are expected to yield energy savings of S$726 million. We also introduced the Energy Conservation Act in 2012 requiring energy-intensive facilities to put in place energy management practices.Another energy-intensive sector is the building sector. Since 2005, the Government has been driving the adoption of energy efficient design and solutions towards more environmentally sustainable buildings. To date, there are more than 2,800 green building projects in Singapore translating to about one-third of the total building stock. Our target is to have 80% of all buildings green by 2030. The Government will also lead by example to attain relevant Green Mark ratings for all large and mid-sized public sector buildings by FY2020.For households, since the introduction of the Mandatory Energy Labelling Scheme (MELS) and the Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) in 2008 and 2011 respectively, we have seen improvements in the energy efficiency of household appliances that contribute to a significant share of the household electricity bill such as air-conditioners and refrigerators. These efficiency improvements will translate to annual energy savings of more than $100 million for households. Going forward, we will be including more appliances under these initiatives.The Member has also asked about street lighting. Singapore follows international guidelines for street lighting. For the safety of all road users, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) will not be switching off street lights on our roads between midnight and 5am. However, LTA will be switching to Light Emitting Diode (LED) street lights, which consume 25% less energy than regular street lights.Notwithstanding this, there is clearly room for us to do more. Singapore is an alternative energy disadvantaged country. That is why improving our energy efficiency is a key strategy to achieving our pledge at the Paris Agreement. We will continue to improve our policies as well as test new technologies such as smart homes, smart grids, zero-energy buildings and electric vehicles. Although we do not provide incentives or subsidies for energy, we have introduced regulatory enhancements to facilitate the entry of renewable energy, such as solar energy, across all sectors including private residences. Lastly, we are working to further increase public awareness and participation in conserving energy."
issues highlighted from our singapore conversation exercise,Mr Azmoon Ahmad asked the Prime Minister (a) what is the current status of the Singapore Conversation exercise since its initiation; (b) what are the key highlighted issues that have been have been addressed; and (c) whether there are any key issues that are still pending action.,"Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien (for the Prime Minister): Close to 50,000 Singaporeans from all walks of life participated in over 600 dialogue sessions as part of Our Singapore Conversation (OSC) in 2012. It was a rich dialogue among Singaporeans, and not just between Government and Singaporeans, aimed at defining our shared future together.This national engagement helped crystallise the core aspirations of Singaporeans. First, opportunities to lead fulfilling lives, to realise one's potential. Second, coming together to build a better Singapore. Third, assurance that our basic needs can be met, that we do not have to face life's uncertainties alone. Fourth, closer community ties, a cohesive society and a warmer kampong spirit. Finally, trust between the Government and people, and trust among Singaporeans.These aspirations have served to shape our policy directions. For example, in the past few years we made significant moves to keep housing affordable, introduced the Pioneer Generation Package, MediShield Life, reviewed our PSLE system and introduced Skills Future.Another important outcome from OSC has been in how we see the importance of on-going public engagement. OSC helped us learn more about how we can better communicate and engage with Singaporeans, and also the importance of creating space for the community to take ownership in shaping our shared future.Building on the momentum of Our Singapore Conversation as well as the many ground-up efforts to celebrate SG50, we launched the SGfuture engagement series in November last year – as a platform to encourage more Singaporeans to go a step further by taking action to realise their aspirations and ideas for the future.We launched Our Singapore Fund in August to partner and support more Singaporeans who wish to embark on ground-up initiatives that will bring people together as a community and help build the Singaporean identity. We are also launching Singapore Cares as a national movement to rally Singaporeans to strengthen the kampong spirit and help others in need.The way we work as a Government is changing. We will continue to find different ways to understand citizen needs and to partner them. SGfuture was a step in our ongoing journey to make it possible for every Singaporean to co-create our future together as we journey towards SG100."
evidence that section 309 of penal code deters attempted suicides,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is the evidence available to the Government that suggests that section 309 of the Penal Code deters attempted suicides; and (b) what efforts will the Government be undertaking to ensure that this law does not deter those who entertain suicidal thoughts from seeking help.,"Mr K Shanmugam: I had addressed the issue of attempted suicide in an earlier reply. It has been a criminal offence to attempt suicide, because it was thought to be important that society should make it clear that people should not take their own lives. Based on the World Health Organisation’s statistics, Singapore's suicide rate is lower than a number of other developed countries.In practice, prosecutions are rare, and Police officers are trained to respond to cases of attempted suicide with sensitivity and compassion. When responding to such cases, Police’s priority is to ensure the person’s safety.The Ministry of Health has also shared in an earlier reply how Singapore adopts a multi-pronged approach to prevent suicide. Government agencies and social sector organisations work together to try and prevent suicides through upstream prevention, encouraging people to seek help, providing support to at-risk groups and offering crisis support.This multi-pronged approach includes programmes to reduce the stigma in seeking help for suicidal thoughts. Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs) such as the Samaritans of Singapore (SOS), have been actively promoting public awareness on suicide prevention. They have rendered advice and help to persons with suicidal thoughts who call their hotlines. Silver Ribbon (Singapore) also addresses the stigma associated with mental illness, reaches out to those who need help, and encourages them to seek early treatment. The Institute of Mental Health (IMH) also conducts public education programmes in schools and in the community, to increase understanding of mental health conditions."
encouraging building owners and developers to adopt solar energy technology,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for National Development (a) what plans are there to encourage more building owners and property developers to adopt solar energy technology; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider introducing incentives for private landed home owners to install solar panels at their properties to save on energy consumption.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Solar energy is a promising renewable energy option for Singapore. We plan to increase our solar generation capacity from 114 Mega-Watt-peak (MWp) today to 350 MWp by 2020. This will represent about 5% of our projected peak electricity demand in 2020.The Government is encouraging the adoption of solar energy technology in several ways. First, we are aggregating demand across Government agencies through the SolarNova programme. Aggregating demand leads to greater economies of scale and reduced costs. So far, around 55 MWp of solar panels have been installed on about 1,000 HDB blocks. The intention is to eventually deploy solar panels on 5,500 HDB blocks and 100 Government buildings by 2020.Second, BCA's Green Mark Scheme encourages the adoption of renewable energy, including solar power. Green Mark accreditation points are awarded to buildings for incorporating sustainable design features like the installation of solar panels. To date, over one hundred Green Mark developments have committed to installing solar panels. Together, they will contribute about 20 MWp to our solar generation capacity.For private landed home owners, they are free to install solar panels on their own properties. The Energy Market Authority (EMA) and Singapore Power have provided information to guide home owners on how they can go about doing this. In addition, they can offset their electricity bills by selling any excess solar-generated power back to the power grid.The Government will continue to study ways to encourage more solar power adoption, including continued investment in R&D, policy enhancements, and increased engagement with potential users."
measures to protect consumers who buy from parallel car importers,"Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) in view of repeated incidents of parallel car importers who fail to deliver the car orders, what measures are there to enhance protection for consumers and tighten the criteria for companies which register themselves as parallel importers.","Mr S Iswaran: The Government's approach to consumer protection is based on promoting fair trading among retailers, and helping consumers make informed purchasing decisions. Motor vehicle dealers, including parallel importers, do not require a licence to operate.The majority of motor vehicle dealers engage in fair trading practices. Over the period of 2013 to 2015, the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) received an annual average of about 120 consumer feedback on car dealers failing to honour contracts. This is less than 1% of the average annual motor vehicle transactions over the same period.It is a common business practice for motor vehicle dealers to collect prepayment for motor vehicle purchases. This is not considered an unfair trading practice. Consumers can protect their prepayments by making informed purchasing decisions such as reading reviews on the dealer, finding out if the dealer is on the CASE's alert list, and transacting with dealers which participate in the CaseTrust Accreditation Scheme as they are required maintain a performance bond to protect consumers' fees and deposits. Car dealers who are members of the Singapore Vehicle Traders Association (SVTA) may leverage on the association's Local Enterprise and Association Development (LEAD) programme with SPRING Singapore to reduce the cost of signing up for CaseTrust accreditation.Motor vehicle dealers who indulge in unfair practices will be investigated by SPRING Singapore, the administering agency for the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act. Egregious cases that involve criminal activities will be surfaced to the Police for investigation."
pilot public-private partnership to send emergency cases transported by scdf ambulances to raffles hospital,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked the Minister for Health what are the outcomes of the pilot public-private partnership between SCDF and Raffles Hospital whereby emergency cases transported by SCDF ambulances are sent to the emergency department at Raffles Hospital on weekdays between 9 am and 5 pm.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The collaboration between the Ministry of Health and Raffles Hospital in emergency care started in June 2015. The objective is to improve access to emergency medical care in Singapore by tapping on available capacity in the private sector. Under the collaboration, SCDF ambulances send patients with non-life threatening conditions to Raffles Hospital for emergency medical treatment.To support care continuity for patients, doctors at Raffles Hospital are given authorized access to the patients’ medical records and discharge summaries in the National Electronic Health Records. MOH provides government subsidies to patients under the collaboration for their medical treatment at Raffles Hospital, similar to how they would receive means-tested subsidised services at public hospitals.The collaboration with Raffles Hospital has served more than 3,500 patients so far, with comparable health outcomes to patients who went to public hospitals. More than 90% of patients surveyed have indicated that the arrangement has met or exceeded their expectations. The collaboration benefits other patients too, as it increases our overall capacity for emergency medical care in Singapore. It has also reduced the travel time and turnaround time for SCDF ambulances.MOH is open to partnerships with private sector healthcare providers, whether in hospital services, primary care or intermediate and long-term care. In deciding future extensions or expansions of such collaborations, we will continue to focus on achieving good outcomes for patients in terms of care quality and affordability."
number and causes of environment-related workplace injuries,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the number of workers affected by environment-related injuries over the last two years; (b) what is the number of workplace accidents caused by the lack of protective equipment being used during harsh weather conditions; and (c) what are some of the safety measures put in place when harsh environmental conditions set in especially for workers exposed to the weather elements.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: Nine workers were affected by environment-related injuries over the last two years and none of these injuries were due to the lack of personal protective equipment, or PPE in short, being used during harsh weather conditions.The WSH Council has developed clear guidelines for employers and workers to adopt, when harsh environmental or weather conditions are involved. These can be found in the Guidelines on Managing Heat Stress, and Haze Guidelines and Advisory for Work. For example, employers should first assess if outdoor work is necessary, and develop a plan for working safely during harsh environmental conditions. When outdoor work cannot be avoided, raincoat and safety boots have to be provided during rainy weather and N95 masks whenever the air quality reaches the unhealthy levels. To mitigate the risk of heat stress, employers should provide short regular rest periods in between work and allow workers to rest in cool shaded rest areas with drinking water points.We will continue to work with workers, employers and unions to increase awareness of environment-related risks and the needed safety measures. Anyone who assessed that workers’ safety and health are put at risk because of exposure to harsh environmental conditions can report these situations to MOM. We will investigate and establish if the safety measures are adequate. With proper risk assessment and preventive measures in place, we can provide a safe and healthy work environment for our workers."
upcoming home improvement programme plans for hdb flats in nee soon,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for National Development (a) what are the upcoming plans for HDB's Home Improvement Programme in Nee Soon GRC; and (b) whether the programme will include the sealing-off of air-conditioner ducts as the plywood rots after some years.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The Home Improvement Programme (HIP) was introduced in 2007 with about 300,000 eligible flats. To date, HIP has been announced for about 220,000 flats. For Nee Soon GRC, there remain about 8,000 HIP-eligible flats. HDB expects to complete the selection of the remaining HIP-eligible flats by FY2018. The next nomination exercise to select blocks to undergo HIP is scheduled to take place in early FY2017.With regard to the air-conditioner ducts, these are timber panels provided in older HDB blocks to facilitate installation of air-conditioners. There are currently no plans to include the repair of these panels under the HIP's scope of works. As these fall under common property, residents can approach the respective Town Councils for help in replacing decayed panels, or make their own arrangements to seal up these panels."
setting minimum age limit for drivers of private hire vehicles,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry will consider having a minimum age of 27 years for drivers of private hire vehicles based on accident-age risk assessment of drivers.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Our view is that requiring private hire car drivers to have a minimum driving experience of two years should be adequate to reasonably ensure passenger safety. There is no need to also discriminate on the basis of age. In fact, where safety is concerned, the number of years of driving experience may be more important than age. An older person who has just gotten his driving licence might be less confident behind the wheels, compared to a younger person, say 25 years old, who has been driving for a few years."
impact on singapore-china relations due to singapore's official stand on trans-pacific partnership and initiative on south china sea,Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs what is the Government's assessment of the current state of bilateral relations with China after Singapore's alleged initiative on South China Sea disputes at the Non-Aligned Movement Summit in Venezuela and given Singapore's official stand on the Trans-Pacific Partnership.,"Dr Vivian Balakrishnan: The Global Times, a Chinese tabloid, made a false allegation that Singapore tried to unilaterally insert South China Sea-related language into the Final Document of the Non-Aligned Movement Summit in Venezuela. Since our factual rebuttals of the false allegations are known publicly, I will not repeat them here.As Members know, Singapore has a long-standing and broad relationship with China. We celebrated 25 years of diplomatic relations, and upgraded our relationship into an ""All-Round Cooperative Partnership Progressing with the Times"" last year when President Xi Jinping made a State Visit. Singapore’s cooperation with China remains deep and multi-faceted. China is our top trading partner and we have been China’s top foreign investor since 2013.Singapore has also been a consistent advocate of a free and open international trade system. We were a founding member of the P4 which subsequently developed into the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). The TPP is intended to be an open and inclusive agreement. Singapore welcomes China to join the TPP when they are ready to do so, in the same way that we supported China’s accession to the World Trade Organisation.Singapore’s position as a non-claimant state in the South China Sea disputes has been articulated in this House on several occasions, including the Committee of Supply Debate in February this year. Prime Minister Lee also explained in considerable detail our position during this year’s National Day Rally. It will be useful for the Member and her party to state, for the record, whether they agree with the Government’s position. If not, what is their position?The Chinese leaders know Singapore’s position and also understand that our bilateral relations extend far beyond a single issue. Hence, when PM Lee was invited to attend the G20 Leaders’ Summit hosted by China and met President Xi in Hangzhou this September, the two leaders agreed to strengthen our mutually beneficial cooperation based on the principle of mutual respect and mutual understanding. The Chongqing Connectivity Initiative, our third Government-to-Government project, is also making good progress.People-to-people exchanges continue to be robust. Just recently, we hosted a Guangdong delegation under the Singapore Cooperation Programme to exchange views on developmental experience.On the Government’s part, we continue to support private-sector efforts through initiatives such as the proposed upgrade of the China-Singapore Free Trade Agreement."
analysis of entrepreneurial success and failures in singapore,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) whether the Ministry will consider compiling anonymised case studies of entrepreneurial successes and failures in Singapore, with an analysis drawing out the concrete success factors and mistakes respectively, to be published as an educational tool for entrepreneurs, would-be entrepreneurs and organizations that fund start-ups.","Mr S Iswaran: MTI and its agencies regularly profile successful entrepreneurs and companies through various platforms. This enables entrepreneurs to learn from the experiences of these examples in pursuing their business endeavours. The platforms include speeches given by political office holders, outreach events, advertorials and online channels such as the SME Portal managed by SPRING1. IE Singapore also profiles Singapore companies and their internationalisation experiences through its #SgGoesGlobal series on its website.As success factors and business challenges may differ across industries, the Government also works closely with the trade associations and chambers (TACs) to provide sector-specific information to help budding entrepreneurs distil learning points from the failures or mistakes of companies in the same sector. Such information is typically shared with the entrepreneurs and existing businesses through channels such as the TACs’ respective outreach events or publications. For example, in June 2016, the Restaurant Association of Singapore (RAS) published a guidebook, entitled ""Turning Passion Into Profits"", in collaboration with SPRING. The guidebook offers entrepreneurs tips and guidelines on how to set up and run food and beverage (F&B) businesses in Singapore. In addition to case studies, industry data is also available in the guidebook to help entrepreneurs in the F&B industry assess the viability of their own businesses and gain a realistic understanding of operating challenges such as financial and manpower resources.Targeted assistance and support is also readily available through Government-facilitated seminars, workshops, dialogue sessions and mentoring services. These include IE Singapore’s iAdvisory series of seminars and workshops that provide companies with insights into market opportunities or business capabilities, and in-market workshops held in foreign markets to help local entrepreneurs connect with like-minded partners and gain in-market overseas experience. SPRING also works closely with the Action Community for Entrepreneurship (ACE) to support the start-up community. Through dialogue sessions and one-on-one mentoring, would-be entrepreneurs can tap the expertise of more experienced entrepreneurs to accelerate their learning and acquire a deeper appreciation of the challenges and potential pitfalls of setting up their businesses."
students affected by gce 'o' level maths exam mix-up,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar asked the Minister for Education (Schools) what led to the mix-up of the GCE 'O' Level examination papers for Mathematics recently and how fairness and objectivity will be ensured in assessing the 70 affected students for their final Mathematics grade.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: In 2016, schools could offer different 'O' level Mathematics examination papers to Secondary 5 Normal (Academic) [N(A)] students due to a change in syllabus. However, the topics examined under the old and revised syllabi are largely comparable. While the Secondary 4 Express students are the first batch to take the examination under the revised syllabus, the old syllabus is still available for the Secondary 5N(A) students.On 20 October 2016, 73 Secondary 5N(A) candidates from two schools mistakenly sat for 'O' Level Mathematics Paper 1 under the new syllabus. This error was caused by their schools registering them using the wrong syllabus code. Upon discovering the error, the two schools and the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB) took immediate steps to ensure that the affected candidates would sit for the correct Paper 2 the following day. This was indeed the case the next day.Schools have processes in place to ensure the accuracy of the examination registration, and both affected schools acknowledged that such an error could have been avoided if checks in the registration processes were more thorough, especially in instances where two different syllabi were offered for the same subject. The two schools have reviewed their processes and tightened checks for future examination registration.SEAB is working with the two schools and the University of Cambridge International Examinations to ensure that the affected candidates will be fairly assessed in the GCE 'O' Level Mathematics Paper 1 examination. SEAB will take into consideration the circumstances of the incident and various other information, including the candidates’ performance in the school’s preliminary examination for Mathematics, their performance in the GCE 'O' Level Mathematics examination and the cohort's performance in the GCE 'O' Level Mathematics examination.This is a rare and unfortunate incident, and I assure Members that my colleagues are working very conscientiously not just to make sure it does not recur, but also to facilitate a fair assessment for each affected student in this case."
becoming an autonomous vehicle-ready nation,"Mr Azmoon Ahmad asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether Singapore is ready to be claimed as an autonomous vehicle ready nation; (b) if so, whether the regulations and legal framework have been established; and (c) how does the Ministry intend to deal with the recent accident involving an autonomous driving vehicle.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Self-driving technology gives us the opportunity to improve the public transport system in a significant way. For example, we can overcome manpower shortages with self-driving buses. We can also introduce new mobility concepts such as fleets of self-driving pods to enhance first-last mile travel. We are testing these and other concepts to better understand the technology and their potential for application in Singapore. Self-driving technology, however, is not yet mature enough for widespread public deployment. Most analysts believe that this day is about 10 to 15 years away. But over the next few years, we will see incremental deployment in limited circumstances and geographies.LTA has established a regulatory framework to facilitate trials of self-driving vehicles in Singapore. To trial on public roads, self-driving vehicles must demonstrate roadworthiness by passing an overall vehicle safety assessment. All trial participants must have in place insurance covering injury to persons, death and property damage.We are also studying the regulatory and legal frameworks we would need to have in place for the day when self-driving vehicles are deployed on our roads on an actual-use basis, and no longer for trials and pilots. The trials currently being conducted in one-north and other parts of Singapore will give us a better understanding of these issues. We are also sharing notes with overseas counterparts.LTA and the Traffic Police are investigating the accident involving nuTonomy’s self-driving car. In the meantime, nuTonomy has stopped its trials while it reviews the causes of the accident and how to improve the safety of its trials, and rectifies any technological shortcomings it may find."
crew of singapore-registered vessels encountering difficulties in south china sea,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Transport what practical steps and mechanisms does the Government have in place to help owners and crew of Singapore-registered civilian vessels avoid encountering difficulties when sailing over the disputed South China Sea.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The ""practical steps and mechanisms"" for passages by vessels are implemented within the framework of international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea or UNCLOS. Freedom of navigation, including navigation by Singapore-registered civilian vessels, is a fundamental element of that framework. This freedom of navigation enables vessels to ply their trade to different parts of the world, including through vital sea lines of communication in the South China Sea.More recently, ASEAN Member States and China have also reaffirmed their commitment to the freedom of navigation and overflight above the South China Sea in accordance with universally recognised principles of international law, including UNCLOS.To ensure a smooth voyage, all vessels must exercise due care. Vessels are required to carry nautical charts to plan its route and monitor its position throughout the voyage, exercising care to avoid navigational hazards.Ships owners should also ensure that their vessels are properly maintained and adequately manned by competent crew. To this end, the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore, or MPA, ensures that Singapore-registered vessels are seaworthy and crew on-board are duly certified.Singapore-registered vessels in situation of distress should contact MPA and the surrounding coastal states for assistance. To date MPA has not received any reports of interference from Singapore-registered vessels traversing the South China Sea."
link between entrepreneurship and degree of open competition,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) whether the Ministry will consider undertaking a study to determine the link between rates of entrepreneurship in specific industries and the degree of open competition in that industry as measured by the market share of the top companies.,"Mr S Iswaran: The Competition Commission of Singapore (CCS) administers and enforces the Competition Act which prohibits anti-competitive conduct. This would facilitate market access by entrepreneurs, and ensure a level playing field for all businesses. CCS takes action against anti-competitive agreements and exclusionary conduct by dominant players by removing anti-competitive restrictions that could hinder new businesses.While market share information can be used as an indicator for the level of competition and entrepreneurship in a market, CCS also takes into consideration other factors such as the degree of product differentiation, the responsiveness of buyers to price increases, and the price responsiveness of competitors. Besides regulatory aspects, industry-specific characteristics also cause significant variations. For example, the process from ideation to production could take a few years for deep technology sectors such as medical technology (MedTech) and clean technology (CleanTech) because of significant hardware development, larger capital investment, and deeper expertise."
incidence of pre-school centres allowing staff to start work before passing pre-employment medical screening,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) for the past three years, how many cases have there been of schools and childcare centres allowing potential teachers or staff to start work before they have passed the pre-employment medical screening; and (b) what actions have been taken against these schools and childcare centres.","Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: Under the Child Care Centres Act and Education Act, new child care, kindergarten and school staff members are required to obtain medical clearances before they commence work. The Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) requires childcare centres and kindergartens to register their staff members and declare on-line that this requirement has been adhered to. ECDA also conducts random checks to verify the declarations.Over the past three years, one childcare centre was found to have allowed their teacher to work before obtaining the pre-employment medical certification. ECDA issued a warning letter to the centre and put it on a short probationary licence. ECDA also stepped up supervision of the centre to ensure that it had put in place measures to avoid future lapses."
consumers pursuing complaints against merchant,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (a) for a complainant who wishes to pursue a complaint against a merchant, what kind of assistance from any consumer protection organisation is available and at what cost; and (b) has any complainant been refused assistance by such organisation and, if so, what is the breakdown of these reasons for the past five years.","Mr S Iswaran: The Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) is the first point of contact for consumers who have disputes with retailers. CASE advises consumers on their rights and the possible courses of action that they may choose to take. The consumer can pursue the issue on his own or enlist CASE’s assistance. Consumers who want CASE to assist them can choose from a range of measures such as negotiation and mediation. CASE has a set of fees for its services, which is tiered depending on the extent of services provided and the value of the claims. The list of fees is published online on CASE’s website.Over the past five years, CASE has helped to clarify an average of about 15,500 consumer enquiries per year. In addition, CASE has assisted or counselled an average of about 8,600 consumer cases per year. Of these cases, about 20% obtain letters from CASE which set out the consumer’s rights, the case-specific concerns and resolution sought. The consumers use the letters to engage the retailers. Consumers pay CASE an administrative fee of $10.70 for this letter.Consumers may also choose to have CASE negotiate with the retailer on their behalf. As CASE is constituted as an association, it is only able to represent its members when dealing with the retailer. Consumers who become individual CASE members pay an annual membership fee of $26.75. Depending on the value of the claim, the consumer also pays an administrative fee which is tiered based on the value of the claim - ranging from $10.70 for claims of less than $5,000 to $53.50 for claims of up to $20,000; with an additional $53.50 for every $10,000 or part thereof above $20,000.CASE has not rejected any requests from consumers for assistance, except where the requests are beyond the ambit of consumer protection laws. These include business-to-business disputes, application for accident claims and investment contracts."
investigations into 'penny stock' cases,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Prime Minister in light of the securities fraud investigations relating to the ""penny stock"" case which have been ongoing for several years (a) how robust are Singapore's safeguards against such cases of fraud; and (b) how does the Commercial Affairs Department compare to equivalent bodies in other developed countries in terms of the level of staffing and resources devoted to detecting and investigating securities fraud.","Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): Singapore has robust safeguards against attempts to manipulate or rig our capital markets. There are strict rules in place and our regulatory regime against market misconduct is comparable to those in other developed markets. But it is not possible to have safeguards that can prevent all misconduct, which is why we have an effective enforcement regime to ensure that any market misconduct is swiftly detected, thoroughly investigated, and firmly dealt with. In the most recent Financial Sector Assessment Report on Singapore, the International Monetary Fund rated our regime very favourably.The Singapore Exchange (SGX), MAS and CAD work closely together in investigating suspected fraud in our capital markets and taking enforcement actions. SGX is the frontline supervisor. It monitors trading activities and conducts preliminary assessments of possible market misconduct, using electronic surveillance systems. SGX recently enhanced its ""Trade With Caution"" alerts by providing investors more detailed information on unusual trading activities. Such alerts serve to disrupt at an early stage any efforts at market manipulation by those who may be responsible for the unusual trading activities.Besides referrals from SGX, MAS and CAD also receive market intelligence on suspected misconduct from interactions with financial institutions and market participants, suspicious transaction reports lodged with CAD, and public feedback.MAS and CAD conduct joint investigations on securities market misconduct such as insider trading and market manipulation. This close inter-agency cooperation leverages MAS’ expertise in financial markets and CAD’s experience in investigating financial crime. MAS and CAD are continually enhancing their enforcement capabilities to detect and investigate market abuse and misconduct, including the use of data analytics and digital forensics.MAS and CAD have also taken tough enforcement actions to deter securities fraud. Between 2011 and 2015, MAS took 21 civil penalty actions against market misconduct offences under the Securities and Futures Act. Over the same period, CAD prosecuted a total of 34 persons for false trading and other serious market misconduct.Given the complexity of most instances of securities market fraud, investigations take time. The amount of evidence that needs to be gathered and analysed.such as bank accounts and transactions, is typically large. If suspects and witnesses are not available or uncooperative, it adds to the length of investigations. These are challenges that cannot be directly addressed by merely increasing resources.The resources that Singapore has devoted to investigating market misconduct offences are commensurate with the market capitalisation and number of listed companies in our securities market, and comparable with other developed markets such as Hong Kong and Australia. More important than the numbers is the quality and type of resources we have to detect and investigate capital market crimes. The approach taken by CAD and MAS is to focus on having dedicated units equipped with specialised skillsets that look into securities fraud-related crimes, and to continually deepen expertise and capabilities."
issuance of newspaper street vendor licence,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) how many newspaper street vendors have been issued with licences in the past three years; (b) how does one qualify for the licence; and (c) whether there is a quota on the number of licences issued for any one location.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Street hawking was rife in the early days of Singapore’s development. The proliferation of street hawkers, however, posed a risk to public health as the street hawkers lacked proper equipment and amenities such as clean tap water. The lack of a proper waste management system also resulted in waste being thrown indiscriminately which in turn led to environmental pollution and the proliferation of vectors.To address these problems, most of the street hawkers were relocated into purpose-built hawker centres which were provided with essential amenities such as piped water supply, proper sewage connections and bulk bin centres for the disposal of waste. Some hawkers were, however, allowed to continue operating in the streets as their trades were not compatible with those in hawker centres but their activities were strictly enforced to ensure that their stall sites and their surroundings were kept clean at all times.In 1994, street hawkers were licensed in a one-time exercise to control their numbers and no more licences were issued after that. The intention was to phase out these street hawkers through natural attrition and allow such trades to move into proper premises. However, in the early 2000s, the street hawking scheme was reopened as a means to temporarily help those who are needy and less employable tide over their financial difficulties. Today, licensed street hawkers sell items such as newspapers, ice-cream, canned drinks, costume jewellery and phone cards. Out of the 179 licensed street hawkers who sell newspapers, five of them were issued their licences in the last 3 years.There are several criteria that applicants must comply with to obtain a street hawking licence. For example, applicants must be at least 45 years of age and be physically fit to conduct their business. Notwithstanding this, NEA will look at each application on a case-by-case basis. While there is no quota on the number of licences for any one location, licences can only be granted with the support of the relevant land agency or Town Council, which designates locations for street hawking activities so as to minimise disamenities to residents and unfair competition to businesses and other stakeholders in the vicinity.Ultimately, street hawking is not a permanent solution for anyone trying to make a living. Those experiencing financial hardship can be better assisted through the various help and job placement schemes available. There are also various Government-funded training programmes for those who wish to pick up new skills and seek more stable forms of employment."
scaling water conservation tax to allow for minimum hygiene standards,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether the Ministry will consider scaling the application of the water conservation tax (WCT) for households such that there is no WCT imposed on a quantity of household water consumption deemed necessary for minimum hygiene standards.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The total water price comprises the water tariff, used water charges and the Water Conservation Tax (WCT). Currently, both the water tariff and the WCT are tiered. While households that consume less than 40m3 of water pay a water tariff of $1.17/m3, and a WCT at 30% of the water tariff, households that consume more than 40m3 of water per month pay a higher tariff and a higher WCT, at 45% of tariff. The differentiated tariff and WCT serve to discourage excessive water consumption. Mr Perera’s suggestion would mean further differentiating WCT such that consumption within a certain volume below the first consumption tier will not attract the WCT.We have imposed WCT on overall water consumed because of the principle that water conservation should apply to all households from the first drop. Whether water is used for basic or discretionary purposes, there is a need to ensure prudence and avoid wastage. Hence, the WCT is levied as a percentage of water tariff to reinforce the message that water is precious from the very first drop.This is consistent with our water pricing principle and approach, which is to price water to reflect its Long Run Marginal Cost (LRMC). The WCT, together with the water tariff and used water charges, seek to price water such that it reflects the cost of producing the next drop of potable water, which is likely to be more from desalination and NEWater. This ensures that water demand, for whatever purposes, takes into account the scarcity value of water.Nonetheless, we appreciate Mr Perera’s intent in ensuring that water remains affordable for household needs. For this, the Government provides appropriate cash grants to all HDB households through the Utilities-Save (U-Save) scheme to help defray their utilities expenses.This approach allows Government to right-price water to encourage prudent use of water, while at the same time ensure affordability of utilities to lower income households."
training and help for teachers to cope with stress,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for Education (Schools) (a) what services or mechanisms are available to teachers to resolve disputes between parents and teachers; (b) how does the Ministry address work-related stress faced by teachers; and (c) what services are available to teachers that cater to their psychological well-being.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: Our schools seek to establish positive and mutually respectful partnerships with parents. In doing so, they are supported with resources such as a Parent Engagement Guide and teachers are also given training in parent engagement skills. In cases where teachers need help in engaging parents, they can seek advice and guidance from their school leaders. When needed, school leaders will engage the parents directly.With regard to work-related stress, measures have been put in place to support and guide schools in teacher work allocation. We also regularly review resources provided to schools, including manpower support, to ensure that schools are able to implement their programmes well while keeping the work assigned to teachers manageable. In addition, teachers are provided with protected vacation time to enable them to rest and recharge.Our teachers are strongly encouraged to share and discuss their concerns about workload with their supervisors and school leaders. Should they need emotional and psychological support, there are dedicated professional counsellors within MOE who provide counselling support to individual teachers. These professional counsellors also conduct workshops for teachers in areas such as managing difficult conversations and work with the teachers on stress management.The well-being of our teachers is important and we will continue to support them in managing their work and workload."
discontinuation of hardship scheme for hawkers,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what are the reasons for the discontinuation since 1989 of subsidised stalls under the Government's hardship scheme in markets/hawker centres managed by NEA; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider reinstating this scheme.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Under the old Hardship Scheme, vacant hawker stalls were offered to those experiencing financial hardship at subsidised rent. However, the take-up rate was low as most hardship cases preferred to hold out for a vacant stall only in the more popular centres. Due to its limited effectiveness, this scheme was discontinued in 1990. Today, anyone can bid for vacant hawker stalls which NEA puts up for tender every month.There are no plans to reinstate the scheme. To be successful and sustain a hawker stall, a hawker requires entrepreneurship and passion, no different from any business. It would, therefore, make more sense to let those who are genuinely interested in the hawker trade to bid for stalls, as they will have built in both the risks and the gains. It is not tenable to ring-fence a certain number of stalls for those in financial difficulty and believe they will automatically succeed. Those who face financial hardship can seek assistance through the various Government help schemes available."
criteria for granting foreign entity permit to engage in activities relating to speakers' corner events,Mr Seah Kian Peng asked the Minister for Home Affairs what criteria will be used to determine whether a foreign entity gets a permit to engage in activities relating to a Speakers' Corner event.,"Mr K Shanmugam: On 21 October 2016, the Ministry of Home Affairs announced changes to the Public Order (Unrestricted Area) Order 2016 to reinforce the principle that the Speakers’ Corner was set up primarily for Singaporeans. These changes came into effect on 1 November 2016.The changes include allowing Singapore entities to organise or assist to organise events at the Speakers’ Corner without the need for a permit, subject to the conditions in the Order. This is an extension of the existing exemption for Singapore citizens to organise events without the need for a permit.Non-Singapore entities were not previously exempted, and continue not to be exempted. As such, a permit will be required if a non-Singapore entity organises or assists to organise an event at the Speakers’ Corner. This includes sponsoring, publicly promoting the event, or organising its members or employees to participate in the event.Police will assess such applications on a case-by-case basis. Some factors that the Police will consider include- Whether the event poses law and order concerns; and- Whether the event addresses issues pertaining to race and religion.In addition to the above considerations, a permit will not be granted to foreigners, including non-Singapore entities, if the event relates to political or controversial social issues."
welfare of animals bred in local pet farms,Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked the Minister for National Development what checks and enforcement measurements are in place to ensure the welfare of animals being bred in our local pet farms and whether AVA has sufficient certified personnel to conduct these inspections.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: There are legislative provisions to safeguard animal welfare under AVA’s Animals and Birds Act (ABA). Under the Act, all owners owe a duty of care to the animals under their charge.For pet farms, AVA imposes additional licensing conditions to safeguard the welfare of animals that are bred and sold. Licensees have to fulfil stringent requirements on healthcare and the living environment of their animals.In August 2016, AVA issued a Code of Animal Welfare for the pet industry. It applies to all pet farms and shops, as well as pet businesses not licensed by AVA like pet groomers. This Code stipulates minimum requirements for kennel spaces, housekeeping, diet and feeding etc. Non-compliance can lead to enforcement action by AVA.AVA has enough trained officers to conduct regular spot checks on pet farms. However, as animal welfare is a shared responsibility, we also encourage the public to be vigilant and to report errant pet farms to AVA. Enforcement aside, AVA will also continue to work with the pet industry to raise animal welfare standards through partnership and education."
complaints of misconduct against lta enforcement officers,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Transport (a) since the deployment of LTA enforcement officers, how many complaints have been received and what action have been taken against these officers for misconduct; (b) what is the procedure to lodge a complaint against these officers; (c) what is the training given to these officers; and (d) whether the Ministry considers the temperament of the candidates before appointing them as enforcement officers.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: LTA has received 499 complaints against its enforcement officers this year, of which 74 were found to be valid. These 74 complaints were against outsourced enforcement officers. LTA investigates these complaints and takes appropriate action against officers found guilty of misconduct, which can range from counselling to dismissal.Members of the public who wish to lodge a complaint against LTA’s enforcement officers can do so via email, text message or an online feedback form. The information can be found on LTA’s website.LTA's enforcement officers are indeed assessed for suitability for the job, including temperament. They undergo training that includes code of conduct, rules of engagement, and how to handle members of the public."
teachers who offer tuition services outside school hours,Mr Seah Kian Peng asked the Minister for Education (Schools) how many teachers in primary and secondary schools currently give tuition after their working hours.,Mr Ng Chee Meng: MOE currently does not track the number of teachers who give tuition.Teachers are allowed to provide private tuition outside school hours as long as it does not exceed six hours a week and does not adversely affect their work in school. They are not required to seek permission to do so.MOE has an interest in ensuring that such activities do not adversely affect teachers’ ability to discharge their duties. The Ministry is planning to collect information on such activities on a regular basis and is considering different options for doing so.
impact of transboundary haze pollution act on air quality,Mr Ong Teng Koon asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) to what extent the improvement in air quality this year can be attributed to the Transboundary Haze Pollution Act; and (b) how can it be ensured that the problem does not resurface in future years.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: There have been more occurrences of rain in the region, in particular over Sumatra and Kalimantan, during the traditional dry season from June to October this year as compared to the same period in 2015. The wetter weather has helped to alleviate the hotspots and smoke haze situation in the region. We also appreciate the Indonesians’ efforts to prevent and mitigate the forest fires on the ground. Air quality in 2016 has therefore been better than that in 2015. In 2016, we have so far only recorded four ""Unhealthy"" days. In comparison, there were 40 ""Unhealthy"" days, five ""Very Unhealthy"" days and one ""Hazardous"" day in 2015.Nevertheless, we need to be mindful that transboundary haze has been a persistent problem in our region, and we cannot prematurely conclude that it is behind us because of one good year. The international community has become increasingly aware that eradicating haze in our region is crucial to the global fight against climate change. The 2015 haze episode in our region was found to occur mostly on degraded peatlands, which are major carbon sinks. According to a recent scientific study conducted by scientists from the Netherlands, Britain and Indonesia, the 2015 fires in Indonesia had generated 850 million tonnes of greenhouse gases. This is more than half of the 1.5 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide that was saved from the increased use of renewable energy by the whole world in 2015.Fundamentally, the main cause of transboundary haze in our region remains commercially driven. This means that there must be continual efforts to get companies in the pulp and paper and the palm oil industries to adopt environmentally sustainable practices that do not contribute to smoke haze.One key measure is the Transboundary Haze Pollution Act (THPA) which seeks to hold haze-causing companies accountable and deter entities from engaging in activities that would contribute to haze in Singapore. The National Environment Agency (NEA) has sent a number of Notices under the THPA and investigations are still on-going. We will take the necessary steps to enforce the THPA, while bearing in mind that we also have to operate within the ambit of international law. We will hold any Singapore-linked persons or entities to account. At the same time, even if the errant company’s officers are foreigners, they will have to comply with the laws of the country, including the Notices under the THPA, should they come to Singapore. As the THPA has only been in force for a short time, we cannot draw any conclusions on its effectiveness, as this will only be apparent over the longer term.Apart from regulatory deterrence, it is also important for consumers at various levels of the supply chain, in Singapore and our region, to send a strong signal against practices that contribute to the haze. Recently, NTUC FairPrice shared that their FairPrice house brand edible oils that contain palm oil are from sources certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). This is indeed commendable. In addition, ground-up initiatives by Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) can also complement this. For example, the formation of the Singapore Alliance on Sustainable Palm Oil in June this year has helped to raise public awareness on the use of Certified Sustainable Palm Oil (CSPO).This builds upon what has been happening globally. In April 2016, consumer groups including Nestle, Unilever, Mars and Kellogg suspended business with IOI Group after a decision by the RSPO to suspend certification for the company’s palm oil. This suspension was due to IOI’s failure to prevent its subsidiaries’ involvement in deforestation in Indonesia in 2015. Even with the RSPO restoring IOI’s certification in August 2016, consumer groups such as Unilever had indicated that they do not intend to resume business with IOI Group until they see tangible progress in IOI’s declared remedial action plan.Lastly, regional cooperation is also essential in our fight against transboundary haze. We continue to support initiatives that can help prevent future occurrences of the haze at regional fora, such as ASEAN. For example, Singapore hosts the ASEAN Specialised Meteorological Centre (ASMC), which provides daily hotspot information and other monitoring and assessment functions for the region. We also contribute to the capacity building efforts in the region through workshops under the Regional Haze Training Network for ASEAN Member States (AMS). In addition, Singapore has been actively participating in the Sub-Regional Ministerial Steering Committee (MSC) on Transboundary Haze Pollution to ensure that regional countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei and Thailand undertake collective action to tackle the haze problem. We had also developed an ASEAN Sub-regional Haze Monitoring System (AHMS) to improve transparency and accountability on companies and to promote sustainable land clearing practices by the land owners, and have been working with MSC countries to operationalise the AHMS.In August this year, the Roadmap on ASEAN Cooperation towards Transboundary Haze Pollution Control with Means of Implementation was formally adopted by AMS at the 12th Conference of Parties to the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution in Kuala Lumpur. It serves as a strategic framework to implement collaborative actions to achieve a vision of ""Transbounday Haze-Free ASEAN by 2020"".We must press on with our efforts, not just during the haze season, but consistently throughout the year because haze is a serious environmental disaster with wide-ranging impact for us now, and into the future. Irresponsible burning over the years has affected the health of millions of people, impacted regional economies, and caused irreversible loss of biodiversity. We cannot rest on our past efforts and must continue to urge all relevant parties to work together towards realising a haze-free ASEAN by 2020 if not earlier."
housing and flat rental assistance for single unwed moms,Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) how does the Ministry work with HDB to solve housing issues of single unwed mothers who are too well-off to qualify for a rental flat but too poor to buy a flat; (b) why does the Ministry believe that home ownership and not rental access is the better long-term solution to help families escape poverty; and (c) how does the Ministry help single mothers balance the financial trade-offs between working for more income versus having their rental go up once their income goes up.,"Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: Single unwed parents with housing difficulties can approach HDB for assistance and advice on their housing options. Where necessary, HDB would refer the parents to MSF and social service agencies for counselling and support. MSF works closely with HDB and social service agencies to help address their family and relationship issues and to provide financial and employment assistance. Each family will be assisted based on their individual circumstances, and the agencies will work with them to achieve housing stability.We believe that homeownership is a better long-term solution for families than rental because it provides a greater sense of stability and gives families an asset, allowing them to share in Singapore’s progress. Monthly instalments for sold flats can also be paid using CPF monies, unlike rental housing which must be paid in cash. This will save some cash for families and help them with their immediate cash positions.HDB also recognises the needs of low-income households who cannot afford to own a flat immediately and have no family support, and provides public rental flats as temporary housing for them. Public rental tenants with higher incomes pay higher rent than those with lower incomes. This ensures that subsidies are progressive and targeted at those who need more help. However, HDB also exercises flexibility. For instance, for tenants whose monthly income has just improved from the lowest income tier to the next, HDB could waive their rent increase at tenancy renewal so that they can continue to pay the lower rent for another two years. After two years, if their income increase is still low relative to the rent increase, HDB will continue to waive the rent increase for another two years.With these waivers, tenants effectively have up to four years to improve their incomes to be better off than before, even after taking into account any rental increases. We thus encourage tenants to focus on improving their incomes. This is a surer and better way to increase disposable incomes, and to eventually go beyond public rental to homeownership.Families who face difficulties can continue to approach their nearest Social Service Office or Family Service Centre for assistance."
number of smokers and patients with smoking-related diseases,"Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the number of patients with diseases caused by smoking has fallen in the last three years; (b) whether the number of smokers, especially those aged 30 years and below, has decreased; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider reducing hospital subsidies for active smokers as a deterrent measure.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Based on the two most recent national health surveys conducted in 2010 and 2013, smoking prevalence among those aged 18 to 69 years declined slightly from 14.3% to 13.3%. Amongst those aged 30 years and below, smoking prevalence decreased more significantly from 16.8% to 13.4%.The age-standardised hospitalisation rates of Singapore residents for smoking-related diseases fell slightly over the last three years, from 15.8 per 1,000 residents in 2013 to 15.4 per 1,000 residents in 2014 and 15.0 per 1,000 residents in 2015.Reducing hospital subsidies for smokers as a deterrent measure could result in unintended consequences, for example patients may delay seeking treatment, which can increase the risk of complications and further affect their health.We want to focus on helping smokers to quit smoking. The Ministry of Health has developed a comprehensive tobacco control plan with both legislative and non-legislative measures to encourage smokers to quit and discourage non-smokers, especially youth, from picking up smoking.The Health Promotion Board has more than 200 smoking cessation touchpoints, including healthcare institutions and retail pharmacies in the community. Smokers who want to quit smoking can also seek help through the toll-free QuitLine and available online resources."
concrete slabs covering water tanks at roof-tops of hdb flats,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development whether HDB can explore building concrete slabs over water tanks and pipes at the roof top of old HDB flats or other effective methods to cover the tanks and pipes to prevent them from being exposed under strong sunlight as a result of which water flowing out from the taps in the flats will not be overly hot for use.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: In older HDB blocks, the water tanks are housed in the roof top water tank rooms, which are not exposed to direct sunlight. Hence, water tanks might not be the cause of the feedback on hot water flowing out of the taps of some flats during hot weather. The likely cause is exposure of the main water distribution pipes to the sun’s heat, especially for pipes running over a long distance due to the block’s configuration of a long span.It is thus doubtful that the suggestion to build concrete slabs as shelter for the tanks and pipes will address the problem. In addition, the building structure and rooftop of HDB blocks may not be designed to take such additional load. There are other feasible ways to mitigate the extent of water pipes being heated up. Town Councils could install rigid PVC pipes as a cover over the water pipes to provide some insulation. For shorter water pipes, reflective paints could also be used to reflect solar radiation."
impact on carpark provisions with redevelopment of golden shoe complex,Mr Ang Wei Neng asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the impact on carpark provisions in the CBD when Golden Shoe Carpark is developed into an office building; and (b) whether the Ministry is revising the carpark provision guidelines of shopping centres and office buildings inside and outside the CBD.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: There are adequate parking lots in the vicinity of Golden Shoe Car Park, even if it is redeveloped into an office building. There are also many public transport options, with two MRT stations on three different lines and 50 bus services serving the area.LTA will revise its requirements for the provision of car parks from time to time, in tandem with the expansion of our public transport network and in line with our car-lite strategy."
quality control for lift installation and maintenance,"Ms Tin Pei Ling asked the Minister for National Development (a) what are the quality control measures in place for new public housing developments; (b) what will qualify newly-installed lifts as ""lemons""; (c) whether ""lemon lifts"" should be accepted; (d) whether the Ministry will require the lift company to replace the ""lemon lifts""; and (e) whether the Ministry will require the lift company to replace the lifts at Block 17B Circuit Road that have been persistently faulty since key collection.","79 Ms Sun Xueling asked the Minister for National Development where the Town Council has done its duty to require lift contractors to conduct maintenance works, engaged specialised cleaners to clean lifts of debris and enforced policing of errant renovation contractors and yet lifts still break down in new estates like Punggol (a) what enforcement action can HDB take against lift manufacturers to protect residents affected by lift malfunctions; and (b) whether HDB requires lift manufacturers to replace lifts that have shown a systemic record of malfunctioning.80 Ms Sun Xueling asked the Minister for National Development where a lift contractor has systematically shown an inability to rectify lift faults and the Town Council is stuck with the lift contractor as the sole proprietor of its technology and cannot go to other maintenance contractors, what recourse is available in the procurement contract between HDB and the lift contractor that can be relied upon to protect the interests of residents.81 Ms Sun Xueling asked the Minister for National Development whether HDB will consider (i) making a change in the design and use of lifts to stipulate that only one lift in a HDB block can be used for renovation and moving purposes so that the other lift in the HDB block can be dedicated to resident's daily use; and (ii) pre-installing CCTV cameras in lifts so as to monitor the behaviour of HDB licensed contractors and ensure the safety of residents during the renovation and moving-in period.Mr Lawrence Wong: Lifts are an integral part of our urbanised, high-rise living environment. With some 24,000 lifts located in public housing estates, all of which are used on a high-frequency and daily basis, HDB takes a serious view of lift safety and reliability. This starts from the beginning at the lift procurement and commissioning stages, where HDB has in place a system of stringent quality control measures.First, HDB has a two-stage lift procurement process which takes into account the quality and reliability of lift contractors. At the first stage, lift contractors must meet a minimum criteria set by HDB - including the performance and track record of their proposed brand of lift. At the second stage, proposals are evaluated further with the Price-Quality Method (PQM), in which attributes such as the lift contractor's performance, safety performance, and again, lift performance are taken into consideration.Second, before a lift is commissioned and turned on for operation, it is put under a series of checks and tests that are supervised by a third party Authorised Examiner. This is a regulatory requirement. To better ascertain the quality of lift installation and performance, HDB also conducts (i) an independent audit of key safety features; and (ii) a stress test of 1,000 start-stop operations. These additional tests are over and above existing regulatory requirements.Third, after the lift is commissioned, HDB's term contracts provide for a one-year Defects Liability Period (DLP) – during which HDB imposes a requirement of not more than one lift breakdown per 10 lifts per month. Lift contractors that fail to meet this will be restricted from tendering for future HDB tenders unless they show improvements. Other penalties include imposing liquidated damages on the contractor or debarment from all public sector works.These are the quality control measures in place from procurement up to the one-year DLP. Beyond the DLP, Town Councils enter into a separate maintenance agreement with their chosen lift contractors – be it the Original Equipment Manufacturer or a third-party lift contractor. Town Councils will have to specify their desired lift performance standards in their maintenance agreements.On Ms Sun Xueling's concern about proprietary lift parts, I agree that it is important to ensure that third-party lift maintenance contractors have access to essential lift spare parts. This is so that Town Councils can choose the best contractor to do the job. The Competition Commission of Singapore has been investigating potentially anti-competitive behavior in the lift industry.Ms Tin Pei Ling and Ms Sun have asked whether HDB requires lift companies responsible for lift installation to replace lifts which are persistently faulty. In addressing lift faults, HDB takes a targeted approach to address the root causes of the issue. In the case of Block 17B Circuit Road, the high number of door-related faults in its new lifts abated after the lift company made adjustments such that the door is less susceptible to misalignment caused by lift users.Typically, lifts in new blocks experience such problems due to damage caused by renovation contractors and furniture movers who use objects to jam doors or leave debris on door sills. A replacement of the lift would not have addressed the issue. It may also incur more lift downtime and inconvenience to residents.Ms Sun has also suggested for HDB to consider designating one lift in each HDB block for renovation or moving purposes. HDB had previously conducted a pilot by designating a passenger lift in HDB blocks as a ‘service lift’. However, due to unbalanced usage patterns, the average waiting time for lift users increased significantly. This may bring about more frustration and inconvenience for residents.On Ms Sun's other suggestion to pre-install CCTV cameras in lifts, HDB has started installing a Lift Surveillance System (LSS) in all new HDB blocks from 1st July this year.To sum up, HDB has in place a set of comprehensive quality control measures for the procurement of lifts. Nonetheless, all of us – the HDB, residents and also the Town Councils for lift maintenance - will have to work together to ensure that lifts remain well-functioning and safe for everyday use. We will continue to see how we can tighten our processes and standards to ensure that our lifts are reliable and perform as intended."
"safety measures for rides at fun fairs, carnivals and theme parks","Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for National Development what measures are in place to ensure the safety of amusement rides including those at fun fairs, carnivals and theme parks and how often are safety enforcement and spot checks by qualified inspectors performed.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Amusement rides in Singapore are regulated under the Amusement Rides Safety Act (ARSA) administered by BCA. Under this regulatory framework, permits are required for the installation, modification and operation of amusement rides. Regular maintenance and inspections are also required. This framework ensures that rides are designed, maintained and operated according to internationally recognised safety codes and standards.For the installation of new rides and for major modifications to existing rides, a Qualified Person has to be appointed to review and certify the plans and safety assessments based on the technical codes. The Qualified Person must be a Specialist Professional Engineer registered with the Professional Engineers Board in the discipline of Amusement Rides Engineering.The ride operator oversees the safety of ride operations. Among other requirements, the ride operator needs to appoint a Ride Manager to manage and supervise the daily operation and routine maintenance of the ride. For example, the Ride Manager needs to ensure a thorough inspection before opening the ride for public use each day, and that only persons trained to operate the ride can do so.In addition, amusement rides are required to undergo annual inspections and certifications by a Qualified Person. For major rides, the Qualified Person carrying out the inspection will need to be advised by a Conformity Assessor – a third party technical expert in assessing amusement rides.BCA also conducts inspections on the operation and maintenance of the rides. In 2015, BCA conducted about 300 inspections on the 110 rides in Singapore. If safety issues are detected, BCA will take enforcement action such as suspending the operations.We will continue to work closely with the industry to ensure that our amusement rides are designed, maintained, and operated according to prescribed safety standards. Ride users can also play a part in creating a safe and fun experience for themselves by adhering to the ride safety guidelines."
ramps for hdb flats with steps at entrances,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the number of HDB flats that have multiple steps at the flats' entrance; (b) whether HDB has plans to install ramps for such flats at a subsidised cost to residents who need it for easier accessibility; and (c) when will be the estimated earliest time that ramps can be installed for such flats in view of the ageing population.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Some older HDB flats built in the 1970s and 1980s were designed with multi-step entrances to offer more privacy and added security for occupants of the flats. HDB estimates that there are more than 100,000 of such units. With an ageing population, elderly residents and wheelchair users living in these flats may now face difficulties negotiating the steps. HDB has been carefully studying this issue.There are challenges in implementing a common solution across blocks of different configurations. Any solution will likely have to be customised to the flat configuration, corridor space availability and the residents' needs, without posing maintenance issues or obstructing the fire escape route.When we have developed the appropriate solutions, we could implement them as an expansion of Enhancement for Active Seniors (EASE) or through other programmes. HDB is also exploring with other agencies the options for financial assistance that could be provided for low income families who may need such ramps or platforms.Meanwhile, residents who wish to engage a private vendor to install customised ramps today can approach the HDB Branches. HDB is working towards offering a one-stop application service for residents by coordinating the application with the relevant regulatory agencies. This will make it easier for residents to install such ramps. Residents who need financial help for the ramp installation may also approach VWOs or their Advisers for assistance."
temporary centre for hawkers affected by fire at jurong west market and coffeeshop,"Mr Ang Wei Neng asked the Minister for National Development with regard to the Jurong West market and coffeeshop which have been affected by a recent fire, whether HDB can consider funding, fully or partially, the building of a temporary market/ hawker centre while waiting for the completion of the permanent building.","Mr Lawrence Wong: In the event of a fire to HDB markets and eating houses which renders the premises unfit for use, HDB’s priority is to rebuild the replacement premises as soon as possible. This is to minimise the impact on the affected stallholders, and facilitate the return to normalcy for their business operations as soon as possible. HDB will bear the full cost of building the replacement premises.In the interim, HDB and other government agencies have provided immediate assistance and coordinated for help to be extended to the affected stallholders of Jurong West market. For instance, HDB has waived the rental for the operator of the market during the interim period when the replacement premises are being built. The Temporary Occupation License (or TOL) fees for the State Land on which the temporary market will be built, will also be waived In addition, NEA has offered the affected stallholders available market and food stalls where they can conduct their businesses in the interim. More recently, the People’s Association and the Employment and Employability Institute (e2i) have held a job fair to assist the stallholders in finding alternative employment.These measures complement the commendable efforts of the Adviser, grassroots leaders and community in raising funds for the construction of the temporary market. We will continue to monitor the situation, and provide further assistance to the stall holders where needed."
lifts for private buildings more than three storeys in height,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the number of private buildings above three storeys that do not have lifts installed; and (b) whether there are plans to ensure or encourage owners of such private buildings to install lifts for easier accessibility by the elderly and less able-bodied.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Currently, our Building Control Regulations require buildings of five storeys or more to be provided with passenger lifts. Lift provision is not mandatory for buildings under five storeys. Hence, about 370 existing low rise commercial and institutional buildings do not have lifts installed.To nudge private building owners to voluntarily upgrade their buildings, BCA provides incentives via the $40-million Accessibility Fund. The Fund co-pays up to 80% of the construction costs for lift provision, capped at $300,000 per development. To date, the Fund has supported lift installations in 79 developments. We have recently extended the availability of the Fund until March 2022."
operating cost considerations in transport fare reviews,"Assoc Prof Randolph Tan asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether in decisions on fare reviews, the Public Transport Council balances considerations of the operating cost structure of public transport operators with ratings by commuters of the quality of their service; and (b) if it does not, what are the reasons for not doing so.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The Public Transport Council's decisions on fare reviews are guided by the fare formula, which was last reviewed by the Fare Review Mechanism Committee in 2013. The decision then was to address the issue of service quality outside of the formula, so that the Government can regulate and work with the operators independently to improve service levels. This approach keeps the fare formula relatively straightforward, without the complication of differentiating fare adjustments on account of service quality.More importantly, it does not hinder our efforts to raise service levels. Since 2013, the rail network has been expanded by 20 kilometres and the train fleet for the North-South and East-West Lines (NSEWL), North East Line (NEL) and Circle Line (CCL) has increased by about 25%, significantly alleviating train crowding. As part of the Bus Service Enhancement Programme implemented from 2012, 820 of the 1,000 buses planned for have been deployed on the roads. In line with these service level improvements, the percentage of commuters expressing satisfaction with our public transport services rose from 88.5% in 2013 to 91.8% in 2015.With the transition to the Bus Contracting Model and the New Rail Financing Framework, we expect service levels to improve further. However, the cost of improving service levels, and the corresponding extent of Government subsidies for public transport, will also increase. For instance, under bus contracting, the Government will be subsidising about $3.5 to $4 billion in the next five years. Similarly, on the rail side, due to the Government taking over ownership of the operating assets under the New Rail Financing Framework, the Government expects to spend over $4 billion on renewing, upgrading and expanding operating assets over the next five years. These will be on top of the $20 billion that the Government has committed to spend on building new rail lines in the same period. We are also requiring the rail operators to invest more heavily in maintenance to raise our rail reliability substantially. Realistically, it is neither possible nor sustainable to improve service standards without having fares keep pace with the rising costs.The current fare formula is valid for five years including for the 2017 fare exercise. The PTC will review the formula before its expiry next year, and take into context the changes to the public transport landscape. A fine balance is necessary to ensure that our public transport system remains financially and operationally viable while fares remain affordable."
encouraging residents and volunteers to help curb high-rise littering,"Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources instead of increasing deployment of cameras and enforcement staff to curb high-rise littering, whether the Ministry will consider enhancing ground enforcement by allowing residents on patrol or designated volunteers to submit evidence of the offence and enable NEA to take immediate action against the offenders.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: High-rise littering is an anti-social act and can be a serious offence which poses safety and hygiene problems to the public. However, due to the nature of the offence and our densely built-up housing estates, high-rise litterbugs can be difficult to identify and apprehend.When feedback on high-rise littering is received, the National Environment Agency (NEA) will work with the Town Councils and grassroots organisations to conduct outreach efforts to educate residents not to commit high-rise littering. The offences would usually cease after such outreach efforts. Where there are cases of persistent high-rise littering despite such efforts, NEA would deploy surveillance cameras at suitable vantage points to identify and apprehend the high-rise litterbugs.Between August 2012 and June 2016, NEA conducted more than 3,400 camera deployments and took more than 2,800 enforcement actions against high-rise litterbugs. The camera deployments have helped to increase the number of enforcement actions 90-fold since 2011 when surveillance cameras were first introduced. Today, officers are only stationed on the ground in a small number of cases where the deployment of cameras is not possible.We welcome the suggestion from MP Cheryl Chan and encourage members of the public, including residents on patrol or designated volunteers, to provide any information or evidence of high-rise littering offences including video footage which can help NEA to conduct investigations to establish the identity of the offender and take appropriate enforcement action.Beyond enforcement efforts, it is important to involve the community and educate our young to take ownership of the environment. To this end, NEA, together with the Public Hygiene Council and partners of the Keep Singapore Clean Movement, have been working closely with the Ministry of Education to inculcate in students, the habit of keeping their homes, school compounds and common areas in the neighbourhood clean.We will also continue to work with the community to ensure that our enforcement and outreach efforts are effective in discouraging such inconsiderate and potentially criminal behaviour so that everyone can live in a clean and safe environment."
publicity of workplace safety practices by premises owners,"Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for Manpower what are the efforts undertaken to ensure that (i) premise owners publicize safe workplace practices or make adequate provisions to ensure that independent contractors operating in their premises are protected from workplace incidents; (ii) service buyers play an active role in safety discussions with independent contractors that they engage so that the incidents can be avoided; and (iii) greater publicity, training and educational efforts are channelled to creating safer workplaces for independent contractors.","Mr Lim Swee Say: Under the Workplace Safety and Health Act, premise owners have to take reasonably practicable measures to ensure that their premises are safe for workers, including independent contractors. As required by the Act, premise owners need to conduct risk assessment to eliminate or mitigate any foreseeable risks before work activity can commence.Service buyers also play an important role in ensuring the safety and health of independent contractors. For instance, service buyers are encouraged to adopt the bizSAFE programme, introduced by the WSH Council, to build in-house WSH capabilities in risk management. They can even go a step further to procure services only from bizSAFE certified contractors.Workplace Safety and Health is everyone's responsibility. Independent contractors can take steps to enhance their workplace safety and health capabilities. They can enrol in safety and health courses offered by accredited training providers. They can access the wide range of free WSH information and toolkits, customised to suit different industry trades, on the WSH Council website. NTUC has set up the Freelancers and Self-Employed Unit (FSEU) to reach out to self-employed and independent contractors. FSEU can work with MOM and WSH Council to enhance WSH awareness and competency of freelancers and independent contractors.On a broader front, MOM and the WSH Council have stepped up WSH awareness activities all year round, including organising engagement forums in collaboration with industry partners. A WSH Campaign highlighting seven common causes of workplace safety incidents in hotspots such as working at heights and safe lifting operations was launched since June this year. The campaign educates workers, including independent contractors, on simple and practical measures to prevent injuries at work through pictograms. These are disseminated through the mass media, television commercials, radio advertisements and outdoor media.WSH is a collective responsibility of all stakeholders. Independent contractors too should play their part and ensure that they carry out work in a safe manner. MOM and WSH Council will continue to work closely with our tripartite partners to create safer workplaces for all workers, including independent contractors."
evidence that legal online gambling reduces illegal online gambling and would not result in overall increase in gambler numbers,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether, to what extent and by what evidence the experience of Hong Kong and Norway (or that of any other countries studied by the Ministry) demonstrates that allowing some legal online gambling will (i) cause a significant switch of current illegal gamblers to legal gambling and (ii) not cause a significant expansion in the total population of gamblers for both legal and illegal gamblers.","Mr K Shanmugam: Similar to Singapore, Hong Kong and Norway have also allowed authorised operators to complement a general prohibition of remote gambling. These authorised operators run remote gambling services in a highly regulated environment.The nature of remote gambling, especially underground illegal gambling, is such that it is hard to get accurate details of the extent or the exact number of people who are gambling. There may be a range of estimates, and this applies to any jurisdiction.There are some studies and analyst reports on the experiences of Hong Kong and Norway. They suggest that an exempt operator regime can mitigate the extent of unauthorised remote gambling.Hong Kong’s authorised operator, Hong Kong Jockey Club (HKJC), launched its online betting service in 2001, and its mobile app-based betting in 2011. A report from H2GC consultancy estimates that the share of the remote gambling market in Hong Kong attributed to unauthorised offshore operators halved, between 2003 and 2015.Norway’s authorised operator, Norsk Tipping, launched online casino games in 2014. Gambling prevalence studies commissioned by the Norwegian Gaming and Foundation Authority indicate that the percentage of Norwegians who played illegal online casino games decreased by about one-fifth between 2013 and 2015.Hong Kong and Norway's experience also suggest that allowing for authorised operators has not resulted in higher gambling participation rates.Studies commissioned by the Home Affairs Bureau in Hong Kong indicate that the share of the Hong Kong population that participated in gambling decreased from about 78% in 2001 to 62% in 2011.Studies commissioned by the Norwegian Gaming and Foundation Authority indicate that the share of the Norwegian population that participated in gambling decreased from about 70% in 2007 to 58% in 2015.Even as we take into account the experiences of other jurisdictions, we need to be careful about drawing strict parallels with them. Notably, the social context and the regulatory environment differ from one jurisdiction to another.So while we learn from their experiences, we will continue to closely monitor the situation in Singapore and make adjustments if necessary, to ensure that our Exempt Operator regime achieves its objective of mitigating law-and-order and social concerns arising from unauthorised gambling."
extent of hdb's authority in water leakage repair incidents where homeowners are uncooperative,Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for National Development to what extent is HDB empowered to act in cases where water leakage occurs between floors and one of the parties refuses to cooperate to resolve the issue.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Flat owners are responsible to maintain the interior of their flats. In the case of ceiling leaks, both the upper and lower floor flat owners are jointly responsible, as provided for under the HDB Lease. Since 2001, HDB has provided assistance through the Goodwill Repair Assistance (GRA) Scheme by arranging for the repair works and co-paying 50% of the cost. The upper- and lower-floor flat owners share the remaining 50% equally.While the GRA scheme has helped many flat owners, HDB has encountered some upper-floor flat owners who do not cooperate and delay the repair unnecessarily.For such cases, HDB will engage the upper floor flat owners to seek their cooperation to carry out the repairs. Grassroots leaders may also step in to persuade them to cooperate. If all these efforts fail, HDB may apply for a Court Order to compel the upper floor flat owner to carry out the repairs. If the owner refuses to comply with the Court Order, the owner may be found in contempt of Court, which could result in a fine or jail term.As a last resort, Section 26A of the Housing & Development (Amendments) Act 2015 grants HDB the power to enter a flat with a warrant to carry out urgent repairs. This will help to address urgent and serious cases of ceiling leaks which can be a source of distress or even potential danger to residents if not resolved in a timely manner. HDB will only use these powers sparingly, after exhausting all other avenues to get the owner's cooperation."
service standards for hdb's replies to residents,"Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for National Development what service standards and operating procedures does HDB apply when replying to residents on their feedback, complaints and requests for rectification of defects.","Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB will rectify defects for new HDB flats covered under the one-year Defects Liability Period. In addition, HDB provides new flat owners with extended warranty coverage for three major defect types: five years for ceiling leakages and external seepage, and 10 years for spalling concrete.During the one-year Defects Liability Period, HDB sets up a Building Service Centre within the precinct to facilitate the defects reporting and rectification process for residents. When flat owners report defects directly at the Building Service Centre, they get to choose a date on the spot for joint inspection with HDB's contractor, to verify the defects.For flat owners who send in their feedback via email or letters, the BSC will contact them within three working days to schedule the joint inspection.HDB aims to complete the rectification works within 14 working days. In exceptional or complicated cases where more time is required, flat owners will be informed of the expected completion date. Upon completion of rectification works, another joint inspection with the flat owner will be carried out to ensure that rectification works are carried out satisfactorily.For issues that may arise beyond the one-year Defects Liability Period, HDB will contact the flat owners within three working days of receiving the feedback, and advise flat owners accordingly. The appropriate follow-up action will depend on the nature and complexity of the defects. This is because such defects may be caused by a variety of reasons, such as the workmanship of HDB's building contractors or the flat owners’ own actions."
actions against foreign entities that undermine singapore's racial or religious harmony,Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether the laws of Singapore can be strengthened to ensure that our social and racial harmony will not be adversely affected by malicious lies published by foreign entities and which may have the effect of undermining racial or religious harmony.,"Mr K Shanmugam: Racial and religious harmony is fundamental to Singapore’s peace and prosperity as a nation. Our laws against the incitement of hatred and disharmony between racial and religious groups are contained in the Penal Code, Sedition Act and Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act. The Telecommunications Act also includes a provision that criminalises the sending of false messages. Offences under these laws are subject to imprisonment or a fine, or both, for a first offence. For example, Section 298A of the Penal Code criminalises the promotion of enmity between different groups on grounds of religion or race, or any act which is prejudicial to the maintenance of harmony between different religious and racial groups. The offence under Section 298A is punishable with imprisonment of up to three years, or a fine or both. Under the Sedition Act, it is an offence to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different races or classes of the population of Singapore, which is punishable with imprisonment of up to three years or a fine of up to $5,000 or both, for a first offence. Subsequent offences are dealt with more severely.There have been prosecutions for transgressions.We should have no tolerance for those who seek to undermine Singapore’s racial and religious harmony. The Government will continue to take a tough stand against those who seek to do so.We will review our legislation, to ensure that they remain relevant."
contingency when lift companies exit singapore's market,Ms Tin Pei Ling asked the Minister for National Development (a) what will be the impact if a lift company folds or withdraws from Singapore; and (b) what is the Ministry's contingency plan when such an event occurs.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Singapore has an open and competitive market for lift installation and maintenance works. Lift owners can choose from a list of more than 100 lift contractors registered with BCA. This includes Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and third-party contractors. Given this range, if any lift contractor were to fold up or withdraw from Singapore, there would be other contractors for lift owners to engage.There may be concern about the ability to procure proprietary lift parts if an OEM were to fold or withdraw from Singapore. But this can be addressed. For instance, contractors can source parts from the OEM if it is still operating outside of Singapore. They can also look for compatible parts from other local suppliers. Yet another option is for contractors to consider modifying the lifts to use other types of parts that are available.For cases involving lifts in public housing estates, HDB will work with the relevant Town Councils to ensure a smooth transition by bringing on board another lift company that provides interim support and maintenance of the lifts. This will cover residents until a fresh tender for the maintenance contract is called and awarded by the Town Council. Where necessary, HDB will also work with the Town Council to assist in looking for appropriate replacement parts for the lifts."
motor vehicle accidents involving injury or death of elderly,Dr Tan Wu Meng asked the Minister for Transport over the past three years (a) what proportion of motor vehicle accidents involving elderly pedestrians resulted in (i) serious injuries or (ii) fatalities; and (b) what plans will the Ministry put in place to further enhance the safety of road crossings and reduce the incidence of such accidents.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: From January 2013 to August 2016, 4% of motor vehicle accidents involving elderly pedestrians resulted in serious injuries, and 11% in fatality.To enhance road safety for pedestrians, especially seniors, LTA introduced the Silver Zone programme in 2014. In the nine locations where Silver Zones have been implemented, so far, only one accident involving seniors has occurred, compared to more than 40 accidents in the five-year period preceding Silver Zones. We plan to expand to 50 locations in total by 2023. We have also introduced and are expanding other road safety features for seniors, such as the Green Man Plus programme, and road dividers at pedestrian crossings which allow seniors to pause safely in the middle of the road before resuming their crossing."
inclusion of slightly older lifts in lift enhancement programme,Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry will exercise flexibility in the qualifying criteria for the Lift Enhancement Programme and allow lifts that are marginally older than the 18-year threshold to qualify for the programme.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The Lift Enhancement Programme (LEP) is a significant effort by the Government to help the Town Councils to modernise their existing lifts. It is estimated to cost around $450 million, and will have to be implemented over a number of years. As a guide, HDB intends to implement the LEP for lifts that have been in operation for 18 years or less, as it makes more sense for the older lifts to be fully replaced by the Town Councils themselves. But HDB is still working out the implementation details of the LEP, including the detailed eligibility criteria, and will inform the Town Councils of the details in a few months' time."
adoption of who suicide prevention strategy,"Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the Ministry is adopting the suicide prevention strategy recommended by WHO and, if so, how has it been adapted for our context; (b) what measures have been taken to reduce the stigma about help-seeking for suicide attempts; and (c) how does the Ministry work with the police to ensure that those arrested for attempting suicide are provided sufficient psychological support especially those who appear mentally unstable.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Singapore adopts a multi-pronged approach to prevent suicide, in line with the recommendations under the WHO Public Health Action for the Prevention of Suicide Framework. Government agencies and stakeholders in the social sectors work together to prevent suicides by promoting upstream prevention, encouraging help seeking, providing support to at-risk groups and offering crisis support.First, in the area of prevention, we seek to build mental resilience in our population and increase public awareness of the importance of good mental well-being. Students in our schools are taught social-emotional skills and coping strategies, as well as how to look out for one another and to seek help from trusted adults if necessary. In the community and at workplaces, Health Promotion Board (HPB) offers programmes to promote mental health literacy. It also conducts workshops to provide our elderly tips on mental wellbeing and resilience.Second, we have various programmes to reduce the stigma about seeking help for mental issues. Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs) such as the Samaritans of Singapore (SOS), have been active in promoting public awareness on suicide prevention. Silver Ribbon (Singapore) is another organisation that has been combating stigma about mental illness. It reaches out to persons who need help in building mental wellness and encourages them to seek early treatment. In addition, IMH also conducts public education programmes in schools and in the community.Third, we have put in place services and programmes to provide support to those identified to be at higher risk. For instance, students identified to be depressed or are at risk of suicide are typically referred to school counsellors, or the Child Guidance Clinic in IMH for more challenging cases. For young persons between 16 and 30 years old, the Community Health Assessment Team (CHAT), located at SCAPE Youth Park, provides a one-stop centre (CHAT Hub) for mental health help and resources. Within the community, Family Service Centres (FSCs) provide counselling and support services to families and individuals with social and emotional difficulties. Senior Activity Centres organise befriending programmes to reach out to elderly persons who live alone in rental flats so as to prevent social isolation and depression.Schools, FSCs and VWOs are in turn supported by the Response, Early Intervention, Assessment in Community mental Health, or REACH, teams set up by IMH. These are multidisciplinary teams that provide training and support to partners so as to strengthen their ability to identify and manage at-risk youths and children and to make appropriate referrals.Fourth, we have services in place for individuals in crisis who need urgent help. SOS operates a 24-hour hotline to counsel persons in distress. IMH also operates a 24-hour Mental Health Helpline manned by counsellors who are trained to de-escalate situations, assess and triage cases, and activate home visit teams quickly if necessary.For cases of attempted suicide, the Police may refer the person to SOS for counselling, or engage the next-of-kin to assist in supporting and caring for the person. If there are clear signs indicating possible mental instability, the Police may refer the person to the IMH for an assessment. The person may be warded at IMH for care and treatment if necessary.The reasons for suicides are often complex and multi-dimensional. Each suicide is one too many. We will continue to improve our inter-agency and multi-prong suicide prevention efforts."
fund allocation to agencies based on qualitative indicators,"Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin asked the Minister for Finance (a) whether the Ministry has explored using qualitative indicators versus quantitative performance indicators to determine how funding is allocated for different agencies; and (b) how has the Ministry worked with the Ministry of Social and Family Development, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth, and Ministry of Education to measure social and cultural impact.","Mr Heng Swee Keat: The Government strives to ensure that public monies are well spent to achieve their intended outcomes. In our evaluation of programmes for funding, we are open to considering all forms of performance indicators that help provide a more holistic assessment of their impact. This includes both qualitative as well as quantitative indicators.While current performance indicators tend to be quantitative in nature, we complement these with qualitative indicators. For example, when looking at public housing, we use both quantitative data, which include home ownership rates and debt servicing ratio for applicants for new flats, and qualitative indicators which include regular surveys of residents on factors such as satisfaction with the living environment. Both quantitative and qualitative indicators are considered to refine our housing policies and programmes, improve town designs and guide how we allocate resources for public housing.Each Ministry is accountable for its respective outcomes. MOF supports each Ministry's work in their development of performance indicators that balance between helping to capture their impact, while not being too onerous to track. These are regularly reported for each Ministry as part of the annual Revenue and Expenditure Estimates released during Budget. In addition, every two years, the Ministry of Finance works with agencies to publish the Singapore Public Sector Outcomes Review (SPOR), which takes stock of Government programmes. This includes social and cultural impact, which is measured through a wide range of indicators such as healthcare affordability, the resilience of families, and the incidence of volunteerism.For instance, to track efforts in strengthening families, the Ministry of Social and Family Development monitors indicators such as social attitudes towards family life from periodic surveys. The Ministry of Education tracks indicators such as the number of students who progress to Secondary and post-Secondary education, and the international ranking of our education system. The Ministry of Health tracks indicators on waiting times, bed occupancy rates and public satisfaction with public hospitals and polyclinics. The Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth monitors volunteerism rates but also qualitative indicators such as the attitudes of youth to helping the less fortunate and contributing to society.We are mindful that not every policy outcome can be tracked by a single set of numbers. While quantitative indicators provide a measurable and comparable basis for evaluation of an agency's programmes, qualitative indicators can provide further insight into outcomes that are difficult to measure. We will continue to seek assessing programmes from multiple dimensions."
trends and penalties for jaywalking,Ms Chia Yong Yong asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether the Government has studied the trends in increased jaywalking; (b) what are the numbers of jaywalkers over the last five years; (c) how many of them have been warned or penalised for jaywalking; and (d) what are the Government's plans to penalise jaywalking and ensure that jaywalking will be brought under control.,"Mr K Shanmugam: To get a sense of the jaywalking situation, the Police monitor two indicators: the numbers of fatal and injury accidents involving pedestrians who jaywalked. In 2011, there were 25 fatal accidents and 292 injury accidents involving jaywalkers. In comparison, in 2015, there were 22 fatal accidents and 208 injury accidents involving jaywalkers.While the numbers of fatal and injury accidents involving jaywalkers have fallen, nevertheless, jaywalking remains an issue we are concerned about.We need both enforcement and education to tackle this issue. The Traffic Police (TP) deploys officers at jaywalking hotspots to enforce against jaywalking and educate pedestrians on safe road use. On average, in the last five years, TP issued about 7,400 warnings or summonses for jaywalking each year.TP regularly engages pedestrians on road safety and good road-use practices, especially the young and elderly, who are more vulnerable. Last year, TP partnered Shell to organise the 35th Shell Traffic Games to educate primary school students on road safety. TP also partnered the Singapore Road Safety Council, Tote Board and Singapore Pools to organise the Road Safety Concert for the Golden Age to educate elderly pedestrians about safe road-use.TP will also be launching another road safety campaign targeting the elderly later this year. The campaign will provide an easy self-test kit for elderly pedestrians to learn more about their visual, hearing and reflex capabilities, and help them better understand themselves and the risks of jaywalking.The Government will continue to implement road safety features for pedestrians. For example, LTA has installed metal barriers along the road or centre divider to discourage jaywalking. LTA will also build more pedestrian crossings to facilitate safe crossing. TP works closely with LTA on the ""Silver Zone"" initiative, which brings senior-friendly road safety features to matured estates with high concentrations of elderly folks. LTA will expand the Green Man Plus Scheme, which allows seniors extra time to cross the road by tapping their senior citizen EZ-Link cards.It is also the pedestrians’ individual responsibility to ensure that they practise good road safety habits, including not jaywalking. We would like to remind pedestrians to always use proper pedestrian crossings, for example, traffic light junctions, zebra crossings, overhead bridges and underpasses. All road users have a part to play in keeping our roads safe. Other road users, including motorists and cyclists, also need to look out for pedestrians."
competition between local retailer and offshore online retail shops,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Trade) (a) how does the Government ensure a level playing field between our local retailers and online shops operated offshore in terms of the goods and services tax due; (b) how does the Ministry regulate such operators and enforce fair trading practices and protection of personal data; and (c) how many cases of online retail fraud have been reported in the past five years.,"Mr Lim Hng Kiang: Goods and services tax (GST) is levied on the import of goods into Singapore. All local businesses and individuals, including consumers making purchases from online shops located offshore, are required to pay GST when the goods are imported into Singapore. The only exception is where the goods are imported via air or post and the value of the goods fall below $400. The concession is given in recognition that the compliance cost could outweigh the GST collection if every import, regardless of value, is subject to GST.The Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act (""CPFTA"") provides the same protection to consumers who make purchases from online retailers or brick-and-mortar shops. This means that actions can be taken against errant online retailers under the CPFTA. SPRING Singapore, as the administering agency for the CPFTA, is empowered with investigation and enforcement powers to take action against errant retailers which persist in unfair practices. The collection, use and disclosure of personal data in Singapore comes under the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA), which is enforced by the Info-Communications Media Development Authority (IMDA). The PDPA is a baseline law that is applicable to all organisations that engage in the collection and processing of personal data in Singapore, regardless of whether they have a physical or online presence.Enforcement of Singapore legislation against online retailers located offshore with no presence in Singapore is challenging. This is a practical jurisdictional issue which is not unique to Singapore. Hence, consumers need to be aware of the risks of purchasing from online retailers located offshore and take extra steps to protect themselves before making their purchases. This could include checking reviews on the reputation of websites and retailers, refund policy and mechanisms, and conditions regarding the use of consumer’s data.In the past five years, the Police have handled an average of 1,000 cases per annum involving online fraud. These usually involve advance payments made to online retailers which subsequently do not deliver the goods."
singaporean co-workers guarantors for foreign nurses,Ms K Thanaletchimi asked the Minister for Health (a) whether Singaporean colleagues of foreign nurses are allowed to be guarantors for them instead of confining this to only their family members before the healthcare institutions grant these foreign nurses sponsorship for further studies; (b) how many cases have there been where the sponsored nurses are unable to complete their studies or become uncontactable after their studies without fulfilling their bond; (c) how much liquidated damages have been paid by guarantors and how many of the affected guarantors are Singaporeans; (d) what level of responsibility should employers bear and what measures are in place to prevent the number of defaults or failures in their course of study; and (e) whether the Ministry will continue its effort and resources to sponsor foreigners to study nursing in Singapore and to what extent.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: A Singaporean colleague of a foreign nurse is allowed to be a guarantor for a foreign nurse pursuing further studies under a sponsorship in the public healthcare sector.Such sponsorships are awarded based on the candidates’ merit, including their performance, potential and commitment to serve in our public healthcare sector. Over the past five years, our public healthcare institutions awarded over 3,600 nursing sponsorships. Four hundred and forty-eight of these sponsorships were awarded to non-Singaporean nurses. Of these, four nurses were unable to complete their studies. Two of them paid liquidated damages and another compensated by serving a bond. Our public healthcare institution is following up on the remaining nurse. Over the past five years, no guarantor was required to pay liquidated damages.Our public healthcare institutions closely monitor the academic performance of all sponsorship recipients. Those who have difficulties meeting the minimum course grades will be given closer supervision. Those who have non-academic issues affecting their training will be provided support and counselling.With an aging population, we will need more nurses to support our growing healthcare needs. Our priority is to continue growing the number of local nurses, and we have stepped up efforts to attract more locals to join nursing. Over the last five years, the total number of local nurses has grown by about 2,700 to about 26,000 in 2015. However, we will still need foreign nurses to supplement our local manpower. Foreign students who are sponsored to undergo nurse training are required to serve a bond in our public healthcare sector upon graduation. We will continue to offer such sponsorships in order to meet our national needs."
action against errant renovation contractors,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (a) how many errant interior renovation contractors have been taken to court over renovation disputes in the past three years; and (b) what regulations are in place to prevent errant contractors from setting up a new company to continue their misdeeds.,"Mr S Iswaran: Renovation disputes may pertain to unfair practices. The Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act (CPFTA) protects consumers against unfair practices by retailers of goods and services, including renovation contractors. The Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) received consumer feedback on about 400 renovation contractors annually from 2013 to September 2016, or about 6% of renovation businesses in Singapore. CASE successfully helped the majority of these consumers to resolve the disputes through negotiation and mediation. CASE did not file any injunction application with the courts against renovation contractors over disputes related to unfair practices under the CPFTA. Separately, about 160 consumer cases filed with the Small Claims Tribunal (SCT) each year were disputes on renovations.CASE has worked with the Singapore Renovation Contractors and Material Suppliers Association (RCMA) on the CaseTrust-RCMA accreditation scheme. Renovation contractors who are CaseTrust-RCMA accredited provide prepayment protection, and offer consumers a CaseTrust standard renovation contract which provides consumers with cost transparency and accountability on deliverables.MTI regularly reviews the CPFTA to ensure that it remains relevant and offers appropriate protection for consumers. The Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) (Amendment) Bill was passed in Parliament on 13 September 2016. The amendments strengthen the measures that may be taken against errant retailers, including renovation contractors, who persist in unfair practices. This includes appointing SPRING Singapore (SPRING) as the administering agency with investigation and enforcement powers, and additional measures that the courts may impose on errant retailers, such as requiring them to publicise injunction orders, and notify SPRING of changes to their employment status and business entities. This enables SPRING to monitor businesses and individuals who are under injunction orders to ensure that they comply with the orders, and SPRING will take timely action against them if they do not. The changes will come into effect by end 2016."
conditions for granting exemptions for mother tongue,"Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Education (Schools) (a) what constitutes ""exceptional circumstances"" in which Mother Tongue (MT) exemptions are granted to schoolchildren with diagnosed special education needs (SEN); and (b) how does the Ministry assess SEN children who are able to compensate for their learning disabilities currently by relying on memory or rote learning instead of comprehension and assimilation of MT but who will face pronounced difficulties in learning MT in the future.","Mr Ng Chee Meng: A student with special education needs may be considered for exemption from Mother Tongue Language (MTL) if he or she has certified Special Educational Needs (SEN) that severely affect his or her ability to cope with learning MTL and with overall learning.In the assessment of severe learning disabilities, one key consideration is how well the child responds to instructions given by the teacher. Regardless of the compensatory approach used, the child’s rate of response to instruction is an important indicator of possible learning disabilities. Children with more severe learning disabilities have been observed to show relatively poor rate of response to instructions, and to have persistent difficulties in learning despite receiving appropriate teaching and intervention.The MTL exemption is given to students with SEN who are not coping well with their overall studies. This is to help reduce their total academic load so that they can cope better with the learning of other subjects. When reviewing applications for MTL exemption from students with SEN, the consideration is not just whether they have diagnosed special needs, but also how they are coping with their overall learning.Students with SEN who are coping with their overall studies but have difficulty with the Standard MTL curriculum, should consider the option of taking MTL at Foundation level, which is less demanding, instead of seeking MTL exemption. The Foundation MTL curriculum at Primary 5 and 6, and the MTL ""B"" curriculum at Secondary and Junior College levels are focused on the development of oral and listening skills and have a much reduced demand on writing skills."
affordability of childcare services since 2008 review,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) how has the affordability of childcare services changed since the last review in 2008; and (b) whether the Ministry will review the basic subsidy of $300 for working mothers.,"Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: Providing affordable and quality childcare services for parents is a key priority for the Government. In the last few years, we have increased the provision of these services through our Anchor Operator (AOP) and Partner Operator (POP) schemes, which now make up almost half of the childcare market.Operators under the AOP and POP schemes are subject to fee caps of $720 and $800 (before GST) respectively, and controls over fee increases. Singaporean children enrolled in POP centres also benefitted from a one-off reduction in fees when the scheme was rolled out in January this year. With these schemes in place, the industry median fee was lowered for the first time in at least a decade, from $900 to $856.In addition, the Government provides childcare subsidies to help defray the fees borne by parents. On top of the basic subsidy of $300 per month for working mothers, lower- and middle-income families who require more help have been offered additional subsidies of up to $440 per month since 2013. For example, a low-income family with a child enrolled in an AOP centre charging $720 (with GST) will only pay the minimum co-payment amount of $3 a month.More recently, the Child Development Account (or CDA) First Step grant was introduced this year. CDA funds can also be used to pay for education and healthcare needs of the child, including childcare fees.The multi-pronged approach of providing quality and affordable services through Anchor and Partner operators, complemented by Government support through the CDA and our childcare subsidy framework, has made childcare more affordable. We will continue to review our policies, including our childcare subsidies, to ensure that quality childcare remains affordable for families."
parallel road to kpe as additional route for motorists travelling between hougang and ubi,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Transport whether LTA will consider (i) building another road parallel to the KPE as an additional route for motorists travelling between Hougang and Ubi and (ii) increasing the speed limit to 90km/h along the stretch of KPE between Buangkok Drive and Defu flyover.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Building more roads to improve traffic speeds is not a sustainable option in land-scarce Singapore. Furthermore, studies based on the experiences of other cities have shown that building more roads only relieves congestion temporarily. Soon, more motorists will be attracted to use the additional roads, making them congested as well.The more sustainable approach is to encourage motorists to switch to public transport, manage traffic demand, and continue to tighten the growth of the vehicle population. We have recently added 15 new trains to increase the capacity of the North-East Line. We will introduce two additional bus services by the end of this year to bring residents living in the Northeast from their homes directly to the city centre. We are also monitoring traffic speeds to see whether there is a need to introduce Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) on the KPE. We reduced the vehicle growth rate to 0.25% from 2015, and will consider whether to bring it to zero at the next review.For safety reasons, we cannot increase the speed limit of the KPE between Buangkok Drive and Defu flyover. The assessment is that this stretch of the KPE does not have sufficient sight distance for motorists to react to traffic or obstacles ahead if they are travelling above 80 kilometres per hour."
police action in hostage case involving two-year-old child in sembawang,Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for Home Affairs with regard to the recent hostage incident where a two-year-old child was held in a 17-hour standoff in Sembawang (a) why did the police not storm into the flat earlier and rescue the child; and (b) what were the considerations before the police decided to act.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The priority of the Police in a hostage situation is to ensure the safety of the hostage, and the people in and around the incident location, such as the public and Home Team officers. Where possible, Police will seek to resolve the incident without any person coming to harm. The tactics employed to achieve this objective would vary according to the incident.I cannot go into the specific operational details for this case. In general, Police will engage the hostage-taker to seek a peaceful resolution, even if it could lead to a prolonged stand-off, such as in this case. There are risks involved for the hostage and people in and around the incident, when a storming operation is carried out. The Police did not storm into the flat earlier as it was assessed that the hostage-taker did not pose any immediate danger to the child if he was not provoked. As a result, the ground decision was taken to de-escalate the situation by deploying the Crisis Negotiation Unit to talk to the hostage-taker to persuade him to surrender.When negotiations were not successful, the Police had to assess the right timing to break into the flat without putting the child at risk. The Police eventually succeeded in rescuing the child, unharmed, and apprehended the hostage-taker. No one was injured in the operation."
tighter regulation of home renovation contractors,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether there are plans for greater regulation of home renovation contractors to have a minimum entry level for such contractors; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider requiring such companies to post a bond before they are allowed registration with HDB or BCA.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: BCA regulates construction works to ensure the structural safety of buildings under the Building Control Act. HDB requires renovation contractors to be registered under the Registered Renovation Contractors Scheme (RRCS) to ensure that renovation works in HDB flats do not affect the structural integrity of the building. Under HDB's RRCS, renovation contractors must:a. Have a minimum paid-up capital of $30,000 if they are a private-limited company;b. Be registered with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority;c. Should have at least three years of experience in renovation works;d. Attend the training course on ""Renovation for Public Housing"" so that they are familiar with the rules and regulations in renovating HDB flats.However, both BCA and HDB do not regulate the quality and schedule of renovation works. These are contractual issues between the contractor and their client. Home owners should consider engaging renovation contractors who are accredited under the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) and/or renovation contractors' associations. One such example is the joint accreditation scheme between CASE and the Singapore Renovation Contractors and Material Suppliers Association (RCMA). Contractors accredited under this scheme are required to post a performance bond to cover disputes arising from non-performance of the renovation contractor."
possibility of dual citizenship for singaporeans,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai asked the Minister for Home Affairs what are the reasons for not allowing Singaporean citizens to hold dual citizenships and whether the time is now right to review the relevant rules.,"Mr K Shanmugam: Singapore does not allow dual citizenship. We are a small and young nation and it is important that our citizens have a long-term commitment to building a future together.Singaporeans enjoy rights and privileges as citizens, and are expected to uphold the duties and responsibilities that come with citizenship. Allowing Singaporeans to retain or acquire a second citizenship is unlikely to enhance that commitment, but could instead dilute it."
"safety measures for rides at fun fairs, carnivals and theme parks","Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for National Development what measures are in place to ensure the safety of amusement rides including those at fun fairs, carnivals and theme parks and how often are safety enforcement and spot checks by qualified inspectors performed.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Amusement rides in Singapore are regulated under the Amusement Rides Safety Act (ARSA) administered by BCA. Under this regulatory framework, permits are required for the installation, modification and operation of amusement rides. Regular maintenance and inspections are also required. This framework ensures that rides are designed, maintained and operated according to internationally recognised safety codes and standards.For the installation of new rides and for major modifications to existing rides, a Qualified Person has to be appointed to review and certify the plans and safety assessments based on the technical codes. The Qualified Person must be a Specialist Professional Engineer registered with the Professional Engineers Board in the discipline of Amusement Rides Engineering.The ride operator oversees the safety of ride operations. Among other requirements, the ride operator needs to appoint a Ride Manager to manage and supervise the daily operation and routine maintenance of the ride. For example, the Ride Manager needs to ensure a thorough inspection before opening the ride for public use each day, and that only persons trained to operate the ride can do so.In addition, amusement rides are required to undergo annual inspections and certifications by a Qualified Person. For major rides, the Qualified Person carrying out the inspection will need to be advised by a Conformity Assessor – a third party technical expert in assessing amusement rides.BCA also conducts inspections on the operation and maintenance of the rides. In 2015, BCA conducted about 300 inspections on the 110 rides in Singapore. If safety issues are detected, BCA will take enforcement action such as suspending the operations.We will continue to work closely with the industry to ensure that our amusement rides are designed, maintained, and operated according to prescribed safety standards. Ride users can also play a part in creating a safe and fun experience for themselves by adhering to the ride safety guidelines."
ramps for hdb flats with steps at entrances,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the number of HDB flats that have multiple steps at the flats' entrance; (b) whether HDB has plans to install ramps for such flats at a subsidised cost to residents who need it for easier accessibility; and (c) when will be the estimated earliest time that ramps can be installed for such flats in view of the ageing population.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Some older HDB flats built in the 1970s and 1980s were designed with multi-step entrances to offer more privacy and added security for occupants of the flats. HDB estimates that there are more than 100,000 of such units. With an ageing population, elderly residents and wheelchair users living in these flats may now face difficulties negotiating the steps. HDB has been carefully studying this issue.There are challenges in implementing a common solution across blocks of different configurations. Any solution will likely have to be customised to the flat configuration, corridor space availability and the residents' needs, without posing maintenance issues or obstructing the fire escape route.When we have developed the appropriate solutions, we could implement them as an expansion of Enhancement for Active Seniors (EASE) or through other programmes. HDB is also exploring with other agencies the options for financial assistance that could be provided for low income families who may need such ramps or platforms.Meanwhile, residents who wish to engage a private vendor to install customised ramps today can approach the HDB Branches. HDB is working towards offering a one-stop application service for residents by coordinating the application with the relevant regulatory agencies. This will make it easier for residents to install such ramps. Residents who need financial help for the ramp installation may also approach VWOs or their Advisers for assistance."
temporary centre for hawkers affected by fire at jurong west market and coffeeshop,"Mr Ang Wei Neng asked the Minister for National Development with regard to the Jurong West market and coffeeshop which have been affected by a recent fire, whether HDB can consider funding, fully or partially, the building of a temporary market/ hawker centre while waiting for the completion of the permanent building.","Mr Lawrence Wong: In the event of a fire to HDB markets and eating houses which renders the premises unfit for use, HDB’s priority is to rebuild the replacement premises as soon as possible. This is to minimise the impact on the affected stallholders, and facilitate the return to normalcy for their business operations as soon as possible. HDB will bear the full cost of building the replacement premises.In the interim, HDB and other government agencies have provided immediate assistance and coordinated for help to be extended to the affected stallholders of Jurong West market. For instance, HDB has waived the rental for the operator of the market during the interim period when the replacement premises are being built. The Temporary Occupation License (or TOL) fees for the State Land on which the temporary market will be built, will also be waived In addition, NEA has offered the affected stallholders available market and food stalls where they can conduct their businesses in the interim. More recently, the People’s Association and the Employment and Employability Institute (e2i) have held a job fair to assist the stallholders in finding alternative employment.These measures complement the commendable efforts of the Adviser, grassroots leaders and community in raising funds for the construction of the temporary market. We will continue to monitor the situation, and provide further assistance to the stall holders where needed."
lifts for private buildings more than three storeys in height,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the number of private buildings above three storeys that do not have lifts installed; and (b) whether there are plans to ensure or encourage owners of such private buildings to install lifts for easier accessibility by the elderly and less able-bodied.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Currently, our Building Control Regulations require buildings of five storeys or more to be provided with passenger lifts. Lift provision is not mandatory for buildings under five storeys. Hence, about 370 existing low rise commercial and institutional buildings do not have lifts installed.To nudge private building owners to voluntarily upgrade their buildings, BCA provides incentives via the $40-million Accessibility Fund. The Fund co-pays up to 80% of the construction costs for lift provision, capped at $300,000 per development. To date, the Fund has supported lift installations in 79 developments. We have recently extended the availability of the Fund until March 2022."
adoption of who suicide prevention strategy,"Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the Ministry is adopting the suicide prevention strategy recommended by WHO and, if so, how has it been adapted for our context; (b) what measures have been taken to reduce the stigma about help-seeking for suicide attempts; and (c) how does the Ministry work with the police to ensure that those arrested for attempting suicide are provided sufficient psychological support especially those who appear mentally unstable.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Singapore adopts a multi-pronged approach to prevent suicide, in line with the recommendations under the WHO Public Health Action for the Prevention of Suicide Framework. Government agencies and stakeholders in the social sectors work together to prevent suicides by promoting upstream prevention, encouraging help seeking, providing support to at-risk groups and offering crisis support.First, in the area of prevention, we seek to build mental resilience in our population and increase public awareness of the importance of good mental well-being. Students in our schools are taught social-emotional skills and coping strategies, as well as how to look out for one another and to seek help from trusted adults if necessary. In the community and at workplaces, Health Promotion Board (HPB) offers programmes to promote mental health literacy. It also conducts workshops to provide our elderly tips on mental wellbeing and resilience.Second, we have various programmes to reduce the stigma about seeking help for mental issues. Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs) such as the Samaritans of Singapore (SOS), have been active in promoting public awareness on suicide prevention. Silver Ribbon (Singapore) is another organisation that has been combating stigma about mental illness. It reaches out to persons who need help in building mental wellness and encourages them to seek early treatment. In addition, IMH also conducts public education programmes in schools and in the community.Third, we have put in place services and programmes to provide support to those identified to be at higher risk. For instance, students identified to be depressed or are at risk of suicide are typically referred to school counsellors, or the Child Guidance Clinic in IMH for more challenging cases. For young persons between 16 and 30 years old, the Community Health Assessment Team (CHAT), located at SCAPE Youth Park, provides a one-stop centre (CHAT Hub) for mental health help and resources. Within the community, Family Service Centres (FSCs) provide counselling and support services to families and individuals with social and emotional difficulties. Senior Activity Centres organise befriending programmes to reach out to elderly persons who live alone in rental flats so as to prevent social isolation and depression.Schools, FSCs and VWOs are in turn supported by the Response, Early Intervention, Assessment in Community mental Health, or REACH, teams set up by IMH. These are multidisciplinary teams that provide training and support to partners so as to strengthen their ability to identify and manage at-risk youths and children and to make appropriate referrals.Fourth, we have services in place for individuals in crisis who need urgent help. SOS operates a 24-hour hotline to counsel persons in distress. IMH also operates a 24-hour Mental Health Helpline manned by counsellors who are trained to de-escalate situations, assess and triage cases, and activate home visit teams quickly if necessary.For cases of attempted suicide, the Police may refer the person to SOS for counselling, or engage the next-of-kin to assist in supporting and caring for the person. If there are clear signs indicating possible mental instability, the Police may refer the person to the IMH for an assessment. The person may be warded at IMH for care and treatment if necessary.The reasons for suicides are often complex and multi-dimensional. Each suicide is one too many. We will continue to improve our inter-agency and multi-prong suicide prevention efforts."
fund allocation to agencies based on qualitative indicators,"Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin asked the Minister for Finance (a) whether the Ministry has explored using qualitative indicators versus quantitative performance indicators to determine how funding is allocated for different agencies; and (b) how has the Ministry worked with the Ministry of Social and Family Development, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth, and Ministry of Education to measure social and cultural impact.","Mr Heng Swee Keat: The Government strives to ensure that public monies are well spent to achieve their intended outcomes. In our evaluation of programmes for funding, we are open to considering all forms of performance indicators that help provide a more holistic assessment of their impact. This includes both qualitative as well as quantitative indicators.While current performance indicators tend to be quantitative in nature, we complement these with qualitative indicators. For example, when looking at public housing, we use both quantitative data, which include home ownership rates and debt servicing ratio for applicants for new flats, and qualitative indicators which include regular surveys of residents on factors such as satisfaction with the living environment. Both quantitative and qualitative indicators are considered to refine our housing policies and programmes, improve town designs and guide how we allocate resources for public housing.Each Ministry is accountable for its respective outcomes. MOF supports each Ministry's work in their development of performance indicators that balance between helping to capture their impact, while not being too onerous to track. These are regularly reported for each Ministry as part of the annual Revenue and Expenditure Estimates released during Budget. In addition, every two years, the Ministry of Finance works with agencies to publish the Singapore Public Sector Outcomes Review (SPOR), which takes stock of Government programmes. This includes social and cultural impact, which is measured through a wide range of indicators such as healthcare affordability, the resilience of families, and the incidence of volunteerism.For instance, to track efforts in strengthening families, the Ministry of Social and Family Development monitors indicators such as social attitudes towards family life from periodic surveys. The Ministry of Education tracks indicators such as the number of students who progress to Secondary and post-Secondary education, and the international ranking of our education system. The Ministry of Health tracks indicators on waiting times, bed occupancy rates and public satisfaction with public hospitals and polyclinics. The Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth monitors volunteerism rates but also qualitative indicators such as the attitudes of youth to helping the less fortunate and contributing to society.We are mindful that not every policy outcome can be tracked by a single set of numbers. While quantitative indicators provide a measurable and comparable basis for evaluation of an agency's programmes, qualitative indicators can provide further insight into outcomes that are difficult to measure. We will continue to seek assessing programmes from multiple dimensions."
trends and penalties for jaywalking,Ms Chia Yong Yong asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether the Government has studied the trends in increased jaywalking; (b) what are the numbers of jaywalkers over the last five years; (c) how many of them have been warned or penalised for jaywalking; and (d) what are the Government's plans to penalise jaywalking and ensure that jaywalking will be brought under control.,"Mr K Shanmugam: To get a sense of the jaywalking situation, the Police monitor two indicators: the numbers of fatal and injury accidents involving pedestrians who jaywalked. In 2011, there were 25 fatal accidents and 292 injury accidents involving jaywalkers. In comparison, in 2015, there were 22 fatal accidents and 208 injury accidents involving jaywalkers.While the numbers of fatal and injury accidents involving jaywalkers have fallen, nevertheless, jaywalking remains an issue we are concerned about.We need both enforcement and education to tackle this issue. The Traffic Police (TP) deploys officers at jaywalking hotspots to enforce against jaywalking and educate pedestrians on safe road use. On average, in the last five years, TP issued about 7,400 warnings or summonses for jaywalking each year.TP regularly engages pedestrians on road safety and good road-use practices, especially the young and elderly, who are more vulnerable. Last year, TP partnered Shell to organise the 35th Shell Traffic Games to educate primary school students on road safety. TP also partnered the Singapore Road Safety Council, Tote Board and Singapore Pools to organise the Road Safety Concert for the Golden Age to educate elderly pedestrians about safe road-use.TP will also be launching another road safety campaign targeting the elderly later this year. The campaign will provide an easy self-test kit for elderly pedestrians to learn more about their visual, hearing and reflex capabilities, and help them better understand themselves and the risks of jaywalking.The Government will continue to implement road safety features for pedestrians. For example, LTA has installed metal barriers along the road or centre divider to discourage jaywalking. LTA will also build more pedestrian crossings to facilitate safe crossing. TP works closely with LTA on the ""Silver Zone"" initiative, which brings senior-friendly road safety features to matured estates with high concentrations of elderly folks. LTA will expand the Green Man Plus Scheme, which allows seniors extra time to cross the road by tapping their senior citizen EZ-Link cards.It is also the pedestrians’ individual responsibility to ensure that they practise good road safety habits, including not jaywalking. We would like to remind pedestrians to always use proper pedestrian crossings, for example, traffic light junctions, zebra crossings, overhead bridges and underpasses. All road users have a part to play in keeping our roads safe. Other road users, including motorists and cyclists, also need to look out for pedestrians."
unsolved hit-and-run traffic accidents,"Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) to date, how many hit-and-run traffic cases remain unsolved; (b) whether the Ministry has an information network which includes workshops to report on suspicious damaged vehicles and immigration officers to do the same for vehicles leaving Singapore; and (c) what other measures are in place to apprehend drivers on the run.","Mr K Shanmugam: Since 2015, there were a total of 233 hit-and-run accidents involving injuries and seven involving fatalities. About one-third of those involving injuries, which comprise the bulk of such accidents, have been solved. Of the seven fatal hit-and-run accidents, all but one have been solved.As part of investigations into such accidents, the Traffic Police (TP) will examine all available forensic evidence as well as camera footage from the accident scene and its vicinity. TP will also appeal for witnesses through multiple platforms such as displaying witness appeal signs at the accident location and broadcasting appeal notices via mainstream and social media. Once the identity of the offender or vehicle is established, TP will spare no effort to bring the offender to task.TP also work through various partners like the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA), the insurance and motor workshop industries to locate the vehicles. TP obtain accident information, including the damage to the vehicles, from the General Insurance Association. TP will also engage motor workshops as part of its investigations.We take a tough stance against motorists who flee from an accident scene. All motorists must stop when they are involved in an accident and render aid to the victim. Severe penalties are meted out to hit-and-run offenders to deter motorists from fleeing from the accident scene. Offender can be fined up to $3,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to a year. The offender will also be disqualified for driving for at least a year. These charges are in addition to charges under the Penal Code if death or hurt were caused in the accident."
mandatory insurance coverage for contract workers,"Ms Chia Yong Yong asked the Minister for Manpower whether there are any plans to protect contract workers with mandatory insurance cover to be purchased by companies contracting their services, particularly health, personal accident and life insurance.","Mr Lim Swee Say: Contract workers can be under ""contracts of service"" or ""contracts for service"". A contract of service is defined by an agreement between an employer and an employee which includes the terms and conditions of employment. In a contract for service, an independent contractor, such as a self-employed person or a freelancer, is engaged for a fee to carry out an assignment or project.All local employees who are under contracts of service are entitled to have medical benefits through mandatory employer and employee Medisave contributions. Employees can use these Medisave contributions to pay for MediShield Life and Integrated Shield Plans premiums. In addition, all employees are also eligible under the Work Injury Compensation Act for work injury compensation if they are injured at work or if they contract an occupational disease.Companies who contract services from self-employed individuals under contracts for service are not required to buy insurance for these individuals. This is because there is no employer-employee relationship between them. Nonetheless, self-employed persons are required to contribute to their CPF Medisave accounts if they earn an annual net trade income of more than $6,000. These contributions can likewise be used to pay premiums for MediShield Life and Integrated Shield Plans.Contract workers who are under contracts of service can contact MOM for assistance if they are not provided with statutory benefits that they are entitled to."
wage differential of ex-offender placed in a job through score,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Home Affairs in the last five years (a) what is the average wage differential of an ex-offender who secures employment through the Singapore Corporation of Rehabilitative Enterprises (SCORE) compared to the median industry wage in the relevant industries; and (b) what is the number of white collar or office-based jobs that SCORE has matched ex-offenders to.,"Mr K Shanmugam: Based on the employment facilitated by SCORE in 2015, the median salary of ex-offenders was on average about 10% lower than the median salary for similar occupations in the market.Of the 2,157 inmates assisted by SCORE in 2015, 1% (or 30) were matched to white-collar jobs. This figure has been fairly consistent over the last five years.The employers' support for the acceptance and fair employment of ex-offenders is key in helping them rebuild their lives. As ex-offenders make the effort to turn over a new leaf, we hope that society, including employers and the community, will stand ready to support them."
"enhancing home-based care options for young children, elderly and disabled","Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling asked the Minister for Social and Family Development what are the plans or considerations for enhancing home-based care options for young children, seniors and the disabled.","Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: The family plays a critical role in the care of young children, seniors and the disabled. Family members not only provide physical care, but are also an important source of emotional support and love. The Government recognises this, and has put in place a comprehensive suite of support schemes and initiatives to help families care for their loved ones within the home environment.To support parents in caring for and bonding with their newborns, the Government has been progressively enhancing parental leave provisions, such as maternity, paternity, and shared parental leave over the years. From January 2017, the second week of paternity leave will be mandatory, and from July 2017, shared parental leave will be increased from 1 to 4 weeks.To further support parents with their caregiving expenses, which may include expenses for home-based care, the Baby Bonus Cash Gift was enhanced last year with the Baby Bonus Plus of $2,000.The Government has also stepped up efforts to support families in caring for their seniors at home. In the past five years, we have made care more accessible by expanding home-based care capacity, which includes services such as home visits by doctors and nurses, from 3,800 places to 6,900 places. We have also increased centre-based care capacity from 2,100 day places to 3,500 day places, and are growing these capacities further to 10,000 home places and 6,200 day places respectively by 2020.MOH has also launched a Home & Community Care Masterplan to enable seniors to grow old at home. Initiatives under the plan include (i) training and assessing a new ""corps"" of domestic eldercarers so that they can anchor good care for seniors at home, (ii) expanding community befriending programmes to strengthen the support network for seniors and their families, (iii) piloting a new model of care that provides home and centre-based care flexibly to meet seniors' needs more holistically; and (iv) investing in research and innovation to pioneer new and better ways of caring for our seniors at home.The Government further supports caregivers of seniors by putting in place respite services, and defraying caregiving costs through schemes such as Caregiver Training Grant and Seniors' Mobility and Enabling Fund.Caregivers of loved ones with disabilities can develop or enhance their care skills with the support of the Caregivers’ Training Grant. They can also approach caregiver support centres at Voluntary Welfare Organisations and Special Education schools. In addition, the Government has started a pilot on Home-Based Care Services for Persons with Disabilities aged 16 and above. The pilot provides therapy, personal hygiene care, house-keeping and medication reminder services, to enable Persons with Disabilities to live in their own home, with family, friends and neighbours in the community, and to support their caregivers in the provision of care.Caregivers requiring the assistance of a Foreign Domestic Worker to care for young children, seniors, or their loved ones with disability are eligible to pay a lower monthly levy as well. They pay a concessionary levy rate of $60 per month, which is $205 less than usual. Those caring for the elderly and Persons with Disabilities at home, whose monthly per capita income is less than $2,600, are also supported through a monthly grant which offsets the cost of hiring a foreign domestic worker.The family is the first and most important line of support. The Government remains committed to support families to care for their loved ones within the home environment."
subsidies for immunisations for children and elderly,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry will consider extending the full subsidies for compulsory childhood immunisations recommended under the National Childhood Immunisation Programme for all children who are Singapore citizens at private GP clinics.,"38 Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry will consider providing free immunisations against influenza, T-dap, pneumococcal pneumonia (both Pneumo23 and Pneumo13) and herpes zoster infections for elderly Singaporeans.Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Ministry of Health (MOH) is guided by the Expert Committee on Immunisation (ECI)'s recommendations, in deciding on the use of Medisave and provision of subsidies. Medisave use is allowed for all recommended vaccinations. We also provide full subsidies at the polyclinics for children who are Singaporean citizens for vaccines that are recommended for preventing disease outbreaks in the community, such as the compulsory childhood vaccinations for measles and diphtheria.Medisave can be used for influenza and Pneumo23 vaccines recommended for high-risk groups, such as the elderly and suffering from chronic diseases. Based on the ECI's advice in August 2016, MOH is reviewing the use of Medisave for the Pneumo13 vaccine.In addition, subsidies for influenza have been extended to Singaporeans who are subsidised residents in nursing homes. The ECI does not recommend diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus and herpes zoster vaccinations for the elderly.Currently, every Singapore citizen baby receives a $4,000 government grant in their Medisave accounts. This grant can be used for medical expenses, and all vaccinations under the National Childhood Immunisation Schedule (NCIS). There are also other government measures, such as the Baby Bonus scheme, which can also be used for NCIS vaccinations, including at accredited private GP and paediatrician clinics. Through Medisave and the Baby Bonus, the cost of these vaccinations are thus fully supported by Government even at private clinics.MOH will continue to review our vaccination policies based on professional inputs from the ECI, to ensure accessibility and affordability for Singaporeans."
success rate of applicants getting bto flats under married child priority scheme,"Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for National Development (a) since the Married Child Priority Scheme (MCPS) was launched, how many buyers who applied for a BTO flat under the Scheme have been successful and unsuccessful in getting a flat respectively; and (b) whether there is sufficient help for buyers to live near their parents for mutual care and support.","Mr Lawrence Wong: The current quota-based Married Child Priority Scheme (MCPS) was implemented in end-2014. In 2015, about 1,600 applications for BTO flats in non-mature estates made under MCPS were successful. This translates to a success rate of about 85%. The success rate for BTO flats in mature estates under MCPS is lower at about 47%, given the high demand for and limited supply of such flats. Nonetheless, the success rates for MCPS applicants in both mature and non-mature estates are still higher than that for public applicants.Helping families live near one another for mutual care and support has been a longstanding priority for the Government. Today, we set aside up to 45% of the public flat supply for MCPS applicants. If the demand still outstrips supply under the MCPS quota, unsuccessful MCPS applicants will also have another chance to ballot for a new flat with other public applicants.Besides MCPS, HDB also has other schemes and policies to help families live with or near one another. These includei) The Multi-Generation Priority Scheme, which gives priority to parents and married child who jointly apply for the same BTO project;ii) The Three-Generation (3Gen) flats, which are purpose-built to cater to multi-generation living under one roof;iii) Allowing parents or married child who are buying a resale flat to live with or near each other, to benefit from the Proximity Housing Grant of $20,000; andiv) Setting the income ceiling for subsidised housing at a higher level for extended families who are buying a flat to live together."
professional skills training elements in skillsfuture courses,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling asked the Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (a) what percentage of existing SkillsFuture courses has elements associated with professional skills training; (b) whether customisation of courses is allowed to cater to the needs of different industries; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider a SkillsFuture package tailored for women planning to transit back to the workforce to enable them to have skills that are relevant to current market demand.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: There is a wide range of skills-based courses that are eligible for the SkillsFuture Credit. As of 31 July 2016, there are over 15,000 courses listed in the SkillsFuture Credit directory. When including courses, we ensure they are skills-based, i.e. they must be professionally useful to the trainee, depending on their vocational needs.Today, the SkillsFuture Credit course directory lists courses in over 50 areas of training. These cover the key sectors of our economy. SSG is continually working with public agencies and professional bodies to include more courses into the SkillsFuture Credit course directory, so as to cater to industry demand and individuals' skills training needs.Various segments, such as retrenched PMETs, older workers, or women, will need additional support. The challenge is not the lack of training courses for them, but having effective guidance. For example, a back-to-work woman may need to sharpen her language skills, be comfortable with using IT, and learn service or manufacturing skills, before going back to work. The courses are all there, but she will need the advice, and must have a positive mind-set."
improving employment opportunities for recent graduates,Ms Sun Xueling asked the Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (a) whether recent graduates who are seeking employment can leverage on the universities' resources to seek internships and market exposure opportunities; and (b) whether there is a central database maintained by public agencies or institutions of higher learning for which young graduates can have access to for internship opportunities.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: Internships are important in allowing students to apply their knowledge and skills in a realistic work environment, facilitate their transition into the workplace upon graduation, and enhance their chances of finding suitable employment after graduation.Therefore, the Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) facilitate opportunities for as many students as possible to take on internships before they graduate.Autonomous Universities (AUs), such as the Singapore Management University (SMU), Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), and Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT), require students to complete internships before they can graduate. National University of Singapore (NUS) and the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) actively facilitate internships but do not make it a requirement for all students.However, they do not facilitate internships for graduates as internships are part of the education process for undergraduates.Our AUs also provide career services to fresh graduates. Examples of their services include personalised career counselling, industry networking events and professional development workshops."
ownership of hdb flats of deceased singaporeans with foreign spouses and children,"Mr Darryl David asked the Minister for National Development what happens to HDB flats that belong to (i) a Singaporean with a foreign spouse who is not a PR or citizen should the Singaporean spouse pass away and (ii) a Singaporean with a foreign spouse who is not a PR or citizen who has Singaporean children who are minors, should the Singaporean spouse pass away.","Mr Lawrence Wong: A non-citizen spouse can retain the flat following the demise of the Singaporean spouse-owner if he/she becomes a Singaporean or permanent resident (PR) within a one-year period, or if he/she includes a Singaporean or PR family member who is at least 21 and satisfies the eligibility rules and conditions to own a flat.If the non-citizen widow or widower has Singaporean children who are minors, HDB can consider exercising flexibility, on a case-by-case basis, for the flat to be held in trust by a Singaporean or PR trustee, on the condition that the flat is to be given to the Singaporean children when they reach 21 years old."
employment rate of graduates of special education schools,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Acting Minister for Education (Schools) (a) what is the current employment rate of graduates of special education schools; and (b) what are the efforts to help special needs Singaporeans to find employment.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: Each year, about 300 students graduate from the SPED schools. Due to the diverse range of disability profiles, these students have different degrees of readiness for work or further studies. About one in three move on to regular employment in a wide range of industries, including Retail, Hospitality, Medical Services, and Food & Beverage. About half move on to sheltered workshops or day activity and care centres. About 10% move on to further studies.A proactive, whole-of-government approach is adopted in helping students and persons with disabilities gain employment in order to live independently and be integrated in society.MOE has put in place various measures to better prepare students in SPED schools for employment.a. A Framework for Vocational Education guides SPED schools to develop a structured curriculum to equip students with life skills and work habits to be employable. This includes participation in authentic and structured work experience.b. Students who obtained either the ITE Skills Certification at Metta School or Workforce Skills Qualification at Delta Senior School may apply for jobs in the open market or attend further training as long as they meet the pre-requisites for the courses, eg, the National ITE Certificate.Persons with disabilities can seek employment assistance and training opportunities from SG Enable.In 2014, MOE collaborated with MSF and SG Enable to develop the School-to-Work (S2W) Transition Programme for students who have potential for work but may not benefit from the certification programmes. The programme begins in the student's final year of schooling and continues for up to one year after he/she graduates. This allows SG Enable to work with students and their families in the final schooling year to place students in appropriate jobs or job training pathways based on their interests, strengths and preferences. After they graduate, students receive customised job training, including structured internships with support from Job Coaches, to prepare them for eventual employment.SG Enable also provides internship opportunities for special needs students in tertiary institutions.Employers may approach SG Enable for advice on, and support for, employing persons with disabilities. They can use the Open Door Programme for funding job redesign, workplace modification and training; and can also benefit from the Special Employment Credit when they hire persons with disabilities to offset cost of wages."
improving diagnosis and treatment of dementia,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Health (a) what measures will be implemented to improve the diagnosis and treatment of dementia; (b) whether there is capacity to provide palliative care in dementia treatment; and (c) what support is available to the families of dementia patients.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Dementia is a term used to describe the symptoms and clinical features reflecting the gradual deterioration in cognitive ability.Early and accurate diagnosis is key to good management of dementia. MOH has been expanding the capacity of memory clinics in our public hospitals to provide early diagnosis and management for dementia patients. Between 2011 and 2016, the number of attendances in our memory clinics increased from about 7,500 attendances to more than 13,000 attendances. In addition, through staff training and reconfiguration of wards, public hospitals are better equipped to care for general patients who also have dementia. Public hospitals also collaborate with primary care providers through joint consultations and case discussions to support persons with dementia.MOH also supports persons with dementia and their families in the community through various ways. First, we are enhancing community support and raising dementia awareness through initiatives such as public education campaigns, dementia resource toolkits and community resource, engagement and support teams (CREST teams). Second, we are strengthening the capability of care staff and caregivers in supporting those with dementia. Between 2013 and 2015 for example, AIC offered over 2,400 training places in dementia-related courses and talks. AIC also provides a Caregivers' Training Grant to caregivers, including foreign domestic workers, to attend many of such courses. Finally, we are expanding community-based and home-based dementia care services. We aim to increase the number of dementia day care services by three-folds to 3,000 places by 2020.We recognise the importance of expanding palliative care for those who have advanced dementia. For example, Assisi Hospice’s new development, which is supported by MOH, will have a dedicated inpatient hospice ward for persons with advanced dementia. Dover Park Hospice and Tan Tock Seng Hospital have piloted a new dedicated home palliative care service called ""Programme Dignity"" for persons with dementia. We will continue to expand these services to meet the increasing need in the future."
transparency in criteria for obtaining permanent residency and citizenship,"Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what are the policy reasons for keeping the criteria for obtaining permanent residency and citizenship opaque and whether there are plans to make them more transparent over time; and (b) what are the circumstantial reasons that justify qualifying a child (under the age of 21) for PR or citizenship while his foreign-born parent, especially those who are the child's single care-giver, is denied similar recognition.","Mr K Shanmugam: Each application for Permanent Residency (PR) and Singapore Citizenship (SC) is evaluated holistically on a range of criteria, including economic contributions, education qualifications, family profile and length of stay in Singapore. The objective is to assess how committed the applicant is to sink roots here, and how well the applicant is able to contribute and integrate into our society.However, we do not reveal the detailed criteria for granting PR and SC as it is not in our interest to do so. Revealing the detailed criteria would, among other things, create sensitivities in their countries of origin.For child applicants, there may be instances where a child is granted SC but not the foreign parent. For example, a child born to a foreign parent who is legally married to an SC at the time of his birth would be entitled to the grant of SC under our Constitution.However, the foreign parent is not entitled to SC in the same manner and would need to meet prevailing criteria to qualify for PR or SC. In such cases, we would not deny the child the grant of SC, even if his foreign parent does not yet meet the prevailing criteria for PR or SC.Foreign spouses who do not qualify for PR or SC may be granted a Long-Term Visit Pass (LTVP) or Long-Term Visit Pass-Plus (LTVP+) for them to remain in Singapore with their families. For foreign parents who are widowed or divorced and have sole custody of young SC children, we would generally facilitate their continued stay in Singapore through a renewable LTVP or LTVP+, to allow them to care for their children here."
reducing pay-tv rates with content reduction,Mr Yee Chia Hsing asked the Minister for Communications and Information whether the Ministry can consider requiring pay-TV service providers to reduce their subscription charges on a pro-rata basis when the TV programming content is reduced as consumers may have subscribed to pay-TV services that are bundled with mobile and internet access and the option to cancel pay-TV services alone may not result in savings.,"Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim: When reviewing consumer protection measures last year, MDA had considered having pay-TV operators reduce their subscription charges on a pro-rata basis when certain channels in a subscription bundle are no longer provided. After getting views from stakeholders on this proposal through a public consultation, MDA decided not to proceed with it.The value of a channel or a programme within a bundle can be subjective, and vary from consumer to consumer. Also, pay-TV operators may offer other similar channels in place of the discontinued ones. During our focused group discussions, consumers provided feedback to MDA that instead of reducing charges on a pro-rata basis, they prefer to be given the option to exit without early termination charges.After careful consideration, MDA decided not to proceed with the proposal. To protect the interests of pay-TV subscribers, MDA introduced other measures in April 2016. These include allowing subscribers to exit their contracts without early termination charges when the pay-TV operators (a) raise subscription prices; (b) remove a material channel or sports content; or (c) remove 20% or more of the total number of channels subscribed. To retain their subscribers, pay-TV operators would need to take mitigating actions when they make these changes, including offering rebates on subscription fees.We believe this is a better way to safeguard consumers’ interests, while allowing the industry to innovate and remain commercially viable."
security lapse in case where nsman took individual physical proficiency test on behalf of another,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Defence with regard to the recent case where an NSman took the Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT) on behalf of another NSman (a) how did he gain entry into the camp and whether there was a security lapse; and (b) whether a review was carried out to tighten the security following this incident.,"Dr Ng Eng Hen: MINDEF takes a serious view of this case. Cheating goes against the core values of the SAF. Every serviceman is expected to uphold a high standard of integrity and those caught cheating in the IPPT are punished. While IPPT is an individual responsibility, SAF commanders must lead by example and their units shoulder the collective responsibility to maintain fitness and performance. Officers and warrant officers caught cheating are no longer fit to command and can have their ranks removed.In the cases involving cheating of IPPT, the NSmen had handed over their identity card to the impersonator to use to enter the camp and take the IPPT. Facial checks are conducted at entry points by sentry guards, but subject to human error especially when large numbers are processed during IPPT sessions. The SAF acknowledges this lapse and verification measures have since been stepped up at the camp gate, and IPPT registration counter and stations.But the more secure system is to utilise technology to reduce human error. To strengthen security of entry into SAF camps, biometric fingerprinting has been progressively introduced since 2015. By 2018, all personnel including NSmen taking their IPPT there will be required to undergo Biometric Fingerprinting to enter into SAF camps."
cost increase to employers for mandatory corporate medical insurance,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Health what is the estimated cost increase to employers and the impact on the Budget (as a result of associated tax benefits) involved in making portable corporate medical insurance mandatory.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: With MediShield Life implemented in November 2015, all Singaporeans now have portable medical insurance. MediShield Life is a basic health insurance scheme that covers all Singaporeans and for all pre-existing illnesses, regardless of any change of employment status or employer. It provides sufficient coverage for subsidised treatment in public hospitals.Today, many employers also extend medical benefits to their employees voluntarily as part of their employment contracts. MOM and tripartite partners encourage employers to structure these benefits on a portable basis and the Government provides incentives for employers to do so, by offering higher tax deductions for medical expenses of up to 2% of total employees’ remuneration.Portable medical benefits can take different forms, such as additional contributions to the employee’s Medisave account, which the employee can use for his healthcare expenses or insurance premiums for MediShield Life or Integrated Shield Plans even if he changes his job. Alternatively, employers may choose to pay for their employees' health insurance premiums directly.MediShield Life is the mandatory, portable health insurance for all Singaporeans, covering them at all stages of life. Employers are already required to make mandatory contributions to their employees’ Medisave to help pay for the premiums of MediShield Life. MOH's focus will be to ensure that MediShield Life continues to meet the needs of Singaporeans."
cultivating inclusive environment in schools for special needs students,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Acting Minister for Education (Schools) (a) beyond having the assistance of allied educators, how does the Ministry ensure that all mainstream schools provide a suitable and inclusive environment for their special needs students where all students can learn to respect differences and develop empathy; and (b) what is the number of special needs students who have switched from mainstream schools to special education schools in each of the past five years and what are the top three reasons given by the students or their parents for the switch.","Mr Ng Chee Meng: All teachers have the basic professional awareness of special needs. Some teachers undergo more training to enable them to plan and differentiate the instructional strategies to support the learning of these students. With greater awareness and knowledge in special needs, teachers are also able to inculcate empathy and respect of differences in their students, and to foster an inclusive class culture.Students learn specific ways to demonstrate care for people with special needs, such as reaching out to make friends, including them in activities and volunteering to help them. Beyond the classroom lessons, Co-Curricular Activities and Values in Action programmes also create opportunities for students to interact and put their values into practice.Over the past five years, about 180 students each year, mostly at the primary level, have moved on to SPED schools. These are students with severe special educational needs and behavioural issues."
pension payments in people's association's annual reports,"Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) what is the rationale for pension contributions of $366,000 and $802,000 for 2016 and 2015 respectively as reported in the PA's Annual Report for 2015/16, when the pension scheme no longer exists; (b) why have these amounts been previously classified as ""termination benefits"" in past reports; and (c) who are the beneficiaries of these payments.","Mr Chan Chun Sing (for the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth): These pension contributions were paid to staff who were already on pension schemes, who were either (i) transferred to the People’s Association (PA) from then-Ministry of Community Development in 1993; or (ii) seconded to PA from their parent organisations. PA no longer has a pension scheme.Second, these contributions consist of once-off retention bonuses paid to junior grade officers upon fulfilment of their contract terms as per common industry practice.The term ""termination benefits"" in past Annual Reports was renamed as ""pension contributions"" to better reflect the nature of such payments."
cpr training for all national servicemen,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Defence whether the SAF will train all servicemen on techniques of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and use of the automated external defibrillator considering that it is a basic and crucial form of first-aid in the event of a terror attack.,"Dr Ng Eng Hen: Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and the use of an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) are medical skills that are important both during SAF training and in operations. During Basic Military Training (BMT), all recruits are trained in basic first aid. Since September 2010, they are also trained in CPR and use of AED. In addition, servicemen deployed as instructors in SAF Training Institutes and in medical vocations undergo regular CPR and AED training. Operationally-ready NSmen in medical vocations are also required to attend CPR and AED training, during their in-camp training. SAF's CPR and AED training programme is accredited by the National Resuscitation Council."
bogus jobs for work pass applications,Ms K Thanaletchimi asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what stringent measures are in place to prevent attempts by groups to use bogus jobs to trick the authorities into approving work permits/passes to foreign workers; (b) what enforcement measures are in place to ensure that employers do not harbour illegal workers; and (c) whether the current penalties are adequate to deter unscrupulous employers from committing such offences of harbouring illegal workers.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: It is against the law for employers to bring in foreign workers without the intention to employ them and allowing these workers to find their own employment. It is also illegal for other employers to hire foreign workers who are released by their official employers to find their own work. MOM takes a serious view of such offences and has put in measures to address both the supply and demand sides.On the supply side, MOM has taken steps to detect fraudulent applications upstream and proactively enforce downstream. We pick out dubious companies and subject them to additional checks when they put in work pass applications. Downstream, MOM carries out proactive enforcement operations against suspected syndicates which are detected through our intel capabilities. The recent island-wide enforcement operation that MOM conducted in July is an example of our continuous efforts to take down syndicates that bring in foreign workers for illegal employment.On the demand side, MOM deters the demand for illegal workers through education and taking errant employers to task. MOM issues reminders to main contractors that they have an obligation under the law to ensure that all foreign workers, including those of their sub-contractors, at their worksites have valid work passes showing the right employers. The reminders also emphasise that non-compliance would be dealt with severely. Those who disregard the law are taken to task.The penalties for bringing in illegal workers have been stepped up for greater deterrence. With the amendment of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (EFMA) in November 2012, those who operate shell companies and import labour illegally face imprisonment between six months and two years, and a fine up to $6,000 per charge. For severe cases, the offender is also liable to be caned. In July this year, a Singaporean man was sentenced to 40 months in jail for his role in setting up two shell companies and obtaining work passes for 46 foreigners without the intention to employ them. In addition, employers who hire illegal foreign workers face a fine of between $5,000 and $30,000 or up to 12 months’ imprisonment or both. Offenders will also be debarred from hiring foreign workers.MOM will continue to take a holistic approach to deal with persons and syndicates who perpetuate the illegal importation of labour. We will not hesitate to take offenders to task."
rationale behind policy of not recognising children of unwed mothers as legitimate children,Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin asked ask the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what are the past and present reasons underpinning the policy of not recognising children of unwed mothers as legitimate children; (b) what are the best avenues of assistance for single unwed mothers who wish to adopt their own child to make them legitimate but struggle to afford the legal fees to do so; and (c) how does the Ministry protect the welfare of minors whose single unwed mother died without a will and their status of illegitimacy denies them a share of their mother's assets.,"Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: The family is the basic building block of our society. Strong marriages are the key to strong families, and parenthood within marriage is the desired and prevailing social norm. Hence, benefits such as the Baby Bonus cash gift, housing benefits and tax reliefs are provided to families with legitimate children, to encourage births within marriages. Other benefits that support the growth and development of children are given to all children. These include the recently extended Child Development Account (CDA) benefits, as well as education and healthcare subsidies, the Medisave grant for newborns, infant care and childcare subsidies and the foreign domestic worker levy concession.Those who have difficulty affording legal fees (including unwed mothers who wish to adopt their own child) may approach the Legal Aid Bureau for assistance. Applicants will have to satisfy a means test and a merits test to qualify for legal aid.Every situation involving an illegitimate child is different. The Government thus considers each case that it comes across, before deciding the appropriate course of action to take. For instance, illegitimate children can inherit their mother’s estate if their mother dies without a will, and has no surviving legitimate children. They may also have other family or social support. These are scenarios where the individual would not need Government support. For children who are vulnerable, MSF's Social Service Offices will assess their needs, provide financial assistance and coordinate support with other social service agencies, where necessary. If there is clearly no next of kin and the safety of the minor (aged 16 and below) is compromised, my Ministry can apply for a court order to place the minor in an alternative environment."
process for stateless in singapore to be recognised as permanent residents or citizens,Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what are the requirements that the stateless need to meet to be recognised as PRs and citizens; (b) whether the stateless can count on having citizen relatives as a positive factor in their applications; and (c) what is the Ministry's advice for stateless parents who have failed multiple times at getting PR or citizenship for themselves but are now seeking a solution for their Singapore-born children not to be labelled stateless as well.,"Mr K Shanmugam: Each application for Permanent Residency (PR) and Singapore Citizenship (SC), including those submitted by stateless individuals, is evaluated on a range of criteria, including economic contributions, education qualifications, family profile and length of stay in Singapore. The person must be able to make a positive contribution to the country, as a citizen. The fact that there are SC family members, for example, an SC spouse or child, would be a plus factor in the evaluation. The circumstances in which the person became stateless may also be relevant. People may, for example, have chosen to give up their foreign citizenship, or may not have acquired foreign citizenship because of the actions/inactions of their parents. There are also some who are stateless, by reason of not applying for citizenship in Singapore previously. The different circumstances will have to be considered and not everyone who is stateless, and in Singapore, can be treated in the same way.As of end August 2016, around 82% of the stateless persons in Singapore have become PRs, and enjoy the various benefits such as healthcare, housing and education that are accorded to PRs. These stateless PRs can also acquire SC if they meet the necessary requirements.A child born in Singapore to a stateless parent may be eligible for Singapore Citizenship at birth. This can happen if his other parent is a Singapore Citizen, and the parents are legally married to each other at the time of his birth.A child born in Singapore to a stateless parent may also obtain foreign citizenship. This can happen if the child’s other parent holds foreign citizenship, and manages to obtain foreign citizenship for his child through his home country. However, if the foreign parent chooses not to apply for, or fails to acquire, such foreign citizenship for the child through his home country, then the child will become stateless.A child born in Singapore will become stateless if neither of his parents are Singapore citizens or citizens of another country."
employers' obligations to offer insurance and medical coverage for female employees in response to zika virus threat,"Ms K Thanaletchimi asked the Minister for Manpower given the global nature of businesses and the Zika virus threat, whether the Government finds it necessary to raise awareness of employers' obligations and enable them to put in place response measures such as medical coverage, paid leave and insurance for the protection of female employees.","Mr Lim Swee Say: The global nature of some businesses today may require more frequent travel, resulting in employees being more exposed to external health risks, such as the Zika virus. To raise employers' awareness about their obligations with regard to these health risks, we have issued advisories in the past for the pandemic influenza H1N1 and MERS-CoV to help employers take appropriate measures.These advisories covered employers' obligations in three broad areas. First, pre-travel. Employers should regularly check the Ministry of Health’s website for the latest updates on affected countries, and take reference from advisories issued by MOH when deciding on business travel plans.Second, if travel to affected countries is unavoidable, employers should advise employees to take the necessary precautions as per MOH's advisories.Third, if employees are found to be infected upon return, employers are required to provide them paid sick leave in accordance with the Employment Act, and extend appropriate medical coverage and insurance, as stipulated under their employment contracts or collective agreements.These obligations for post-travel also apply for local transmission of Zika. MOM recently issued advisories to employers and dormitory operators on measures to limit the spread of the Zika virus. They provide guidance for managing pregnant employees and employees suspected of infection. MOM is also working closely with relevant agencies to step up checks on worksites and dormitories.Everyone - workers, employers and dormitory operators – has to play his part to help minimise local transmission of Zika."
decision not to hold state funeral for late former president ong teng cheong,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Prime Minister (a) whether the Cabinet offered the family of the late former President Ong Teng Cheong the choice to hold a state funeral; (b) if so, what was the decision of Mr Ong's family when offered; (c) if not, what were the considerations by the Cabinet in deciding not to offer a State Funeral to Mr Ong's family; and (d) whether the Government will consider honouring all past presidents with a State Funeral when they pass on.","Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien (for the Prime Minister): This issue has been raised before and the Government has explained its position publicly.It is right and fitting that when Singaporeans who have made major contributions to the country pass away, they are honoured and mourned by the nation. The decision of how to honour the person, including whether to hold a State Funeral, is made by the Government of the day after consulting the family. The appropriate way to do so will vary with each individual. It is not feasible to set a formula as to who should receive a state funeral, simply based on the person’s rank or appointment held.When Mr Ong Teng Cheong passed away in 2002, the then Cabinet arranged a State-Assisted funeral for Mr Ong after consulting with his family. This included the following The state flag was flown at half-mast on all Government buildings on 11 February 2002; the SAF and Police provided the Coffin Bearer party; vigil guards were deployed as a mark of respect; there was an escort band for the funeral march; the SAF helped to organise the family wake and crematorium service, and the Police assisted in crowd and traffic control."
regulation of online providers of legal aid,"Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Minister for Law what is being done to effectively monitor and regulate online providers of legal aid, templates and advice and to ensure that the companies/businesses/legal practitioners providing such an online service are duly qualified and properly regulated by the legal profession and in conformity with the regulations.","Mr K Shanmugam: The practice of law in Singapore is subject to licensing and regulatory requirements under the Legal Profession Act, whether the legal services are provided online or otherwise.Section 33 of the Legal Profession Act sets out the services that can only be provided by persons who are duly qualified and authorised to practise law in Singapore. A person who breaches this provision is liable to be prosecuted for an offence.At present, there are a wide variety of products and services offered online to assist those with legal needs. Some, though not necessarily all, of what is offered may constitute legal services regulated under the Legal Profession Act. Each provider has its own service model, and some of these online providers may not even be physically based in Singapore, even though their products and services may be accessible from Singapore.It is not practical for the Ministry to pro-actively seek out and monitor each and every website that purports to offer assistance to those with legal needs for compliance with the Legal Profession Act.Members of the public may visit the Legal Services Regulatory Authority's portal on the Ministry of Law's website to check if the service provider is a licensed law practice. If a member of the public is of the view that there has been a breach of the regulatory requirements, he or she can file a complaint with the police, which can then look into the matter."
sensors in buses to prevent elderly from falling,"Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Transport if the Ministry will consider requiring all buses to be fitted with intelligent sensors to assist bus drivers when approaching curbs at bus stops as a measure to prevent the elderly from falling between the bus door and curb, especially when alighting.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Bus captains are trained to pull up to within half a metre from the kerb at bus stops, and to ensure commuters have alighted safely before moving off. To help them to do so, LTA is studying the feasibility of sensors that can detect the kerb and objects around the bus."
reconstruction of apron drains and uneven void deck floors in neighbourhood renewal programme,Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for National Development whether HDB will include the option to reconstruct apron drains and rescreed void decks under block-related works for Town Councils in its Neighbourhood Renewal Programme (NRP) manual.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Since September 2014, the scope of the Neighbourhood Renewal Programme has been expanded to include additional works such as repainting and various repair works. The repair works include the reconstruction of apron drains and the rescreeding of void decks. The expanded scope is applicable to projects selected from FY2015 onwards.HDB had informed all Town Councils of the expanded scope in September 2014."
rationale for staff disciplinary actions before conclusion of coroner's inquiry for 22 march fatal train incident,"Mr Yee Chia Hsing asked the Minister for Transport with regard to the MRT train incident on 22 March 2016, whether it is premature for SMRT to take disciplinary action against staff before the conclusion of investigations and the coroner's inquiry.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: It is SMRT’s prerogative to take disciplinary action against its staff in accordance with its established procedures. However, as the Member has pointed out, investigations by the Land Transport Authority, the Ministry of Manpower and Police are still on-going. An argument can therefore be made that in this case it would have been better to wait till these investigations come to some conclusions. I note that NTWU has lodged an appeal on behalf of the two staff, and SMRT has convened an Appeal Panel to review the case. I am sure that the Panel will give full consideration to all the relevant factors, and reach a fair decision."
bogus jobs for work pass applications,Ms K Thanaletchimi asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what stringent measures are in place to prevent attempts by groups to use bogus jobs to trick the authorities into approving work permits/passes to foreign workers; (b) what enforcement measures are in place to ensure that employers do not harbour illegal workers; and (c) whether the current penalties are adequate to deter unscrupulous employers from committing such offences of harbouring illegal workers.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: It is against the law for employers to bring in foreign workers without the intention to employ them and allowing these workers to find their own employment. It is also illegal for other employers to hire foreign workers who are released by their official employers to find their own work. MOM takes a serious view of such offences and has put in measures to address both the supply and demand sides.On the supply side, MOM has taken steps to detect fraudulent applications upstream and proactively enforce downstream. We pick out dubious companies and subject them to additional checks when they put in work pass applications. Downstream, MOM carries out proactive enforcement operations against suspected syndicates which are detected through our intel capabilities. The recent island-wide enforcement operation that MOM conducted in July is an example of our continuous efforts to take down syndicates that bring in foreign workers for illegal employment.On the demand side, MOM deters the demand for illegal workers through education and taking errant employers to task. MOM issues reminders to main contractors that they have an obligation under the law to ensure that all foreign workers, including those of their sub-contractors, at their worksites have valid work passes showing the right employers. The reminders also emphasise that non-compliance would be dealt with severely. Those who disregard the law are taken to task.The penalties for bringing in illegal workers have been stepped up for greater deterrence. With the amendment of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (EFMA) in November 2012, those who operate shell companies and import labour illegally face imprisonment between six months and two years, and a fine up to $6,000 per charge. For severe cases, the offender is also liable to be caned. In July this year, a Singaporean man was sentenced to 40 months in jail for his role in setting up two shell companies and obtaining work passes for 46 foreigners without the intention to employ them. In addition, employers who hire illegal foreign workers face a fine of between $5,000 and $30,000 or up to 12 months’ imprisonment or both. Offenders will also be debarred from hiring foreign workers.MOM will continue to take a holistic approach to deal with persons and syndicates who perpetuate the illegal importation of labour. We will not hesitate to take offenders to task."
rationale behind policy of not recognising children of unwed mothers as legitimate children,Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin asked ask the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what are the past and present reasons underpinning the policy of not recognising children of unwed mothers as legitimate children; (b) what are the best avenues of assistance for single unwed mothers who wish to adopt their own child to make them legitimate but struggle to afford the legal fees to do so; and (c) how does the Ministry protect the welfare of minors whose single unwed mother died without a will and their status of illegitimacy denies them a share of their mother's assets.,"Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: The family is the basic building block of our society. Strong marriages are the key to strong families, and parenthood within marriage is the desired and prevailing social norm. Hence, benefits such as the Baby Bonus cash gift, housing benefits and tax reliefs are provided to families with legitimate children, to encourage births within marriages. Other benefits that support the growth and development of children are given to all children. These include the recently extended Child Development Account (CDA) benefits, as well as education and healthcare subsidies, the Medisave grant for newborns, infant care and childcare subsidies and the foreign domestic worker levy concession.Those who have difficulty affording legal fees (including unwed mothers who wish to adopt their own child) may approach the Legal Aid Bureau for assistance. Applicants will have to satisfy a means test and a merits test to qualify for legal aid.Every situation involving an illegitimate child is different. The Government thus considers each case that it comes across, before deciding the appropriate course of action to take. For instance, illegitimate children can inherit their mother’s estate if their mother dies without a will, and has no surviving legitimate children. They may also have other family or social support. These are scenarios where the individual would not need Government support. For children who are vulnerable, MSF's Social Service Offices will assess their needs, provide financial assistance and coordinate support with other social service agencies, where necessary. If there is clearly no next of kin and the safety of the minor (aged 16 and below) is compromised, my Ministry can apply for a court order to place the minor in an alternative environment."
process for stateless in singapore to be recognised as permanent residents or citizens,Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what are the requirements that the stateless need to meet to be recognised as PRs and citizens; (b) whether the stateless can count on having citizen relatives as a positive factor in their applications; and (c) what is the Ministry's advice for stateless parents who have failed multiple times at getting PR or citizenship for themselves but are now seeking a solution for their Singapore-born children not to be labelled stateless as well.,"Mr K Shanmugam: Each application for Permanent Residency (PR) and Singapore Citizenship (SC), including those submitted by stateless individuals, is evaluated on a range of criteria, including economic contributions, education qualifications, family profile and length of stay in Singapore. The person must be able to make a positive contribution to the country, as a citizen. The fact that there are SC family members, for example, an SC spouse or child, would be a plus factor in the evaluation. The circumstances in which the person became stateless may also be relevant. People may, for example, have chosen to give up their foreign citizenship, or may not have acquired foreign citizenship because of the actions/inactions of their parents. There are also some who are stateless, by reason of not applying for citizenship in Singapore previously. The different circumstances will have to be considered and not everyone who is stateless, and in Singapore, can be treated in the same way.As of end August 2016, around 82% of the stateless persons in Singapore have become PRs, and enjoy the various benefits such as healthcare, housing and education that are accorded to PRs. These stateless PRs can also acquire SC if they meet the necessary requirements.A child born in Singapore to a stateless parent may be eligible for Singapore Citizenship at birth. This can happen if his other parent is a Singapore Citizen, and the parents are legally married to each other at the time of his birth.A child born in Singapore to a stateless parent may also obtain foreign citizenship. This can happen if the child’s other parent holds foreign citizenship, and manages to obtain foreign citizenship for his child through his home country. However, if the foreign parent chooses not to apply for, or fails to acquire, such foreign citizenship for the child through his home country, then the child will become stateless.A child born in Singapore will become stateless if neither of his parents are Singapore citizens or citizens of another country."
employers' obligations to offer insurance and medical coverage for female employees in response to zika virus threat,"Ms K Thanaletchimi asked the Minister for Manpower given the global nature of businesses and the Zika virus threat, whether the Government finds it necessary to raise awareness of employers' obligations and enable them to put in place response measures such as medical coverage, paid leave and insurance for the protection of female employees.","Mr Lim Swee Say: The global nature of some businesses today may require more frequent travel, resulting in employees being more exposed to external health risks, such as the Zika virus. To raise employers' awareness about their obligations with regard to these health risks, we have issued advisories in the past for the pandemic influenza H1N1 and MERS-CoV to help employers take appropriate measures.These advisories covered employers' obligations in three broad areas. First, pre-travel. Employers should regularly check the Ministry of Health’s website for the latest updates on affected countries, and take reference from advisories issued by MOH when deciding on business travel plans.Second, if travel to affected countries is unavoidable, employers should advise employees to take the necessary precautions as per MOH's advisories.Third, if employees are found to be infected upon return, employers are required to provide them paid sick leave in accordance with the Employment Act, and extend appropriate medical coverage and insurance, as stipulated under their employment contracts or collective agreements.These obligations for post-travel also apply for local transmission of Zika. MOM recently issued advisories to employers and dormitory operators on measures to limit the spread of the Zika virus. They provide guidance for managing pregnant employees and employees suspected of infection. MOM is also working closely with relevant agencies to step up checks on worksites and dormitories.Everyone - workers, employers and dormitory operators – has to play his part to help minimise local transmission of Zika."
decision not to hold state funeral for late former president ong teng cheong,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Prime Minister (a) whether the Cabinet offered the family of the late former President Ong Teng Cheong the choice to hold a state funeral; (b) if so, what was the decision of Mr Ong's family when offered; (c) if not, what were the considerations by the Cabinet in deciding not to offer a State Funeral to Mr Ong's family; and (d) whether the Government will consider honouring all past presidents with a State Funeral when they pass on.","Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien (for the Prime Minister): This issue has been raised before and the Government has explained its position publicly.It is right and fitting that when Singaporeans who have made major contributions to the country pass away, they are honoured and mourned by the nation. The decision of how to honour the person, including whether to hold a State Funeral, is made by the Government of the day after consulting the family. The appropriate way to do so will vary with each individual. It is not feasible to set a formula as to who should receive a state funeral, simply based on the person’s rank or appointment held.When Mr Ong Teng Cheong passed away in 2002, the then Cabinet arranged a State-Assisted funeral for Mr Ong after consulting with his family. This included the following The state flag was flown at half-mast on all Government buildings on 11 February 2002; the SAF and Police provided the Coffin Bearer party; vigil guards were deployed as a mark of respect; there was an escort band for the funeral march; the SAF helped to organise the family wake and crematorium service, and the Police assisted in crowd and traffic control."
regulation of online providers of legal aid,"Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Minister for Law what is being done to effectively monitor and regulate online providers of legal aid, templates and advice and to ensure that the companies/businesses/legal practitioners providing such an online service are duly qualified and properly regulated by the legal profession and in conformity with the regulations.","Mr K Shanmugam: The practice of law in Singapore is subject to licensing and regulatory requirements under the Legal Profession Act, whether the legal services are provided online or otherwise.Section 33 of the Legal Profession Act sets out the services that can only be provided by persons who are duly qualified and authorised to practise law in Singapore. A person who breaches this provision is liable to be prosecuted for an offence.At present, there are a wide variety of products and services offered online to assist those with legal needs. Some, though not necessarily all, of what is offered may constitute legal services regulated under the Legal Profession Act. Each provider has its own service model, and some of these online providers may not even be physically based in Singapore, even though their products and services may be accessible from Singapore.It is not practical for the Ministry to pro-actively seek out and monitor each and every website that purports to offer assistance to those with legal needs for compliance with the Legal Profession Act.Members of the public may visit the Legal Services Regulatory Authority's portal on the Ministry of Law's website to check if the service provider is a licensed law practice. If a member of the public is of the view that there has been a breach of the regulatory requirements, he or she can file a complaint with the police, which can then look into the matter."
sensors in buses to prevent elderly from falling,"Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Transport if the Ministry will consider requiring all buses to be fitted with intelligent sensors to assist bus drivers when approaching curbs at bus stops as a measure to prevent the elderly from falling between the bus door and curb, especially when alighting.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Bus captains are trained to pull up to within half a metre from the kerb at bus stops, and to ensure commuters have alighted safely before moving off. To help them to do so, LTA is studying the feasibility of sensors that can detect the kerb and objects around the bus."
reconstruction of apron drains and uneven void deck floors in neighbourhood renewal programme,Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for National Development whether HDB will include the option to reconstruct apron drains and rescreed void decks under block-related works for Town Councils in its Neighbourhood Renewal Programme (NRP) manual.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Since September 2014, the scope of the Neighbourhood Renewal Programme has been expanded to include additional works such as repainting and various repair works. The repair works include the reconstruction of apron drains and the rescreeding of void decks. The expanded scope is applicable to projects selected from FY2015 onwards.HDB had informed all Town Councils of the expanded scope in September 2014."
publication of smrt's financial statements after take-over by temasek holdings,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Transport whether SMRT will continue to publish detailed financial and operating information when it becomes wholly owned by Temasek Holdings.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: In accordance with the Companies Act, SMRT will be required to file its annual audited financial statements with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA). Members of the public can obtain the information from ACRA."
review of heavy vehicle season parking scheme,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the progress in the review of the heavy vehicle season parking scheme; (b) when will drivers be able to change their existing season parking location to the location that they desire, subject to availability; and (c) whether there is a plan to build additional car parks for heavy vehicles at Old Tampines Road and Sengkang for residents at Hougang, Compassvale, Rivervale, Anchorvale and Fernvale.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Currently there are 43,785 heavy vehicle parking spaces island-wide, compared to a total of 33,760 heavy vehicles. About 74% of the spaces are provided by the private sector and 26% provided by URA and HDB. There are thus more than sufficient heavy vehicle parking spaces to meet total demand. The problem is a mismatch of demand at specific locations.There is a high demand for heavy vehicle parking spaces near residential areas, as drivers prefer to park near where they live. However, it is not possible for the Government to provide more such spaces in residential estates, as most of our estates are highly built up and heavy vehicles generate disamenities such as noise, fumes and additional traffic.Ultimately, it is the responsibility of business owners to provide parking solutions for the vehicles they own, and also to work with their drivers on the appropriate transport options to commute to work, especially for those who have to drive during the wee hours.URA and HDB allocate heavy vehicle season parking on a first-come first-served basis to residents who either live near or whose businesses are located near the vicinity of the heavy vehicle park. Transfer of location of the season parking places within public heavy vehicle parks is allowed, subject to availability. URA also allows mutual exchange of the season parking locations among drivers within its heavy vehicle parks.Finally, there are about 1,640 public heavy vehicle parking spaces within the vicinity of Tampines Road and Sengkang. Season parking at these heavy vehicle parks are fully allocated. There are no plans to provide additional public heavy vehicle parking spaces in this area."
penalty for dislodged air-conditioning units,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development (a) in the last five years, how many home owners have been prosecuted or penalised for their air-conditioners falling off from their flats due to improper maintenance; and (b) whether the current measures to protect a person's safety from falling air-conditioners is sufficient.","Mr Lawrence Wong: There have been three cases in the past five years where air-conditioners became dislodged and fell. As homeowners are responsible for the maintenance of their air-conditioning units and their accompanying installations, the homeowners in these cases were issued composition fines under the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act (BMSMA).Under the BMSMA, BCA can issue a Notice to homeowners to carry out improvement works to their air-conditioning units, should there be evidence of disrepair. This includes installations like the metal brackets holding the air-conditioning units in place. The Act also allows for errant homeowners to be issued composition fines or prosecuted.To reduce the risk of incidents, new buildings are designed with concrete ledges or steel casings to hold the air-conditioning units. In addition, the installation of air-conditioning units on the building exterior can only be performed by trained installers. This is to ensure that the work complies with safety requirements and that it is carried out in the manner stipulated under the Building Control Regulations. MND also worked with Town Councils to disseminate flyers informing residents of their responsibilities for maintaining their air-conditioning units.While the occurrence of falling air-conditioning units is rare, we cannot be complacent. The government will continue to engage homeowners and remind them of the role that they play in creating a safe living environment. Homeowners should also carry out checks every six months to ensure that there are no loosened or corroded parts in their air-conditioning units, as well as in the installations that hold these units in place."
publication of full report of 22 march fatal train incident,"Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether LTA will make public the full report of the Accident Review Panel which investigated the fatal accident that occurred on 22 March 2016 near Pasir Ris MRT station; and (b) whether the Panel had concluded that the train driver was at fault and, if so, how was he at fault.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The Accident Review Panel was convened by SMRT and it is their prerogative to decide whether to make the full report public. Findings from the investigations by the Land Transport Authority and the Ministry of Manpower will be made public after all investigations, including a possible Coroner's Inquiry, have been completed. This is so as not to prejudice any of the proceedings."
prevalence of children with learning disabilities per cohort,Ms Sun Xueling asked the Minister for Social and Family Development what is the percentage of children in a cohort who suffer from learning disabilities and whether there are programmes which the Ministry supports at a pre-school level to encourage children with learning disabilities to learn through play and interaction.,"Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: My Ministry works closely with KKH and NUH in the Child Development Programme to detect developmental delays in young children at the pre-school stage. While general developmental delays can be detected earlier, learning disabilities typically become clearer at a later stage in children, closer to the school-going age.At a young age, children develop and learn at very different paces. A child's development can also be impacted by environmental factors such as exposure and teaching styles. The pre-school years are too early to make a definite diagnosis for learning disabilities. Learning difficulties are diagnosed conclusively at a later stage; closer to school-going age than at the pre-school stage. About 5% of our student population have been diagnosed with special educational needs.Pre-school children, aged 5 and 6, with mild developmental delays or learning needs are supported by the Developmental Support Programme (DSP). DSP is currently offered in some 300 pre-school centres and have catered to more than 2,000 children since its inception in 2013. Children on the DSP are given the necessary support to level up their developmental domains for school readiness. The programme also enables these children to benefit from a mainstream and inclusive learning environment. With early intervention through the DSP, the child will develop the competencies he or she requires for Primary 1.Children with more severe developmental needs are supported through the Early Intervention Programme for Infants and Children (EIPIC) which is currently available at 17 EIPIC centres across the island.The Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) is working with training institutes to equip pre-school teachers with the necessary skills to support children with learning and developmental needs. Learning through play and interaction with children are key concepts in the early childhood pedagogy. Many of the training for pre-school teachers have embedded techniques on play and interaction in the training programmes. In-service pre-school teachers can also tap on the subsidised Continuing Professional Development courses, such as the Specialist Diploma in Early Childhood Learning Support (SDELS), to enhance their skills in supporting children with developmental needs."
strengthening singaporean core in 'triple weak' companies,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Minister for Manpower whether he can provide an update on the Ministry's drive and enforcement in strengthening the Singaporean core including the scrutiny of triple weak companies.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: We are taking a two-pronged approach to encourage firms to strengthen their Singaporean core.First, in February 2016, the Ministry identified about 100 firms for closer scrutiny. These firms did not seem to have made reasonable efforts to provide fair employment opportunities or have had substantiated complaints of discriminatory practices.After notifying them and scrutinising them for about six months, about one in five have been assessed by TAFEP and sector agencies to have made significant improvements. Their employment practices are now comparable to their industry peers. They have taken pro-active steps to participate in career fairs and training programmes organised by WDA and e2i. Some have taken the further step to develop in-house programmes for knowledge transfer to Singaporean staff. At the recommendation of TAFEP, MOM no longer subjects these firms to closer scrutiny and their EP applications are being processed as per normal.The remaining four in five have shown some progress but MOM will continue to scrutinise their EP applications. As at end September, we have not approved close to 300 EP applications from these firms. We are looking closely at whether they have taken concrete steps to consider Singaporeans fairly for these positions.In addition, we have identified around 180 more firms to be placed on closer scrutiny. This will bring the total firms under closer scrutiny to about 250.Second, we are identifying firms with exemplary fair and progressive human capital practices for differentiated treatment. MOM is launching a Human Capital Partnership Programme to better support them in nurturing our local manpower and strengthening the complementarity of foreign manpower. This will encourage more firms to follow suit. We are in the process of shortlisting the first batch of these firms, working out the details of further support, and aim to launch the programme later this year."
review of cpf investment scheme given continued losses,Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Ministry will consider reviewing the CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS) urgently given that 38% of investors have suffered losses through CPFIS and only 16% of investors in the scheme managed to achieve better than the 2.5% interest rate they would have otherwise earned by leaving their money in the CPF Ordinary Account.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: The CPF Investment Scheme, or the CPFIS for short, was introduced in 1986 to give CPF members an option to invest and manage their CPF savings. CPF members are made aware that they must understand and accept the risk of their investment choices. There are over 700 products to choose from under CPFIS. They should therefore choose CPFIS investments that match their risk tolerance and investment objectives. There is now $24 billion invested through the CPFIS, of which the majority are from the Ordinary Account.In the past five financial years, about 16% of the CPFIS-OA investors were able to realise higher returns than the risk free OA interest rate offered by CPF. However, the other 84% of CPFIS-OA investors did not. In other words, the majority of CPFIS-OA investors would have been better off leaving their savings in their OA to earn the default interest rate, currently at 2.5%. The CPF Advisory Panel made a similar observation in its report that was released in August 2016. Hence, the Panel has recommended that the Government review the current CPFIS to better target it at knowledgeable CPFIS investors who feel confident of managing their investments on their own and have the time to do so. Along with the review of the CPFIS, the Panel also recommended that the Government introduce the Lifetime Retirement Investment Scheme, or the LRIS for short, as a simpler investment option. The LRIS will cater to CPF members who wish to invest their CPF savings, but find the CPFIS too complex and onerous or find it too time-consuming to actively manage their investments.The Government has accepted the Panel's recommendation to review the CPFIS and to study the LRIS. More details will be released later."
review of grant amount to town council given additional maintenance cycles,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry can increase the grant allocated to Town Councils given the additional items or amenities required for cyclical maintenance using the Sinking Fund.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Town Councils fund their operations, including cyclical maintenance and replacement works, primarily through the Service and Conservancy Charges (S&CC) they collect from residents. This is supplemented by an annual operating grant from MND, of about $98 million a year.Town Councils should manage their finances carefully and take appropriate measures to ensure that they have sufficient funds to carry out their statutory responsibilities. This could include putting aside a higher proportion of their S&CC collections and grants-in-aid, beyond the stipulated minimum, in their Sinking Funds. They could also manage expenditures more tightly, and increase S&CC rates, where necessary.MND has been studying ways to help Town Councils ensure their long-term financial sustainability. As announced in September 2016, MND intends to raise the minimum contribution rate into the Sinking Funds, and to require Town Councils to set aside more funds for future lift replacements through a new Lift Replacement Fund. The new Lift Enhancement Programme (LEP), estimated at $450 million over the next 10 years, will also give Town Councils significant help by co-funding about 90% of their lift modernisation costs. This is on top of the existing Lift Upgrading Programme and Selective Lift Replacement Programme, which assist Town Councils with the replacement of their lifts.Notwithstanding these measures, all Town Councils are ultimately responsible for the cyclical maintenance and replacement works in their estates. Town Councils must therefore continue to take a long-term view of their finances and plan ahead for their future expenditures."
subsidy for maternity and delivery services at restructured hospitals for non-singaporean women,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Health other than women who are permanent residents or hold Long-Term Visit Pass-Plus passes, whether pregnant non-Singaporean women whose child will become a Singaporean citizen at birth should benefit from Government subsidies for maternity and delivery services at restructured hospitals.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents receive government subsidies at public healthcare institutions, with citizens receiving a higher level of subsidies. This is in line with the larger Government policy of differentiating social benefits and subsidies by citizenship status.Patients are extended healthcare subsidies based on their citizenship status, and not that of their children. This principle applies to all healthcare services, including maternity and delivery services. For newborns who are Singaporeans, they are eligible for healthcare subsidies and other benefits such as the Medisave Grant for Newborns and the Government's contribution to the Child Development Account.We understand that some Singapore Citizens with non-citizen spouses and some Singaporean children with non-citizen parents may require additional support. This feedback has also been raised by other Members previously. Since 2012, MOH has extended inpatient subsidies to non-citizen spouses who are on Long-Term Visit Pass-Plus.We have to take into account the policy objective of differentiating social benefits and subsidies by citizenship, to give greater support to Singapore Citizens. We also need to be mindful that the cost of giving more government subsidies will ultimately be borne by all Singaporeans. Hence, any proposal to further extend more Government subsidies to foreigners, who are neither Permanent Residents nor Long-Term Visit Pass-Plus holders, would need to be carefully considered."
progress of implementation of silver zones,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the progress of the implementation of the Silver Zones; (b) how has the Ministry sought to seek support from motorists; and (c) whether it has reduced the number of traffic incidents among vulnerable residents such as children and the elderly.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: As of end-August 2016, eight Silver Zones have been completed, out of the 50 that are planned by 2023. The next Silver Zone that will be completed at the end of this month is in Hougang.Silver Zones are implemented with the support of the community. Prior to implementation, LTA distributes flyers and notices to residents, conducts site walks with grassroots leaders, and erects banners and electronic signs to inform motorists of the impending changes. After completion, LTA continues to gather feedback from residents and monitors the traffic situation. There is strong support for the Silver Zone programme, even amongst motorists.This is not surprising because Silver Zones have been tremendously successful in reducing traffic accidents. For the eight locations where there are now Silver Zones, there were 48 accidents involving children and the elderly in the five-year period preceding implementation. Since the Silver Zones were implemented, the first zone two years ago, there has only been one such accident."
solar panels for hdb flats under solarnova tender,"Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for National Development (a) to date, how many HDB blocks under the purview of each Town Council have been selected to be outfitted with solar panels on their rooftops; and (b) how many HDB blocks have been shortlisted for the latest SolarNova tender scheduled for the first half of 2016 and under which Town Councils do these blocks come from.","Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB has assessed that there are around 6,000 HDB blocks islandwide which are suitable for solar panels, spread out amongst all Town Councils. This is based on the roof design, roof space availability and solar irradiance potential of the blocks. HDB intends to install solar panels for all these blocks progressively under the SolarNova programme.To date, about 1,800 blocks have been selected, where the solar panels have either been installed or are currently undergoing installation. They are located across all Town Councils (TC), including Aljunied-Hougang TC. For the upcoming SolarNova tender in 2016, HDB has selected 600 blocks in Ang Mo Kio and Marsiling-Yew Tee Town Councils."

popularity of pre-fabricated construction in building industry,Mr Alex Yam asked the Minister for National Development (a) what has been the overall take-up rate for pre-fabricated construction in the building industry for (i) the public sector and (ii) the private sector; (b) what have been the key benefits of the Prefabricated Prefinished Volumetric Construction (PPVC) method; and (c) how will the Ministry be helping the industry to transit into pre-fabrication over the next few years.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: In prefabricated construction, on-site construction activities are shifted to factories off-site. Components that are prefabricated in the factory are then transported to work sites for installation. This approach is called Design for Manufacturing and Assembly or DfMA. Prefabrication technologies from the DfMA spectrum include structural steel, Prefabricated Bathroom Units, Mass Engineered Timber, and Prefabricated Prefinished Volumetric Construction or PPVC.The overall take up rate for prefabricated construction has been increasing. In the last three years (from 2013-2015) for example, the prefabrication level for public sector projects, in terms of constructed floor area, has increased from 30% to almost 50%. In tandem, the prefabrication level for private sector projects doubled from around 10% to around 20%.This is a positive development because DfMA technologies result in significant manpower savings, shorter construction times, improved workmanship, and reduced dis-amenity to residents. One recent example is the Crowne Plaza Hotel Expansion project at Changi Airport. By using PPVC, the project achieved 40% on-site manpower savings and a three month reduction in construction time.However, we recognise that using new technologies comes with a steep learning curve and a cost premium. So under the Construction Productivity Roadmap, we have taken a multi-pronged approach to build up the DfMA ecosystem and help industry with this transition.(a) First, we are generating lead demand for these technologies through incorporating these building methods in public sector projects, and stipulating certain productivity requirements in government land sales. For example, at selected GLS sites, we have required at least 65% of the applicable floor area to be constructed using PPVC.(b) Second, we are building up our supply capacity by increasing our local production capability and bringing in qualified overseas suppliers;(c) Third, we are easing regulatory hurdles to facilitate the adoption of innovative and productive technologies;(d) Finally, through the Construction Productivity and Capability Fund (CPCF), we will continue to incentivise the adoption of DfMA technologies and encourage industry practitioners to build up their manpower capabilities.Taken together, these measures should drive down the cost premium by achieving greater economies of scale while reducing impediments to DfMA adoption. Ultimately, we hope to see the industry embrace more prefabrication in the future."
take-up rate for home access plan to aid low-income families with internet connectivity,Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Communications and Information with regard to the Home Access plan which makes Internet connectivity more affordable to the low-income group (a) what is the number of beneficiaries who have been pre-qualified for this plan by reason of them participating in government financial assistance schemes; (b) what percentage of such beneficiaries have signed up for the plan to date; (c) how many households have benefitted from the Home Access plan since its commencement in September 2014; and (d) what further plans does the Ministry have to improve digital inclusion amongst low-income households.,"Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim: Digital inclusion is a priority for my ministry. All Singaporeans must be able to access the opportunities in the digital economy, especially low income households, the elderly, and people with special needs. That is why IDA has implemented digital inclusion programmes for a decade, which have benefited more than 32,000 low-income households.Our Digital Inclusion initiative comprises several programmes, including the Home Access Programme and NEU PC Plus. The Home Access Programme, which Mr Murali Pillai asked about, provides low income families without school-going children with subsidised broadband connectivity and a tablet. So far, 5,000 households have benefited from the Home Access Programme.Mr Murali asked about the number of households which have pre-qualified for this Programme. Over 2,000 households which are on long-term Government assistance schemes have been pre-qualified and notified. To date, 100 of these households are on the Home Access Programme. The rest may not see a need to take up this scheme at this time.The NEU PC Plus Programme is targeted at low income households with school children and persons with disabilities, who may need more support for their schooling and other needs. The Programme provides beneficiaries with a desktop or laptop, and three years of free broadband. These schemes require a small co-payment, but needy families can tap on IDA’s iNSPIRE and defray their co-payment by doing some community service. More than 27,000 low-income households have benefitted from NEU PC Plus.We constantly enhance our schemes to keep pace with the changing infocomm landscape. Earlier this month, I announced two enhancements to the NEU PC Plus programme. First, we raised the monthly household income cap from $3,000 to $3,400. We also raised the per capital monthly income for households with persons with disabilities from $875 to $1,125. These changes have enabled another 5,000 households to benefit from the scheme over the next five years. The second enhancement makes provision to allow special education students already on financial assistance to receive a subsidy of up to 75% more easily. Previously, there would be an assessment on whether their subsidies are pegged at up to 50% or 75%. Now, they would qualify for the up to 75% directly."
fostering community unity with sgsecure,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Home Affairs how SGSecure will help foster the unity needed to overcome threats to Singapore.,"Mr K Shanmugam: SGSecure is a call to action to Singaporeans to unite and prepare for the threat of a terrorist attack.SGSecure builds on the work that we embarked upon in 2006 under the Community Engagement Programme, or CEP. The CEP began as an initiative to preserve and strengthen communal harmony and cohesion in the aftermath of a terror attack. We decided to do this because we saw what happened after the London 7/7 bombings in 2005, when some segments of the community became targets of hate crime. Over time, the CEP expanded its objectives to also prepare our people to be resilient and better prepared for any crisis or emergency. In the last 10 years, the CEP has laid the groundwork and built networks of trust, so that we will stand strong and united.In today’s heightened security climate, it is even more urgent that we continue to strengthen the bonds among our various communities. Terrorist attacks can have a crippling effect on societies that extends beyond the physical devastation. In some instances, we have seen how terrorism has fomented distrust among fellow citizens, making their efforts to stand united and bounce back as one people more challenging.There are lessons for Singapore in this regard. We must ask ourselves how we will react when a terrorist attack happens here, especially if the perpetrators are fellow Singaporeans. Will our communal ties remain strong? Will we be able to overcome suspicion and fear? Will we refrain from pointing fingers, and instead help and support fellow Singaporeans, regardless of race or religion, to overcome the trauma of an attack?To enhance our community response, two key pillars in SGSecure – ""Stay United"" and ""Stay Strong"" – will specifically focus on the need for the community to stay united in the aftermath of a terrorist attack, to pull closer together by helping one another, and to be able to bounce back quickly to show that we will not be cowed.SGSecure will be officially launched by the Prime Minister on 24 September. Members will hear more about the SGSecure programmes which MHA and its partner agencies will be rolling out across the various domains, such as schools, workplaces, national service community and community groups."
accreditation and licensing of psychologists and psychotherapists,Ms K Thanaletchimi asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry will consider accreditation and licensing of the psychologist profession and the setting up of professional standards so that the interest of Singaporeans seeking such services is safeguarded.,"39 Ms K Thanaletchimi asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry will consider accreditation and licensing of the psychotherapist profession and the setting up of professional standards so that the interest of Singaporeans seeking such services is safeguarded.Mr Gan Kim Yong: The registration of clinical psychologists and other allied health professionals is provided for under the Allied Health Professions Act. Since 2013, we have registered occupational therapists, physiotherapists, speech-language therapists and from April this year, diagnostic radiographers and radiation therapists.Psychologists' practices cover a wide range of job roles and settings beyond healthcare. For example, there are also educational psychologists, social psychologists, counselling psychologists and organisational and occupational psychologists. Given this wide range, we are studying in greater detail the issue of accrediting and licensing clinical psychologists. We are currently engaging the stakeholders to address such issues.In comparison, Psychotherapy is broadly used for mental health therapy, marriage and family therapy and other personal social problems. Health care professionals such as psychiatrists, psychologists, medical social workers and nurses can apply psychotherapy or a form of it in their course of work. It is also used in non-health care related counselling. Psychotherapy is thus less well-defined and given its use across different groups and in different life situations and settings, it would be impractical to regulate the practice of psychotherapy currently.The Singapore Psychological Society and the Association of Psychotherapists and Counsellors have voluntary membership for psychologists and psychotherapists in Singapore. These organisations have published their own standards e.g. a code of ethics to guide their members and membership criteria."
action against anti-social neighbours,"Mr Darryl David asked the Minister for National Development what action can be taken towards recalcitrant HDB residents who create persistent problems for their neighbours such as noise pollution, hoarding, cluttering public areas, poor environmental hygiene and disrupting the peace.","Mr Lawrence Wong: The approach to take depends on the nature of the issue involved. If there are clear regulatory breaches by these ""recalcitrant residents"", then it is best to approach the relevant agency. For instance, if the issue is over obstruction of the common corridor, and there is a clear breach of the rules, then residents can approach the Town Councils. If it is a case of smoking or littering, then NEA will enforce. Or if it is a case of hoarding, then HDB officers will step in to carry out inspections, and if the hoarding is assessed to be excessive, HDB will ask the residents to remove the unwanted items.Sometimes, the anti-social behaviours may not be regulatory breaches but involve private disputes between neighbours. In such cases, we want as much as possible for the individuals concerned to take responsibility and ownership of their own issues. They should first speak to each other and strive to resolve the matter amicably. If the issue cannot be resolved, disputants can seek help from a neutral third party, such as a grassroots leader to facilitate resolution. Such intervention or informal mediation goes a long way to prevent simple conflicts from escalating further.Should informal mediation be unsuccessful, the case can be referred to the Community Mediation Centre (CMC) for mediation. Where the cases involve long-standing and intractable disputes between neighbours, the aggrieved parties can bring a claim to the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals as a last resort."
singapore's financial contribution to support syrian refugees,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether the Ministry will consider increasing Singapore's financial contribution to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in order to provide more support to Syrian refugees in light of the escalating humanitarian crisis unfolding in Syria.,"Dr Vivian Balakrishnan: Mr Ng asked whether the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would consider increasing Singapore’s financial contribution to the Office of UN High Commissioner for Refugees, or UNHCR, in order to provide more support to Syrian refugees in light of the ongoing Syrian conflict.Singapore commends the UNHCR, and other humanitarian organisations, for their tremendous efforts to save lives in Syria in challenging conditions.As I said in this House in January this year, Singapore will continue to support the work of the UNHCR and humanitarian groups as they seek to alleviate the suffering of the Syrian people.Singapore has been providing voluntary financial contributions to the UNHCR annually. We are not a major donor but a small country with limited resources. But as a responsible global citizen, we have increased our contributions to the UNHCR this year from US$50,000 to US$60,000. This is in recognition of the acute demands placed on the UNHCR, not just in Syria, but all around the world. Our contribution is comparable to those made by other ASEAN countries.The Syrian conflict is now into its sixth year. More than 400,000 Syrians have been killed. There are now more than 4.8 million Syrian refugees, and millions of internally displaced.The key actors in this conflict have acknowledged that the only way to end this conflict is to reach a political solution. We hope they can achieve this as soon as possible while ensuring the safety of civilians and that humanitarian assistance reaches those in need."
benefits and allowances for grassroots leaders and advisers,"Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth what are the past and current benefits given to grassroots leaders and advisers in terms of housing priority, primary school admission, allowance, and other benefits in kind.","Mr Chan Chun Sing (for the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth): Grassroots Leaders (GRLs) are volunteers who serve the community actively. They help bond residents to weave our social fabric; gather feedback for government to improve our policies and services; and they help to close the last mile in our policy communications and delivery.The Government recognises GRLs' contributions and facilitates their community work. Information on these schemes has been provided during previous Parliament sittings and has also been made available online separately.To facilitate their work, like engaging residents and conducting community activities, GRLs may apply for a special parking label after first purchasing a HDB season parking label. This label allows them to park at designated car parks up to 11 pm in the constituency they serve.Eligible GRLs can apply for P1 registration for their children under Phase 2B in schools within the constituency they reside in. This is similar to school and parent volunteers. Eligible GRLs can apply for BTO flats and ECs under a HDB scheme. These long serving GRLs typically help to bond the new communities in the new estates. These schemes recognise the GRLs' contributions to community building and provide platforms for them to continue strengthening their community services.To facilitate their work in their constituencies, Grassroots Advisers (GRAs) may also apply for the special parking label, after first purchasing a HDB season parking label. GRAs are not eligible for the P1 registration or HDB schemes mentioned above."
thermal comfort as pre-requisite for air-conditioned spaces,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for National Development whether BCA will consider setting the criteria of thermal comfort as a pre-requisite requirement for air-conditioned spaces in all new and existing non-residential buildings including commercial, industrial and institutional buildings as part of its Green Mark Award certification schemes.","Mr Lawrence Wong: The Green Mark certification scheme was launched in 2005 to shape a greener and more sustainable built environment. The scheme allows developers to evaluate and benchmark their buildings to established environmental performance standards. There are both pre-requisite and voluntary criteria in the certification process.Under the revised Green Mark certification scheme of 2015, designing for thermal comfort is now a pre-requisite for certification for all new non-residential buildings. This includes commercial, industrial, and institutional buildings. The specifications for thermal comfort are based on the Singapore Standards on air-conditioning and mechanical ventilation in buildings.Thermal comfort is currently a voluntary criterion for existing non-residential buildings applying for Green Mark certification today. BCA is reviewing the scheme and will consult industry stakeholders for their views.Ultimately, how comfortable the indoor environment is depends on how the building is operated. We encourage building owners and managers to be responsive to the needs of their tenants and dwellers."
reconstruction of novena pedestrian underpasses,"Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Transport (a) what are the options to reconstruct the two Novena pedestrian underpasses as part of the North-South Corridor project given that the existing underpasses are set to be demolished; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider improving the reconstructed underpasses or linkways to make it more user-friendly to the elderly, disabled and parents with strollers.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The existing two underpasses connect Goldhill Centre to Novena MRT Station, and Revenue House to Novena Square respectively. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) will be reconstructing them to connect all four locations. This will be an improvement over today’s situation. LTA will also be installing lifts at the entrances and exits of the reconstructed underpasses."
nuisance posed by chironomids from pandan reservoir,Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what additional measures will the Ministry implement to mitigate the nuisance posed by chironomids from the Pandan Reservoir; and (b) how can residents living in the vicinity be updated on these actions and measures taken by PUB.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Chironomids or non-biting midges are a type of flying insects that thrive near water bodies such as canals, ponds and reservoirs. They are a natural part of the aquatic ecosystem and are food for fishes and birds. While they neither bite human beings nor spread any disease, they can pose nuisance when they swarm in large numbers. In recent months, PUB has observed an increase in the emergence of chironomids around the HDB blocks near Pandan Reservoir, largely due to the intermittent hot and wet weather.PUB has been actively monitoring the chironomid population and has stepped up measures to control the population and reduce inconvenience to nearby residents. These include regular removal of chironomid eggs from the reservoir's floating structures; increasing the frequency and dosage of the application of biological liquid larvicide Bti (Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis) from three times to five times per week along the reservoir perimeter to kill chironomid larvae; and increasing the frequency of fogging and misting around the reservoir dyke and surrounding vegetation to kill adult chironomids.In addition, PUB has installed bright spotlights at the Pandan Reservoir pumping station and turned them on at night to attract the adult chironomids and deter them from flying into nearby residential areas. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and adjust our measures accordingly.To keep residents living in the vicinity of Pandan Reservoir informed of the chironomid situation, PUB has recently issued a joint advisory with NEA and the West Coast Town Council on the measures taken by the agencies and actions residents can take within their premises. PUB also conducted a dialogue session with the residents on 28 August 2016 to address their concerns. Educational brochures have also been distributed to the residents around Pandan Reservoir.I would like to assure members and the residents that PUB will continue to put in their best efforts to reduce the inconvenience caused by chironomids. Having said that, we may not be able to completely eradicate the chironomids, as they are a part of the natural aquatic ecosystem. Therefore, we also seek residents' understanding and tolerance, should they find these harmless chironomids in their homes."
security measures for primary and secondary schools in light of growing terror threat,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Acting Minister for Education (Schools) (a) what are the security measures in place in primary and secondary schools in light of the growing threat of terrorism; (b) whether students and employees of schools are equipped with knowledge on how to react in the event of an unexpected attack; and (c) what are the Ministry's plans to continue enhancing security in schools especially during after-school hours.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: The Ministry of Education (MOE) places great emphasis on the security and well-being of students and staff in our schools. A three-pronged security approach is adopted. First, schools are fenced and equipped with CCTV surveillance systems and gate barriers manned by security officers to control access. Second, there are security protocol and procedures to regulate movement within the schools. Third, the school maintains close partnerships with the neighbourhood police and the community at large.School staff and students are reminded to be vigilant and alert the authorities in the event of any suspicious activities or intruders. The Police also engage schools and communities through outreach programmes and disseminate security-related advisories.These school security measures are appropriately calibrated to the overall security environment of the country based on the threat assessment provided by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). MOE routinely reviews our security measures for effectiveness to ensure the robustness of our school security measures.The effort to prepare schools for emergencies has been put in place for some time now since 1990s. It is part of the national programme to prepare for civil emergencies and contingencies.All schools have a School Emergency Structure to deal with emergencies to respond, recover and restore the situation back to normalcy. School leaders, staff and students do take part in regular emergency training exercises to practise how to handle emergency situations in the school, including security incidents. The Police and SCDF are also involved in such training exercises and drills, and there is a robust relationship between the schools and the communities for effective collaboration in emergency responses.Ultimately, the key to addressing the growing security threats lies in greater community vigilance. Safety and security is a shared responsibility and each of us has a role to play. MOE will continue to review and update our school security and emergency plans, and to work with the Police and MHA to deter terrorist or criminal activity in our schools, and to respond effectively."
pre-employment tuberculosis screening for pre-school staff,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what are the courses of action when a potential teacher or staff tests positive for tuberculosis (TB) during pre-employment screening; (b) what are the precautionary measures that affected and non-affected schools or child care centres should take; and (c) what is the potential for TB spreading in schools or child care centres given exposure to an infected person.,"Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: Under the Child Care Centres Regulations, new staff members need to undergo a chest X-ray and be certified to be free from active tuberculosis by a registered medical practitioner before they can start work in centres. Centres are also advised to monitor for any persistent coughing among their staff members and children to allow for early diagnosis and treatment.Child care centres are required by law to immediately report any known or suspected tuberculosis cases to parents of all children enrolled in their child care centre, a health officer, and the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA). Similar precautionary measures are implemented in schools, which are required to pre-screen their staff before they start work, and report known tuberculosis cases to the Ministry of Education (MOE).Upon diagnosing a case of active tuberculosis, the Tuberculosis Control Unit conducts free contact tracing among children and staff members to identify those at risk of contracting tuberculosis. These individuals will then be offered free tuberculosis screening. The Ministry of Health also notifies ECDA and MOE of cases in child care centres and schools respectively. Meanwhile, staff members who test positive for active tuberculosis are not permitted to enter the child care centre or school until they are certified to be fit for return by a registered medical practitioner.Child care centres and schools can continue operations as long as they exclude persons who show symptoms of tuberculosis, such as persistent coughing, from their centres.Persons without symptoms do not pose further risk of infection to others. Most persons with the latent form of tuberculosis also do not develop the infectious form. Furthermore, persons with active tuberculosis rapidly become non-infectious once they start their treatment. In any case, persons with symptoms cannot transmit the disease through activities, such as sharing utensils or hand shaking. Transmission is limited to close and prolonged contact with persons showing symptoms of tuberculosis.Child care centres and schools generally abide by the precautionary measures and regulatory safeguards. They also work closely with the Tuberculosis Control Unit, and ECDA or MOE to ensure the safety of children."
practice by managed care companies for doctors to pay administrative fees for referral of patients,"Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the Singapore Medical Council is aware that some managed care companies require doctors to pay administrative fees for the ""referral"" of patients and, if so, what is their response; and (b) whether this practice will result in patients having to pay more.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Managed care has been a feature of our healthcare landscape for many years. Managed care companies serve to provide intermediary services to various stakeholders such as insurers, corporations, healthcare providers and patients.In recent months, the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Singapore Medical Council (SMC) have received feedback from individual doctors and the Singapore Medical Association (SMA) regarding managed care companies, or third party administrators (TPAs), entering into contracts with doctors, where the doctor would commit to pay a fee for each patient referred by the TPA.This raises concerns that TPA's decisions on patient referral may be influenced by the fee arrangement rather than the interest of the patients. The doctor may in turn pass on the cost of the referral fee to the patient through higher charges. In some cases, the patient may not be aware of this, especially if his bills are fully covered by his insurance plan or employee benefits. It is of particular concern if the fee is determined as a percentage of the doctor’s charges, without relation to the actual services rendered by the TPA.The SMC is revising its current Ethical Code and Ethical Guidelines, which already addresses fee-sharing between doctors, to also address fee-sharing between doctors and TPAs. The revised guidelines will explicitly state that doctors must not allow financial arrangements in managed care to lead to any compromise in the care of the patient.MOH is also working with the medical professional bodies and associations to raise doctors' awareness of appropriate arrangements with TPAs. We will continue to work with the Life Insurance Association to remind the Integrated Shield Plan (IP) insurers to ensure that their appointed TPAs, if any, should not have any conflict of interest and should disclose to policyholders any financial arrangements they have with the doctor."
reviewing provision of plastic bags at retail shops,"Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether the Government will consider prohibiting shops, supermarkets and sales outlets from providing free plastic bags in order to minimise their usage and reduce the harmful impact they have on our environment.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Plastic bags are of particular concern in countries where waste is landfilled, resulting in the plastic bags remaining in the landfill for a long time, or finding their way into water bodies or the sea, affecting marine life and food sources. In Singapore, this effect is minimised as all incinerable waste, including plastic bags, are incinerated safely at our waste-to-energy plants before they are landfilled as ash.Notwithstanding this, my Ministry upholds the approach of avoiding excessive consumption of plastic bags to reduce waste generation and carbon emissions. We encourage shoppers to take only what plastic bags they need and to re-use them to bag household trash. We also encourage the habitual use of reusable bags as much as possible. Stakeholders such as retailers also play a role in encouraging and educating consumers to bring their own bags and reduce the use of plastic bags. One example is IKEA which does not provide free disposable plastic bags for its shoppers.My Ministry will continue to look into additional ways to reduce the excessive consumption of plastic bags. Last month, the National Environment Agency called for a tender to study how different types of single-use carriers compare in terms of cost and impact on the environment. The study will better inform our policies on how to guide the use of different types of bags in future."
subsidised or free health screening packages under medishield life,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry will consider providing subsidised or free health screening packages for the insured under MediShield Life.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Evidence-based health screening plays an important role in helping individuals to detect chronic diseases early for prompt treatment. Since 2014, the Health Promotion Board has partnered GP clinics under the Screen for Life programme to provide free screening tests and subsidies for follow-up consultations for Pioneers and Community Health Assist Scheme cardholders.In addition, community health screenings are conducted by our Regional Health Systems. For example, the Eastern Health Alliance provides residents in the East with community health screenings and lifestyle management programmes. Healthcare workers will follow up with patients with abnormal test results to help them with their chronic disease management.As subsidised health screenings are widely available for different groups of Singaporeans, there are no plans to include these under MediShield Life which is a basic health insurance scheme to help pay for large hospital bills and selected outpatient treatments. We need to balance the scope of coverage and amount of benefits with premium affordability.As part of the War on Diabetes, MOH is reviewing the Screen for Life programme to encourage and support more Singaporeans in the target groups to undergo evidence-based screening, and importantly, to follow-up with a doctor if they have any abnormal screening results."
impact of indonesia's plan to stop its foreign domestic workers from living in singaporean employers' homes,"Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Manpower in view of Indonesia's plans to supply new foreign domestic workers (FDWs) on the condition that they do not have to live together with the employers (a) how will this position affect the supply of Indonesian FDWs to Singapore; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider abolishing the $5,000 security bond for such live-out FDWs.","Mr Lim Swee Say: The Indonesian authorities have not formally informed MOM of its plans for non-live in FDWs. Our employment agencies have also not reported disruption to the supply of live-in foreign domestic workers (FDWs) from Indonesia. We continue to welcome Indonesian FDWs into Singapore.The Security Bond (SB) applies to employers of FDWs, as well as foreign workers. It is to ensure that employers and workers comply with Work Permit conditions and is not tied to the live-in requirement. Hence, the issue of abolishing the security bond for non-live in FDWs does not arise.Apart from Indonesia, there are currently 11 other approved sources of FDWs1. MOM will continue to monitor the adequacy of our FDW supply."
considerations behind decision to convert coupon parking to electronic parking systems in housing estates,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for National Development what are the considerations and deliberations behind the decision to convert coupon parking to electronic parking systems within residential neighbourhoods.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The electronic parking system (EPS) was initially implemented at all car parks serving Neighbourhood Centres and Town Centres to better manage the high parking demand, and thus far, it has been effective in doing so.With a per-minute charging structure, the EPS is also a fairer system as motorists will pay for the actual duration of parking, instead of half hour blocks if they use parking coupons. Furthermore, it is more convenient for motorists as they are informed when a car park is full so that they can park in another location.While there are upfront capital costs in setting up EPS at car parks, on average, the EPS has resulted in cost savings of 25% in the of daily operating costs of car parks as compared to the coupon parking system. With the benefits cited above, HDB will be implementing EPS at all residential car parks where it is feasible to do so."
new benchmark for madrasahs under new psle scoring system,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Acting Minister for Education (Schools) what will be the new benchmark set for the six madrasahs under the new PSLE scoring system.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: The basis of the benchmark for madrasahs remains unchanged under the new PSLE scoring system. It is pegged to the average PSLE Score of Malay pupils in the six lowest-performing national primary schools who take four Standard-level subjects.Since we announced the new PSLE scoring system last month, MOE has engaged school leaders, including the principals of the four full-time madrasahs offering primary-level education, to explain the new scoring system. We will continue to work with MCCY and MUIS to ensure that any queries or concerns that the madrasahs may have are adequately addressed."
rationale for alternative ownership model for changi airport terminal 5,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Transport (a) why is there a need for the Ministry to explore alternative ownership models for Changi Airport Terminal 5; (b) what are the lessons learnt from the private public partnership model of the Sports Hub; and (c) whether there is a planned solution should the selected ownership model not work well.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The development of Terminal 5 is a major investment to ensure that Changi Airport continues to remain competitive and serve Singapore's growing economic and connectivity needs. At full capacity, Terminal 5 will be as large as Terminals 1, 2 and 3 combined. Given the scale of investment needed, the Government set up the Changi Airport Development Fund to help fund the building of Terminal 5.For Terminals 1-4, Singapore's sole airport operator Changi Airport Group (CAG) is also the owner. However, there are other leading airports where operation and ownership are separate. MOT and MOF have therefore commissioned a study to determine the ownership model for Terminal 5 following its completion that can best support our objective of maintaining Changi Airport's position as a leading air hub for the long term. We are not, however, considering a public-private partnership model of co-development."
unjust termination of employment for employees diagnosed with tuberculosis,Dr Tan Wu Meng asked the Minister for Manpower what measures are put in place to protect employees diagnosed with tuberculosis from unjust termination of employment.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: Under the Employment Act and the Industrial Relations Act, employees and union members in unionised companies respectively, can appeal to MOM for reinstatement if they have been unfairly dismissed.Employees suspected with tuberculosis should seek treatment early and declare their condition to their employer. This will allow appropriate public health measures to be implemented swiftly, and minimise the risk of transmission of tuberculosis at the workplace and to the public.In instances where employees have been diagnosed with tuberculosis, employers should treat their employees fairly and with compassion. This will also encourage employees who may have contracted tuberculosis, or any other infectious disease, to seek treatment early. Employees too, should be responsible and adhere to the treatment regime for tuberculosis so that they do not suffer a relapse and spread the infection.According to international guidelines, with treatment, employees with tuberculosis can become medically fit for work within two weeks and will not spread the infection to their colleagues or customers at the workplace. Employees who feel they have been unfairly dismissed can approach MOM for assistance."
popularity of pre-fabricated construction in building industry,Mr Alex Yam asked the Minister for National Development (a) what has been the overall take-up rate for pre-fabricated construction in the building industry for (i) the public sector and (ii) the private sector; (b) what have been the key benefits of the Prefabricated Prefinished Volumetric Construction (PPVC) method; and (c) how will the Ministry be helping the industry to transit into pre-fabrication over the next few years.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: In prefabricated construction, on-site construction activities are shifted to factories off-site. Components that are prefabricated in the factory are then transported to work sites for installation. This approach is called Design for Manufacturing and Assembly or DfMA. Prefabrication technologies from the DfMA spectrum include structural steel, Prefabricated Bathroom Units, Mass Engineered Timber, and Prefabricated Prefinished Volumetric Construction or PPVC.The overall take up rate for prefabricated construction has been increasing. In the last three years (from 2013-2015) for example, the prefabrication level for public sector projects, in terms of constructed floor area, has increased from 30% to almost 50%. In tandem, the prefabrication level for private sector projects doubled from around 10% to around 20%.This is a positive development because DfMA technologies result in significant manpower savings, shorter construction times, improved workmanship, and reduced dis-amenity to residents. One recent example is the Crowne Plaza Hotel Expansion project at Changi Airport. By using PPVC, the project achieved 40% on-site manpower savings and a three month reduction in construction time.However, we recognise that using new technologies comes with a steep learning curve and a cost premium. So under the Construction Productivity Roadmap, we have taken a multi-pronged approach to build up the DfMA ecosystem and help industry with this transition.(a) First, we are generating lead demand for these technologies through incorporating these building methods in public sector projects, and stipulating certain productivity requirements in government land sales. For example, at selected GLS sites, we have required at least 65% of the applicable floor area to be constructed using PPVC.(b) Second, we are building up our supply capacity by increasing our local production capability and bringing in qualified overseas suppliers;(c) Third, we are easing regulatory hurdles to facilitate the adoption of innovative and productive technologies;(d) Finally, through the Construction Productivity and Capability Fund (CPCF), we will continue to incentivise the adoption of DfMA technologies and encourage industry practitioners to build up their manpower capabilities.Taken together, these measures should drive down the cost premium by achieving greater economies of scale while reducing impediments to DfMA adoption. Ultimately, we hope to see the industry embrace more prefabrication in the future."
take-up rate for home access plan to aid low-income families with internet connectivity,Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Communications and Information with regard to the Home Access plan which makes Internet connectivity more affordable to the low-income group (a) what is the number of beneficiaries who have been pre-qualified for this plan by reason of them participating in government financial assistance schemes; (b) what percentage of such beneficiaries have signed up for the plan to date; (c) how many households have benefitted from the Home Access plan since its commencement in September 2014; and (d) what further plans does the Ministry have to improve digital inclusion amongst low-income households.,"Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim: Digital inclusion is a priority for my ministry. All Singaporeans must be able to access the opportunities in the digital economy, especially low income households, the elderly, and people with special needs. That is why IDA has implemented digital inclusion programmes for a decade, which have benefited more than 32,000 low-income households.Our Digital Inclusion initiative comprises several programmes, including the Home Access Programme and NEU PC Plus. The Home Access Programme, which Mr Murali Pillai asked about, provides low income families without school-going children with subsidised broadband connectivity and a tablet. So far, 5,000 households have benefited from the Home Access Programme.Mr Murali asked about the number of households which have pre-qualified for this Programme. Over 2,000 households which are on long-term Government assistance schemes have been pre-qualified and notified. To date, 100 of these households are on the Home Access Programme. The rest may not see a need to take up this scheme at this time.The NEU PC Plus Programme is targeted at low income households with school children and persons with disabilities, who may need more support for their schooling and other needs. The Programme provides beneficiaries with a desktop or laptop, and three years of free broadband. These schemes require a small co-payment, but needy families can tap on IDA’s iNSPIRE and defray their co-payment by doing some community service. More than 27,000 low-income households have benefitted from NEU PC Plus.We constantly enhance our schemes to keep pace with the changing infocomm landscape. Earlier this month, I announced two enhancements to the NEU PC Plus programme. First, we raised the monthly household income cap from $3,000 to $3,400. We also raised the per capital monthly income for households with persons with disabilities from $875 to $1,125. These changes have enabled another 5,000 households to benefit from the scheme over the next five years. The second enhancement makes provision to allow special education students already on financial assistance to receive a subsidy of up to 75% more easily. Previously, there would be an assessment on whether their subsidies are pegged at up to 50% or 75%. Now, they would qualify for the up to 75% directly."
security measures for primary and secondary schools in light of growing terror threat,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Acting Minister for Education (Schools) (a) what are the security measures in place in primary and secondary schools in light of the growing threat of terrorism; (b) whether students and employees of schools are equipped with knowledge on how to react in the event of an unexpected attack; and (c) what are the Ministry's plans to continue enhancing security in schools especially during after-school hours.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: The Ministry of Education (MOE) places great emphasis on the security and well-being of students and staff in our schools. A three-pronged security approach is adopted. First, schools are fenced and equipped with CCTV surveillance systems and gate barriers manned by security officers to control access. Second, there are security protocol and procedures to regulate movement within the schools. Third, the school maintains close partnerships with the neighbourhood police and the community at large.School staff and students are reminded to be vigilant and alert the authorities in the event of any suspicious activities or intruders. The Police also engage schools and communities through outreach programmes and disseminate security-related advisories.These school security measures are appropriately calibrated to the overall security environment of the country based on the threat assessment provided by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). MOE routinely reviews our security measures for effectiveness to ensure the robustness of our school security measures.The effort to prepare schools for emergencies has been put in place for some time now since 1990s. It is part of the national programme to prepare for civil emergencies and contingencies.All schools have a School Emergency Structure to deal with emergencies to respond, recover and restore the situation back to normalcy. School leaders, staff and students do take part in regular emergency training exercises to practise how to handle emergency situations in the school, including security incidents. The Police and SCDF are also involved in such training exercises and drills, and there is a robust relationship between the schools and the communities for effective collaboration in emergency responses.Ultimately, the key to addressing the growing security threats lies in greater community vigilance. Safety and security is a shared responsibility and each of us has a role to play. MOE will continue to review and update our school security and emergency plans, and to work with the Police and MHA to deter terrorist or criminal activity in our schools, and to respond effectively."
accreditation and licensing of psychologists and psychotherapists,Ms K Thanaletchimi asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry will consider accreditation and licensing of the psychologist profession and the setting up of professional standards so that the interest of Singaporeans seeking such services is safeguarded.,"39 Ms K Thanaletchimi asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry will consider accreditation and licensing of the psychotherapist profession and the setting up of professional standards so that the interest of Singaporeans seeking such services is safeguarded.Mr Gan Kim Yong: The registration of clinical psychologists and other allied health professionals is provided for under the Allied Health Professions Act. Since 2013, we have registered occupational therapists, physiotherapists, speech-language therapists and from April this year, diagnostic radiographers and radiation therapists.Psychologists' practices cover a wide range of job roles and settings beyond healthcare. For example, there are also educational psychologists, social psychologists, counselling psychologists and organisational and occupational psychologists. Given this wide range, we are studying in greater detail the issue of accrediting and licensing clinical psychologists. We are currently engaging the stakeholders to address such issues.In comparison, Psychotherapy is broadly used for mental health therapy, marriage and family therapy and other personal social problems. Health care professionals such as psychiatrists, psychologists, medical social workers and nurses can apply psychotherapy or a form of it in their course of work. It is also used in non-health care related counselling. Psychotherapy is thus less well-defined and given its use across different groups and in different life situations and settings, it would be impractical to regulate the practice of psychotherapy currently.The Singapore Psychological Society and the Association of Psychotherapists and Counsellors have voluntary membership for psychologists and psychotherapists in Singapore. These organisations have published their own standards e.g. a code of ethics to guide their members and membership criteria."
action against anti-social neighbours,"Mr Darryl David asked the Minister for National Development what action can be taken towards recalcitrant HDB residents who create persistent problems for their neighbours such as noise pollution, hoarding, cluttering public areas, poor environmental hygiene and disrupting the peace.","Mr Lawrence Wong: The approach to take depends on the nature of the issue involved. If there are clear regulatory breaches by these ""recalcitrant residents"", then it is best to approach the relevant agency. For instance, if the issue is over obstruction of the common corridor, and there is a clear breach of the rules, then residents can approach the Town Councils. If it is a case of smoking or littering, then NEA will enforce. Or if it is a case of hoarding, then HDB officers will step in to carry out inspections, and if the hoarding is assessed to be excessive, HDB will ask the residents to remove the unwanted items.Sometimes, the anti-social behaviours may not be regulatory breaches but involve private disputes between neighbours. In such cases, we want as much as possible for the individuals concerned to take responsibility and ownership of their own issues. They should first speak to each other and strive to resolve the matter amicably. If the issue cannot be resolved, disputants can seek help from a neutral third party, such as a grassroots leader to facilitate resolution. Such intervention or informal mediation goes a long way to prevent simple conflicts from escalating further.Should informal mediation be unsuccessful, the case can be referred to the Community Mediation Centre (CMC) for mediation. Where the cases involve long-standing and intractable disputes between neighbours, the aggrieved parties can bring a claim to the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals as a last resort."
singapore's financial contribution to support syrian refugees,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether the Ministry will consider increasing Singapore's financial contribution to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in order to provide more support to Syrian refugees in light of the escalating humanitarian crisis unfolding in Syria.,"Dr Vivian Balakrishnan: Mr Ng asked whether the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would consider increasing Singapore’s financial contribution to the Office of UN High Commissioner for Refugees, or UNHCR, in order to provide more support to Syrian refugees in light of the ongoing Syrian conflict.Singapore commends the UNHCR, and other humanitarian organisations, for their tremendous efforts to save lives in Syria in challenging conditions.As I said in this House in January this year, Singapore will continue to support the work of the UNHCR and humanitarian groups as they seek to alleviate the suffering of the Syrian people.Singapore has been providing voluntary financial contributions to the UNHCR annually. We are not a major donor but a small country with limited resources. But as a responsible global citizen, we have increased our contributions to the UNHCR this year from US$50,000 to US$60,000. This is in recognition of the acute demands placed on the UNHCR, not just in Syria, but all around the world. Our contribution is comparable to those made by other ASEAN countries.The Syrian conflict is now into its sixth year. More than 400,000 Syrians have been killed. There are now more than 4.8 million Syrian refugees, and millions of internally displaced.The key actors in this conflict have acknowledged that the only way to end this conflict is to reach a political solution. We hope they can achieve this as soon as possible while ensuring the safety of civilians and that humanitarian assistance reaches those in need."
benefits and allowances for grassroots leaders and advisers,"Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth what are the past and current benefits given to grassroots leaders and advisers in terms of housing priority, primary school admission, allowance, and other benefits in kind.","Mr Chan Chun Sing (for the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth): Grassroots Leaders (GRLs) are volunteers who serve the community actively. They help bond residents to weave our social fabric; gather feedback for government to improve our policies and services; and they help to close the last mile in our policy communications and delivery.The Government recognises GRLs' contributions and facilitates their community work. Information on these schemes has been provided during previous Parliament sittings and has also been made available online separately.To facilitate their work, like engaging residents and conducting community activities, GRLs may apply for a special parking label after first purchasing a HDB season parking label. This label allows them to park at designated car parks up to 11 pm in the constituency they serve.Eligible GRLs can apply for P1 registration for their children under Phase 2B in schools within the constituency they reside in. This is similar to school and parent volunteers. Eligible GRLs can apply for BTO flats and ECs under a HDB scheme. These long serving GRLs typically help to bond the new communities in the new estates. These schemes recognise the GRLs' contributions to community building and provide platforms for them to continue strengthening their community services.To facilitate their work in their constituencies, Grassroots Advisers (GRAs) may also apply for the special parking label, after first purchasing a HDB season parking label. GRAs are not eligible for the P1 registration or HDB schemes mentioned above."
thermal comfort as pre-requisite for air-conditioned spaces,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for National Development whether BCA will consider setting the criteria of thermal comfort as a pre-requisite requirement for air-conditioned spaces in all new and existing non-residential buildings including commercial, industrial and institutional buildings as part of its Green Mark Award certification schemes.","Mr Lawrence Wong: The Green Mark certification scheme was launched in 2005 to shape a greener and more sustainable built environment. The scheme allows developers to evaluate and benchmark their buildings to established environmental performance standards. There are both pre-requisite and voluntary criteria in the certification process.Under the revised Green Mark certification scheme of 2015, designing for thermal comfort is now a pre-requisite for certification for all new non-residential buildings. This includes commercial, industrial, and institutional buildings. The specifications for thermal comfort are based on the Singapore Standards on air-conditioning and mechanical ventilation in buildings.Thermal comfort is currently a voluntary criterion for existing non-residential buildings applying for Green Mark certification today. BCA is reviewing the scheme and will consult industry stakeholders for their views.Ultimately, how comfortable the indoor environment is depends on how the building is operated. We encourage building owners and managers to be responsive to the needs of their tenants and dwellers."
new benchmark for madrasahs under new psle scoring system,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Acting Minister for Education (Schools) what will be the new benchmark set for the six madrasahs under the new PSLE scoring system.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: The basis of the benchmark for madrasahs remains unchanged under the new PSLE scoring system. It is pegged to the average PSLE Score of Malay pupils in the six lowest-performing national primary schools who take four Standard-level subjects.Since we announced the new PSLE scoring system last month, MOE has engaged school leaders, including the principals of the four full-time madrasahs offering primary-level education, to explain the new scoring system. We will continue to work with MCCY and MUIS to ensure that any queries or concerns that the madrasahs may have are adequately addressed."
workplace safety for female employees of child-bearing age,"Ms K Thanaletchimi asked the Minister for Manpower with regard to female employees of childbearing age, including pregnant or breastfeeding mothers (a) whether special emphasis can be made in the Workplace Safety and Health Act to ensure that companies consider the safety of these employees at the workplace when conducting risk assessment; (b) whether the Approved Code of Practice on Workplace Safety and Health Risk Management can be further strengthened to safeguard them from risks that may arise from working conditions or physical, biological, psychological or chemical agents; and (c) whether the law can provide for suitable alternative jobs for them where their workplace safety and health cannot be satisfactorily managed.","Mr Lim Swee Say: Ensuring workplace safety and health is an important priority for MOM. The Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Act sets the legal framework for the regulation of WSH in Singapore. It is supported by Approved Codes of Practice that set the expected minimum standards and WSH Guidelines that recommend measures to address specific risks. Currently the Act already requires companies to take reasonably practicable measures to ensure the health and safety of all persons at the workplace. Section 4(2)(b) of the WSH Act also provides that ""any reference to the health of a person shall, where that person is pregnant, include a reference to the health of any unborn child that the person is carrying"".The Approved Code of Practice on WSH Risk Management was introduced in 2011 to establish standards that companies are expected to adopt when managing workplace risks. It was enhanced in 2015 to require employers to consider individual health risk factors. This change means that if there are special risks to female employees of childbearing age, including pregnant or lactating mothers, reasonable risk mitigation measures must be put in place. WSH Guidelines were also developed to deal with more specific situations. For example, the WSH Guideline on Statutory Medical Examinations recommends that pregnant and lactating employees not be assigned jobs with exposure to certain hazards like lead, arsenic and benzene.The Act expects employers to take reasonably practicable measures to eliminate or mitigate risks for pregnant and lactating employees by providing adequate arrangement for their welfare at work. Hence, employers should consider providing alternative job assignments where appropriate.MOM requires employers to provide safe and healthy workplaces for all employees, including pregnant and lactating employees. MOM will take actions against employers who fail to do so."
possibility of fare reduction with new operating models for public transport,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the Public Transport Council (PTC) will consider a reduction of public transport fares in the next annual fare review; and (b) whether there will be a review of the fare formula in view of the recent changes to the operating models of public transport.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Based on the fare formula, I expect the Public Transport Council, or PTC, to consider a maximum fare reduction of 5.7% for the upcoming fare exercise. This fare reduction quantum is due to the sharp fall in energy prices over the last year. However, we should note that energy prices can be volatile and may rebound sharply in the following years.The current fare formula, which was introduced in 2013, is valid for five years including for the 2017 fare exercise. It will be reviewed before its expiry next year.I do not wish to pre-judge PTC's future deliberations on this. However, I think we should keep in mind that in response to higher commuter expectations, the Government has been rapidly expanding our rail network and injecting more buses and trains into the system, and also making costly improvements through restructuring the bus and rail industries. While these initiatives have improved our public transport system significantly, they have and will continue to increase the extent of government subsidies in public transport. For instance, under the Bus Service Enhancement Programme, the Government has committed $1.1 billion over five years. Under bus contracting, the Government will be subsidising about $3.5 to $4 billion in the next five years. Similarly, on the rail side, due to the Government taking over ownership of the operating assets under the New Rail Financing Model, the Government expects to spend over $4 billion on renewing, upgrading and expanding operating assets for the next five years. These will be on top of the $20 billion that the Government has committed to spend on building new rail lines in the same period. We are also requiring the rail operators to invest more heavily in maintenance to raise our rail reliability substantially.In many major cities, public transport is subsidised. However, we need to guard against it becoming an excessive fiscal burden. The new fare formula will have to strike a balance between fiscal prudence and ensuring that fares continue to remain affordable."
use of cpf savings for housing loan for flats with less than 60 years lease,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what measures are in place to ensure that potential property buyers are informed of the limitations on the use of CPF savings when taking a housing loan for flats with a remaining lease of less than 60 years; and (b) what recourse do buyers have if they commit to buying such flats and subsequently find that they are unable to pay for the flats in cash.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: The limitations on the use of CPF savings for HDB flats and private properties with a balance lease of less than 60 years were put in place to protect the recoverable value of CPF savings used for housing purchases.The Central Provident Fund Board (CPFB) and the Housing and Development Board (HDB) have put in place several measures to inform and advise prospective flat buyers on these CPF limitations.CPF Board's website provides an online calculator, e-brochure, and a set of 'Frequently Asked Questions' to help prospective property buyers compute the maximum amount of CPF savings that they can use for shorter lease properties. They can also approach CPF Board for this information.For prospective buyers purchasing flats directly from HDB, HDB provides them with a Financial Plan during the flat selection process. This Financial Plan also explains the CPF withdrawal limits for flats with balance leases of less than 60 years, which are sold under HDB's Sale of Balance Flats exercises, if any.For prospective buyers purchasing resale flats in the open market, they are required by HDB to complete and submit a 'Resale Checklist' which highlights the need to check the balance lease of the flat, and which informs them that there may be limits on the use of CPF savings for shorter lease flats. Those who choose to engage the services of a salesperson can consult the salesperson on the relevant rules and procedures governing the use of CPF funds.The HDB website also highlights these CPF limitations as part of their e-resources on financial planning.For individuals who have purchased shorter lease flats and subsequently face short term financial difficulty in servicing their remaining HDB housing loan in cash, HDB may assist deserving cases temporarily with their instalment payment and loan arrears on a case-by-case basis."
list of registered medical practitioners who are lasting power of attorney certificate issuers,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Social and Family Development whether the Ministry will consider publicising the list of registered medical practitioners who are certificate issuers of a Lasting Power of Attorney in each neighbourhood for the convenience of residents particularly senior citizens.,"Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: A Lasting Power of Attorney (or LPA) is a legal document which allows a person who is at least 21 years of age (a 'donor'), to voluntarily appoint another person (a 'donee') to make decisions on his behalf when he loses mental capacity. When completing a LPA, the LPA Form must be witnessed and certified by an LPA Certificate Issuer. The purpose of the Certificate Issuer is to certify that the donor understands the purpose of the LPA and the scope of the authority conferred under it, as well as ensure that there is no fraud or undue pressure used to induce the donor to create an LPA. A Certificate Issuer can be any one of the following professionals in Singapore, namely a medical practitioner accredited by the Public Guardian, a practising Singapore qualified lawyer, or a registered psychiatrist.As of 31 August 2016, there are 364 medical practitioners accredited as Certificate Issuers. The list of accredited medical practitioners can be found on the Office of the Public Guardian’s (or OPG) website, www.publicguardian.gov.sg. This includes the addresses and contact numbers of their clinics. We recently introduced an updated list which categorises the Certificate Issuers based on the geographic location of their clinics, for easier search of a Certificate Issuer. In addition, the public can call in to the OPG helpline for assistance on identifying the accredited doctors in their vicinity.Currently, all accredited doctors are issued with an accreditation letter informing them of their appointment as well as an ""LPA Accredited Certificate Issuer"" decal. These accredited doctors are encouraged to display the decal at their clinic, as this will serve to increase the visibility of Certificate Issuers around the various neighbourhoods."
legal and policy distinction between legitimate and illegitimate children,"Mr Kok Heng Leun asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) which are the areas in law, policy and decision-making by Government agencies and schools, that make a distinction between ""legitimate"" and ""illegitimate"" children; and (b) what are the differences in outcomes for ""legitimate"" and ""illegitimate"" children and their parents in each of these areas.","Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: Government benefits that support the growth and development of children are given to all Singaporean children, regardless of their legitimacy status. All Singaporean children have access to social assistance, education and healthcare subsidies, as well as infant care and child care subsidies. Children of unwed parents born from 1 September 2016 are also now eligible for Child Development Account (CDA) benefits. This further supports unwed parents' efforts to care for their child, and enhance the child outcomes.A child’s right to be maintained by his or her parent is also laid out in the Women's Charter. Under the Charter, parents are obliged to provide accommodation, clothing, food and education to their children, taking into account their means and regardless of the child's legitimacy status.Having said that, an illegitimate child will not acquire citizenship by birth if his mother is not a citizen of Singapore. He will not be eligible for the Baby Bonus cash gift and his mother cannot enjoy tax reliefs which are provided in respect of children born within marriage. In the area of inheritance, an illegitimate child would inherit a part or the whole of his mother's estate if the mother dies intestate with no surviving legitimate children. Similarly, the mother would inherit a part or the whole of her illegitimate child's estate if she is living when the child dies intestate. Parents who want to leave something for their illegitimate child should make a Will.Where benefits or laws differentiate on legitimacy status, they reflect the Government's desire to promote strong marriages. Parenthood within marriage is the desired and prevailing social norm, which we want to continue to promote as this is key to having strong families."
complaints of foul smell during rubbish collections,"Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for National Development (a) for the past three years, how many complaints has HDB received from residents on foul odours emitted during rubbish chute collections; (b) how have these complaints been resolved; and (c) what plans are there to introduce the Pneumatic Waste Conveyance System to Sembawang GRC.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Town Councils (TCs) manage and maintain the common areas in HDB estates, including rubbish chutes. If there is any feedback on foul odours emitted during refuse collection, HDB would generally refer them to TCs for their follow-up. However, HDB has not received such feedback over the past three years.While it is inevitable that some odour may be emitted during the refuse collection process, TCs take care to minimise dis-amenity to residents. For example, the rubbish bin chutes and central refuse chute are washed on a regular basis, and after each collection. Once the collection at the central refuse chute is completed, the surrounding areas would be cleaned and the roller door shut, to minimise odours being emitted. TCs also remind their conservancy workers to cover the rubbish bins while they are being transported.HDB has implemented the Pneumatic Waste Conveyance System (PWCS) in selected new HDB developments where feasible, including Tampines North, Punggol, Bidadari and Sengkang. HDB will be studying the feasibility of implementing PWCS in other new housing estates.For existing estates, implementing PWCS is more challenging and expensive as it involves carrying out services diversion and extensive excavation works to lay the underground pipes in built-up areas. HDB will have to assess the performance of the PWCS currently test-bedded in Yuhua, before deciding whether to roll out the PWCS in other existing estates."
hdb's mechanised parking system at three sites,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for National Development in respect of HDB's Mechanised Parking System (MPS) at the three MPS sites in Changi Village, Bangkit Road and Yishun Ave 4 respectively (a) what are the utilisation rates of these carparks; (b) how long does a driver have to wait to retrieve the car during peak and non-peak periods; and (c) what are the breakdown rates of each MPS and maintenance costs involved.","Mr Lawrence Wong: The average utilisation rate for HDB's Mechanised Parking System (MPS) at the three sites during peak period is about 80%.Based on HDB's parking records, motorists took an average of five minutes to park or retrieve their vehicles during off-peak periods. The time taken for peak period parking or retrieval varies between 10 and 15 minutes, depending on the number of vehicles in the queue.This compares favourably with the parking situation prior to the implementation of MPS. For example, at Changi Village, motorists used to take more than 30 minutes to queue and find a parking lot during peak periods.Like all new mechanical systems, the MPS requires a run-in period where minor glitches are experienced and fine-tuning of the system is necessary. But if we look over the past six months, out of about 54,000 parking transactions, the breakdown rate is a low 0.02% (or 11 incidences in all). These arose mainly due to user-related issues, such as motorists forgetting to apply their parking brakes. The maintenance cost per MPS lot ranges from $60 to $100 per month."
purchase of second property for hdb flat and private property owners,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for National Development what is the rationale for allowing eligible HDB flat owners to purchase a private property without having to sell their current HDB flat but not allowing private home owners to buy a HDB flat from the open market without them selling their private property within six months.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB flats are meant for owner-occupation. To reinforce this principle, HDB flat owners are not allowed to buy a private residential property during the initial five-year minimum occupation period (MOP).Likewise, private residential property owners who choose to buy a resale flat are also subject to the same MOP condition. Hence, they cannot own a private property during the five-year MOP, and are required to dispose of their private property within six months from the date of the resale flat purchase. This also dampens the demand for resale flats from buyers with no urgent need of housing.Both HDB flat and private property owners are thus treated the same – they are not allowed to own a private residential property during the five-year MOP of the HDB flat. Conversely, after fulfilling the five-year MOP, all HDB flat owners, including those who had previously owned private properties, are allowed to buy private property."
recognition of medical certificates issued by traditional chinese medicine practitioners,"Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Ministry can consider implementing guidelines or legislation to formally recognise medical certificates issued by registered Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners especially for certain ailments such as sprains, back pain, and torn muscles.","Mr Lim Swee Say: Under the Employment Act, all employers are required to grant paid sick leave to employees with Medical Certificates (MCs) issued by a Government medical officer. In addition, employers are also required to grant paid sick leave for MCs issued by private medical practitioners who are registered under the Medical Registration Act (MRA) and are appointed by the company.Some employers, including the Public Service, go beyond the requirements of the Employment Act to grant paid sick leave for MCs issued by private medical practitioners other than those appointed by the company.There were almost 4,000 private medical practitioners registered under the MRA in 2015. Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners can also be registered, subject to approval by the Singapore Medical Council."

abuse and harassment of students in orientation programmes,Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked the Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) in light of increasing incidents of sexually offensive and 'sexualised' activities during orientation activities at the National University of Singapore over the last decade (a) what are the regulations in place to protect students in our tertiary institutions from physical abuse and harassment; (b) whether these regulations are standardised across our polytechnics and universities; (c) what checks and enforcement are in place to ensure that the regulations are adhered to; (d) how many students or staff have been found guilty and have had to face disciplinary action and how were they punished; and (e) whether any civil or criminal suits had been filed as a result.,"2 Mr Zaqy Mohamad asked the Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (a) whether the Ministry has a code of conduct to prohibit sexually inappropriate or degrading activities in institutions of higher learning and schools; (b) what measures have been taken to ensure adequate oversight by university staff on students organising such activities; (c) how many complaints has the Ministry received in the past five years and what actions have been implemented to prevent recurrence; and (d) why safeguards have not been put in place to prevent the recent incident in the National University of Singapore.3 Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) in light of the reports of sexual harassment and abuse during orientation activities at the National University of Singapore (a) whether the Ministry has been monitoring this situation in all our tertiary institutions and keeping track of the number and nature of incidents reported; and (b) whether resources have been provided to our institutions to ensure the safety of our students.4 Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) with regard to the incidents of sexual harassment and physical abuse during orientation activities at the National University of Singapore (a) what are the existing guidelines for orientation activities and whether students/staff have been properly advised and guided; (b) how many complaints on such lewd orientation activities has each of our tertiary institutions received annually in the last 10 years; (c) what measures have been taken by the respective institutions to prevent such abuses by the students or staff who organised the orientation; and (d) how many students or staff have repeatedly been found to be responsible for such orientation activities.Mr Ong Ye Kung: On 26 July 2016, The New Paper (TNP) published an article on sexualised activities which occurred during freshmen orientation at the National University of Singapore (NUS). The reported acts were demeaning, reprehensible, and have no place in a university.NUS immediately made known that it was against such acts, and that it will take strong disciplinary action against those found responsible. Staff met with student leaders involved in orientation camps to remind them of the regulations.On 28 July, a video went viral – it showed students flat on their backs, being dunked in a shallow pond. It raised fresh concerns about orientation activities.Unlike the first TNP report, these are not sexualised activities. It is a tradition in Sheares Hall, observed by students during special occasions such as birthdays, and is not just for freshmen.The longstanding rule in NUS is that ragging of freshmen is strictly prohibited. As a result, NUS decided to suspend student-organised orientation activities. Given the circumstances, I understand and respect NUS’ decision.Our universities have put in place a multitude of rules and processes to regulate and guide orientation activities.At NUS, all student leaders involved in organising and leading orientation activities are briefed and quizzed on orientation dos and don’ts. Banned activities such as ragging are explicitly highlighted both in the briefings and in NUS’s Student Code of Conduct, and the penalties for such behaviour are clearly stated. Student organisers have to submit detailed orientation proposals to be vetted by staff advisors and the Office of Student Affairs – a painstaking process that takes about three to four months. Any inappropriate activities, such as those involving piggybacking between opposite genders, intimate body contact, and wastage of food, will be removed during this process. Orientation-week, or O-week, culminates in the Rag and Flag, where freshmen work together and raised funds for charity. This year, they raised $472,000.As for NTU, it has over the last three years developed a fresh model for freshmen orientation. A University Undergraduate Co-ordinating Committee, which include student union representatives, sets orientation objectives and guidelines, which includes rules against ragging. There is an explicit recognition of the right of freshmen to opt out of any activities. Student organisations then work with respective faculty and staff to organise the activities. Today, freshmen overnight orientation camps are mostly held within campus and not outside, where discretion is wide and problematic practices tend to occur. This break from the past required some getting used to at first, but it is quite well-accepted now.The other universities – SMU, SIT, SUTD – are much smaller in scale and intake numbers. Their orientation activities are therefore much more closely supervised than NUS and NTU.If all these measures are in place, why do inappropriate orientation activities still happen? They happen when staff and faculty are not watching, and when some students decide to deviate from approved plans. Such inappropriate orientation activities happen occasionally – they are certainly not widespread. To answer the specific questions of members, complaints to the university administrations have been very few over the last five years. Neither have any police reports been filed to date, to the best of our knowledge.Amongst NUS students and alumni, there is a range of views on the matter of orientation. Speaking to them, or reading NUS Whispers, a confessional site for students and alumni alike, one will realise that there is a fairly strong view that orientation has been useful for freshmen. This is because orientation is an integral part of the university experience. This is when freshmen are introduced to university life, its curriculum and demands. This is when they make friends, establish networks and forge bonds that may last a lifetime.After the NUS suspension, one alumna, Sarah Tan, who graduated in 2014, wrote to me. She told me that she was totally against the sexualised activities. But she also disagreed with the suspension of orientation activities. While preparing for this reply, I got her permission to quote her explanation in one of her blogs""My life would have been very, very different if not for the camps I joined as a freshie. I would not have met so many amazing people, students, staff and non-NUS folks alike. I would not have had the opportunity to build up such a large network. I would not have overcome my fear of public speaking. And I definitely would not feel that my time in NUS was the best period of my life... O-week is incredibly important for the freshies…""Personal growth is incredibly important. So is personal safety. Bonding is incredibly important. So too is respect for the dignity of others. University campuses are full of energetic young people, independent-minded, who are stepping up to take their place in the world. On top of that there are rules, unspoken norms, and traditions.In this environment, we should not expect to watch their every move, ameliorate every risk, and cushion every eventuality. We want our young to learn, in and outside of the classroom, from successes as well as mistakes. If something goes wrong, we have to correct them, immediately and thoroughly, and NUS is indeed doing so. For those who did wrong, they will have to expect discipline and rebuke. For those who suffered wrong, they have the option to forgive. For the rest, the system did not start from Lord of the Flies, so let us not push it to 1984.That is why when NUS informed me that they intended to put a stop to orientation this year, we discussed and carefully decided that it should only apply to student-organised team-building activities, and that these would be ""suspended"" instead of ""cancelled"" or ""banned"". This is because orientation is fundamentally beneficial for freshmen, and the correct response should be to take this opportunity to improve, right the wrongs, and bring it back later, even after lessons have started. It will not be the same as having O-week, but we owe it to the freshmen of 2016. That is what NUS is planning to do.A last point I would like to address is that as NUS tightens its enforcement against ragging, and as orientation activities evolve, some students are going to lament the loss of certain traditions.There is a Chinese wedding tradition, which is to get a little boy to roll on the bed of the couple the night before the wedding. It is supposed to help the couple bear male offspring. I am not sure many young couples follow that tradition anymore. I am not even sure their parents and grandparents are insisting on it either. Traditional practices do change with the times. But couples still faithfully observe tea ceremonies during customary weddings. Because this is not just a ritual, but it also signifies the true spirit of the tradition – which is respect for our elders, and expressing our gratitude to them.What is the true spirit of NUS? Service to society, excellence, passion and integrity, to be the keys to the world. What is the true spirit of Sheares Hall? It is named after Doctor Benjamin Sheares, our second President, who came from humble origins, excelled in his studies, became a doctor, and pioneered new surgical methods. As President, he was widely respected and was a symbol of Singapore’s unity. These are the true spirit of traditions and values that should live on, and that should be expressed in orientation activities and initiation processes.I wish our universities orientations that will inspire freshmen, and which everyone can be proud of, and remember – for the right reasons."
impact of gic and temasek holdings' lower returns on government's budget and long-term programmes,Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for Finance whether the outlook of lower long-term financial returns as reflected in the annual reports of GIC and Temasek Holdings indicates that the Net Investment Returns Contribution from the financial reserves will be lower going forward and whether that will have an impact upon the Government's ability to balance the overall budget and to fund committed long-term programmes.,"17 Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for Finance (a) whether the Government needs to review its dependence on Net Investment Returns Contributions from Temasek and GIC to fund its budget given the tough investment environment and modest growth prospects; and (b) whether any long-term spending programmes will be affected if long-term returns from both portfolios end up materially lower than in previous periods.Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam: The Net Investment Returns (NIR) framework is based on the expected long-term real rates of return on the reserves invested by GIC, Temasek Holdings, and MAS. The expected long-term rates are used because the NIR framework seeks to smooth out budgetary spending across market cycles - in other words, to ensure we do not overspend in bull markets, or face a shortage of funds during a market downturn.If there were to be a long term deterioration in the investment environment, in other words a secular rather than cyclical deterioration, we would expect a downward adjustment to the expected long-term rates, and hence a lower NIRC to the annual budget. The investment entities and the Government are each studying the possible scenarios for the long term environment. We cannot rule out a scenario of lower expected long-term rates. It is an added reason why the Government has to continue to review both our revenues and expenditures to ensure sustainability.First, even as we recognise the rising needs of an ageing population, we must remain prudent in our spending and emphasise value-for-money in every programme. We must continually transform the delivery of government services to be more productive and innovative in achieving better outcomes.Second, we must continue to build up our revenues for the long term. I should highlight that although the NIRC is a sizeable revenue item, our operating revenues (comprising tax revenues as well as fees and charges) continue to serve as the primary source of our total revenues, at slightly over 80%. Going forward, we must continue to build a revenue structure that allows us to meet important spending needs, while ensuring that we maintain our economic competitiveness as well as keep our overall system of taxes and benefits progressive and fair.Third, and most fundamentally, sustainable government finances depend on whether we have a healthy and growing economy. The recommendations of the Committee on the Future Economy (CFE), and the Industry Transformation Programme that we have embarked on, are key to growing the economy and creating good jobs for our people. This is the key way to grow our revenues sustainably."
crowdfunding as alternative financing for start-ups and smes,"Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Prime Minister how the new licensing regime for crowdfunding platforms announced by MAS is expected to support crowdfunding as an alternative source of financing for start-ups and SMEs as well as ensure schemes under crowdfunding are fair, transparent and protect investors against frauds.","Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): MAS’ new regulatory framework supports securities-based crowdfunding (SCF) as an alternative source of financing for start-ups and SMEs. It does so in two ways.First, MAS has simplified an existing rule that allows companies raising less than $5 milion within 12 months (small offers) to do so without a prospectus. Under the existing rule, SCF platforms assisting companies to raise funds were required to ascertain that investors have the knowledge, experience and are suited for SCF investments. Most retail investors would have difficulties meeting all three requirements. With the simplified rule, SCF platforms need to ascertain that investors meet any one of the three requirements, to be able to have access to SCF investments. It will expand the potential investor pool for SCF investments.Second, MAS will reduce the financial requirements for SCF platforms that raise funds from only accredited and institutional investors, and do not handle customers’ monies1. Both the minimum base capital and operational risk requirements for such intermediaries will be reduced to $50,000 (the previous requirements were $250,000 and $100,000 respectively). The requirement for a $100,000 security deposit will also be removed.But SCF investments are not without risk. MAS’ SCF regulatory framework seeks to strike the right balance between widening access to funding for start-ups and SMEs and protecting investor interests. All SCF platform operators seeking to operate in Singapore will require licensing by MAS. MAS will admit only platform operators that are assessed to be fit and proper. They are required to ensure proper segregation of investors’ monies, and keep proper records of transactions.As a further safeguard for investors, MAS has introduced a new requirement for SCF platform operators that are intermediating small offers to disclose the key risks of SCF investments. These operators will also be required to obtain investors’ acknowledgement that they have read and understood these risks before they can proceed to invest. However, I have to emphasise that SCF investors have to exercise due care and must ultimately bear responsibility for investment risks.SCF operators are expected to deal fairly with investors in the conduct of their business. Where a licensed intermediary is found to have breached MAS’ rules, supervisory measures will be taken, ranging from enhanced audits to revocation of licence."
trend of child abuse cases,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what is the number and trend of child abuse cases that have been reported in the last three years; (b) how many of these cases involve the child having to be hospitalised; (c) how many has led to fatality; (d) what improvements have been made to our structure and processes to detect such cases for early intervention; and (e) whether teachers and the public have been educated or trained to look out for cases of child abuse.,"Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: In 2015, my Ministry’s Child Protective Service investigated 551 cases of child abuse and neglect. This number was higher than the 300 to 400 cases investigated in the previous three years. One reason for this trend is that there is better detection and reporting by professionals such as social workers and teachers, as a result of our investment in strengthening the capabilities of our partners. A second reason is that we have expanded our role and redefined the criteria for assessing when a case would be taken up for investigation.About 20 of the children involved in our investigations last year were admitted to hospital for medical treatment for their injuries. There were two fatalities arising from child abuse between 2013 and 2015.My Ministry has invested in strengthening the capabilities of professionals such as teachers, and healthcare and social workers to detect abuse and intervene appropriately. For instance, we have developed sector-wide guidelines to have clarity and consistency in how professionals would screen for child abuse, and regular training on the use of these guidelines. In schools for instance, teachers will alert school counsellors, and if necessary my Ministry’s Child Protective Service, to provide support to students who show signs of distress or possible abuse.For better detection and early intervention, we have established inter-agency networks, such as the Inter-Ministry Workgroup on Child Protection and put in place clear processes for schools, community agencies and hospitals for reporting suspected abuse.To further reduce the instances of child abuse that go undetected, the Government will continue ongoing efforts in public education and community outreach. Preventing child abuse is everyone’s responsibility. Anyone who is aware of a child being or is at risk of being abused, can help by reporting it."
disputes between foreign workers and employers,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how many disputes have been received involving foreign workers and their employers in the past three years; (b) on average, how long does it take for the Ministry to investigate and resolve a case; (c) what are the options open to either party if they do not find the results of the investigation to be satisfactory; (d) whether there is a deadline after which the employer will not be required to continue paying for the worker's food and accommodation; and (e) what is the longest period so far where a case is unresolved and the employer has to bear the cost of maintaining the worker.","Mr Lim Swee Say: The Employment Act sets out the basic terms of employment including salary and other statutory benefits. Where there are disputes, MOM first attempts to resolve them by mediation. If parties are not satisfied with the outcome, they can have the dispute adjudicated at the Labour Court. In the past three years, MOM received about 4,500 disputes involving foreign workers per year. This represents less than 0.4% of the foreign workforce in Singapore.MOM ensures that all disputes are dealt with expeditiously. The large majority i.e. more than 90% are amicably settled through mediation within one month. The remaining 10% of cases are resolved through adjudication at the Labour Court. Adjudication takes an average of another month to complete. Hence, practically all disputes are resolved within two months from the time the foreign workers surface their disputes to MOM. MOM requires the employers to be responsible for the workers' well-being including the provision of proper food and accommodation, for the duration of the dispute. This ensures that the employer does not unfairly pass on the cost of upkeep to other taxpayers. The state will provide for the upkeep of a worker where necessary, if the worker is required by the state, for example as a prosecution witness or an accused person.The longest case in the last three years took about 10 months to complete as it involved not only a salary dispute but also a criminal breach of the Penal Code, where the employer was also investigated for allegations of salary fraud. The worker involved in that case was given proper upkeep and was also allowed to change employer after two months to continue working in Singapore."
proposal for national emissions trading scheme,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether the Ministry will implement a national emissions trading scheme as an instrument for Singapore to meet its COP21 commitments.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Climate change is a global problem with wide-ranging implications. Many countries around the world today are already feeling the effects whether it is record high temperatures, more intense rainfalls or the threat that rising sea levels bring to coastal cities. Although Singapore only contributes less than 0.2% of the world’s total greenhouse gas emissions, we are a responsible global citizen and will play our part.Given this, Singapore had pledged at the 2015 Paris Climate Conference to reduce our emissions intensity by 36% below 2005 levels by 2030 and to stabilise our emissions with the aim of peaking around 2030. These are ambitious targets which the Government alone cannot achieve. We would require the collective effort and action of every individual, communities and businesses to make greener lifestyle choices and reduce their energy consumption.Members would be aware that the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change (IMCCC), chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean, recently released a Climate Action Plan that explains the Whole-of-Government strategy we have adopted to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, and to protect Singapore from the impacts of climate change. Improving our energy efficiency continues to be a key strategy.Specifically, the Member has asked whether a national emissions trading scheme will be implemented as part of this strategy. In recent years, many countries around the world have implemented various carbon pricing instruments, including emissions trading schemes, to help in their climate change efforts. For example, the Republic of Korea launched its emissions trading scheme in 2015. China, which has seven regional pilots, has also announced its intention to introduce a national cap-and-trade system in 2017.In Singapore, the Government has not made any decision on carbon pricing, including emissions trading schemes."
commitment of new companies in developing strong singapore core,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Trade) how will the Ministry ensure that new companies or investments brought into Singapore are aligned to developing a strong Singapore core and progressive workplace practices.,"Mr Lim Hng Kiang: The Economic Development Board (EDB) adopts a targeted approach to investment promotion, attracting projects that are in line with Singapore’s competitive strengths, as well as our constraints in manpower, land and planned international commitments on carbon emissions, to create good jobs for Singaporeans. From 2011 to 2015, EDB secured commitments of S$65 billion in fixed asset investments. These investments are expected to generate total business expenditure per annum of S$34 billion, value-added per annum of S$77 billion, as well as create 107,000 jobs when fully implemented.The Government works with relevant educational institutions and industry partners to ensure that Singaporeans are equipped with the skills to take up good jobs. This is embodied in the national SkillsFuture movement, which develops an integrated system of education, training and career progression for all Singaporeans, promotes industry support for individuals to advance based on skills, and fosters a culture of lifelong learning. One initiative that encourages employers to develop a Singaporean core is the SkillsFuture Earn and Learn Programme. This is a place-and-train programme for fresh polytechnic and ITE graduates, who are matched with employers and have opportunities to learn through structured on-the-job and institution-based training. This programme equips graduates with industry-relevant skills. Those who successfully complete this programme receive industry-recognised qualifications.The Government also ensures that Singaporeans have a level playing field for good jobs through the Fair Consideration Framework. It sets out clear expectations for all companies to consider Singaporeans fairly for job and career opportunities. In addition, all companies must comply with the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices and have fair employment practices that are open, merit-based and non-discriminatory."
support of community integration activities at condominiums,"Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth whether there are plans to increase efforts or support for community integration activities at condominiums given the rising trend of rental units and permanent residents residing in these compounds.","Mr Chan Chun Sing (for the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth): The People’s Association (PA) promotes social cohesion amongst residents from all races, age groups and socio-economic backgrounds, including both public and private estates.To enable private estate residents to be involved in community activities, PA has helped to facilitate private estate residents to form more Neighbourhood Committees (NCs). There are currently 183 NCs, up from 112 in 2011. We will continue to expand the number of NCs as necessary to deepen their engagement with the wider grassroots network.Besides organising activities and forming interest groups to bring residents together, the NCs also facilitate residents’ involvement in their own communities via the OneConnect Programme. Through this programme, residents can offer suggestions for estate improvement and formulate community solutions to tackle common issues, e.g. to eliminate dengue breeding spots. The NCs also partner various grassroots and community organisations to reach out to the residents, including the less privileged, through various meaningful initiatives.PA also offers many community programmes and courses at the Community Clubs/Centres (CCs) to meet the different interests and needs of residents, including those living in condominiums. All residents are welcome to participate in these activities where they can get to know their neighbours and community better."
review of hdb's joint singles rental scheme to prevent violent disputes,"Dr Lily Neo asked the Minister for National Development (a) in the past year, how many disputes between co-tenants of HDB rental flats resulted in violence; and (b) whether a review should be carried out to improve the Joint Singles Scheme for the rental of HDB flats.","Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB does not keep specific records of disputes among tenants, or whether disputes result in violence. In 2014 and 2015, HDB received 235 requests for a change of tenant due to disputes, out of around 12,000 households under the Joint Singles Scheme (JSS).For disputes which the tenants cannot settle between themselves, HDB will refer them to seek help from grassroots organisations or the Community Mediation Centre. If mediation fails, one or both parties may still submit separate applications to rent another public rental flat with other eligible persons.HDB currently has no plans to review the requirement to pair tenants under the JSS, as it enables HDB to help as many needy singles as possible to have a roof over their heads, within the limited resources for public housing. Most JSS tenants are able to live together amicably and derive benefit from having company. The key is mutual respect and tolerance."
encouraging more adults and elderly to go for vaccinations,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Health (a) what plans does the Ministry have to encourage more adults and the elderly to go for vaccinations in view of local immunisation rates being below 20% for adults and below 10% for those aged 50 to 69; and (b) whether the Ministry can consider allowing Singaporean adults to use Medisave to pay for all types of vaccinations instead of limiting the use of Medisave to the current few types of vaccinations.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: An Expert Committee on Immunisation advises MOH on vaccination. The Committee comprises specialists from public and private healthcare institutions in infectious diseases, microbiology, paediatrics and public health.For adults, the Expert Committee has recommended a targeted approach of influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations in specific high-risk groups. They include seniors aged 65 years and above, and persons with chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, asthma and heart diseases. These patients can use their Medisave to pay for influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations.There is room to improve the vaccination rates in these high risk groups. To achieve this outcome, MOH needs to work together with healthcare professionals and the public to raise awareness, and encourage patients in these high risk groups to go for the recommended vaccinations."
mandatory prolonged break during june school holidays,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Acting Minister for Education (Schools) (a) how many schools adhere to the Ministry's guideline on giving students and school teachers at least a two-week break during the June school holidays; (b) whether the Ministry can review this guideline to at least a three-week break so that students and school teachers can have more time to rest and bond with their families; and (c) whether a limit can be made to the number of hours a day that a student can spend in school for official remedial classes or co-curricular activities during the school holidays.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: The well-being of our teachers is important and we have put in place various initiatives to support their work-life needs. A set of guidelines is provided to schools to support and guide them in managing their teachers’ workload and well-being. One of these guidelines is the provision of protected vacation time during school holidays to ensure that teachers have sufficient time to rest and bond with their families. The baseline protected time in the school vacation comprises at least two days in March, two weeks in June, two days in September and three weeks in November / December.Under the guideline on protected vacation time, teachers are to be given at least two weeks off in the June holidays and this has been observed by all the schools. As this is a baseline provision, schools do, in most cases, give their teachers more than two weeks off in the June holidays. While setting this baseline provision, MOE is mindful of the need to accord schools some flexibility to meet their specific needs, for example, to support teachers' professional development programmes as well as programmes for their students. In principle, schools seek to optimise the holidays to ensure that their teachers get a sufficient break to rest and recharge.Similarly, schools seek to ensure that students are also given adequate time off during the holidays to rest and spend time with their families, and pursue their personal or recreational activities. Unless necessary, students are not required to attend school during the holidays. However, schools may use part of the school holidays to conduct remedial or enrichment classes and Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) for specific groups of students. These activities are planned after due consideration of the students’ learning and developmental needs. For example, the June holidays may be an opportune time for teachers to address students’ learning gaps identified during the mid-year examinations through the provision of small group remediation to those who may benefit from it. Part of the school holidays may also be used to organise activities for CCAs that may not be easily conducted during term time, such as camps and leadership courses.Given that there are different student profiles and needs across the schools, it may not be meaningful to set a limit on the number of hours a student can spend in school during the school holidays that can be universally applied to all students.Nonetheless, we agree that the school holidays are an important time for the students to take a break from school. In planning holiday programmes, our schools are mindful of this and have processes in place to monitor and co-ordinate holiday homework and activities. School holiday programmes are usually not compulsory, and students do have a choice to opt out of them. Schools are also reminded to inform parents of planned school activities early to facilitate their holiday planning.MOE will continue to monitor that schools are judicious in their planning of holiday activities and to be mindful of the students’ and teachers’ need for a restful break during the school holidays. MOE will also continue to engage School Leaders in their review of programmes to maximise vacation time beyond the baseline protected time for teachers and students while striving to meet the developmental needs of teachers and students."
enhancing competency of home team to tackle online crime,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) how is the Ministry training and improving the competency of Home Team officers to collate evidence and tackle online crimes; and (b) whether it is working with the private sector to improve its detection and forensics capabilities.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The Singapore Police Force (SPF) equips its officers with the skills to tackle online crimes, through specialised and structured training programmes.Newly-appointed police officers undergo both theory and hands-on training on how to respond to online crime as part of their basic training programme. Those appointed as Investigation Officers receive additional training on how to search and seize information technology (IT)-related evidence on laptops and mobile devices, and the proper handling of such evidence.Police’s cyber investigations and forensics capabilities have also been strengthened. Last year, Police established a Cybercrime Command in CID to build up capabilities to combat cybercrime. In addition, Cybercrime Response Teams were formed in the six Police Land Divisions to equip frontline units with the necessary investigative and forensic capabilities to deal with cybercrime.To combat e-commerce scams, the Police reach out to organisations such as financial institutions and remittance agencies to train their staff to detect victims of scams when they process remittance requests. Police also engage online advertising portals to proactively identify and remove fraudulent advertisers from these online platforms.In addition, SPF has forged close partnerships with international and local partners to tackle cybercrime. These partners include the INTERPOL Global Complex for Innovation (IGCI), Infocomm Development Authority (IDA), the Cyber Security Agency (CSA), local research institutes and institutes of higher learning. Such partnerships strengthen SPF’s cyber-forensic and detection capabilities in areas such as malware analysis and uncovering trends in online scams."
appropriate disposal of renovation debris and bulky items at hdb estates,Mr Zaqy Mohamad asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether the Ministry will strengthen measures to ensure that contractors with renovation permits from HDB adhere to regulations on the appropriate disposal of renovation debris and bulky items; (b) what enforcement measures and resources are deployed in new BTO estates to ensure compliance with such regulations; and (c) what measures will be taken against contractors who are caught illegally dumping such debris.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Town Councils (TCs) have the statutory responsibilities to manage and maintain the common properties in HDB estates, which include the regulation of proper disposal of renovation debris and bulky items. TCs may impose penalties if any parties are found to have contravened the respective TC’s by-laws.HDB requires renovation contractors to register with HDB before they are allowed to carry out the works. The terms of the registration include the proper disposal of debris. At newly completed BTO projects, HDB carries out site inspections to ensure the proper disposal of debris by renovation contractors. HDB will also inform the residents engaging these errant renovation contractors, to remind their contractors to stop any indiscriminate dumping. Notices will also be placed at the lift lobbies to remind other residents. Members of the public who come across improper disposal by a renovation contractor should report the matter to the respective HDB Branch. Contractors who are found to have improperly disposed of renovation debris and damaged the common properties can be fined up to $3,000 or debarred for a period of up to three years.Beyond enforcement, we also encourage TCs to consider providing haulage and debris removal services, or skip tanks for proper disposal, especially during the first few months of newly completed BTO precincts. Such measures have been found to be effective and have reduced the costs for cleaning up and repair of damages to property."
average teacher-student ratios over the decades,"Mr Seah Kian Peng asked the Acting Minister for Education (Schools) what has been the average teacher-student ratios for primary, secondary and junior college levels respectively over the decades of 1970-79, 1980-89, 1990-99, 2000-10 and 2011 to date.","Mr Ng Chee Meng: Since the 1970s, the student-teacher ratio – or what is known internationally as the Pupil-Teacher Ratio (PTR) has improved across all levels. For the Primary level, the average PTRs of each decade in Government and Government-aided schools improved progressively from 30 in the 1970’s, to 28, 26 and 23 in the subsequent decades, and to 16 in 2015. A similar trend also took place at the Secondary level, with the average PTR improving over each decade, from 25, 22, 21, 19 to 13 in 2015. Data for JCs was not available in the 1970s, when the JC landscape was in its nascent stage. From the 1980s till now, the average JC PTRs over each decade have improved from 25, 15, 12, to 10 in 2015.Our PTRs are comparable to the OECD average of 15 and 13 for primary and secondary schools respectively.The PTR is an aggregate measure that compares the total number of teachers to the total number of students, and reflects our increase in investment of teacher resources over the years to bring out the best in each child. Besides the general increase in resources for every student, we have also invested resources in developing customised programmes for those requiring special attention. This includes lower primary students, students weak in literacy and numeracy, as well as students with special education needs. Through our continuous efforts, we have achieved progressively good outcomes for our school-going cohorts over the years. One indicator of this would be the extremely low dropout rates of students who did not complete Secondary education, at less than 1% of the Primary One cohort."
maintenance of black and white bungalows,Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for Law (a) how many black and white bungalows are there in Sembawang managed by SLA; (b) how many are currently rented out; (c) what is the Ministry doing to maintain these bungalows some of which are in a state of disrepair; and (d) whether these bungalows will be preserved as part of our heritage.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The Singapore Land Authority (SLA) currently manages 45 black and white bungalows in Sembawang. 29 of them are currently rented out, while 4 units are available for rent as residences. The remaining 12 units are safeguarded for Government agencies which are exploring other uses for these properties.SLA has appointed a managing agent to carry out regular maintenance on all the vacant properties. The maintenance works include housekeeping, grass cutting, tree pruning and vector control. SLA’s managing agent also carries out painting, building, mechanical, electrical and interior works before the properties are let out, or during tenancy renewals. Repair works are also carried out when necessary. SLA ensures that none of these properties fall into a state of disrepair.The Government recognises the heritage value of these bungalows. The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) will take this into consideration when studying the future development plans for the area."
claims against foreign vehicle owners involved in accidents in singapore,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the process for Singaporeans to claim against foreign vehicle owners who are involved in accidents here, including damage to vehicles; (b) on the average, how long does it take to settle such claims; and (c) how can the Ministry assist in simplifying the process to facilitate easier motor insurance claims for both Singaporean and Malaysian motorists involved in accidents in Singapore.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Motorists of foreign-registered vehicles found responsible for causing accidents are liable for the damages incurred. Thus, Singaporeans involved can claim against the motorists or their insurer if the insurance covers third party property damage for accidents that occur in Singapore.In addition, the Motor Vehicle Act requires all vehicles used on Singapore roads, whether local or foreign-registered, to be insured against third party bodily injury and death. To effect this for Malaysian-registered vehicles, the Motor Insurers’ Bureau of Singapore (MIBS) has Special Agreements with Malaysian insurers to require that they settle claims against their insured who get into accidents in Singapore which involve deaths or injuries. In such cases, the MIBS will facilitate the third-party claimants from Singapore to file their claims with the insurers in Malaysia. The duration of the claim process varies from case to case, depending on the complexity."
licensing fee for street hawkers selling tissue paper packs,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether the Ministry will consider reducing the licensing fee for street hawkers selling tissues to a nominal fee as these hawkers are usually in dire financial situations.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Under the current Street Hawking Scheme, licensed street hawkers are allowed to sell goods, which they have to state upfront at the point of application, at fixed locations in public spaces without the need to pay rent. They only pay an annual licence fee of $120 or $10 per month and this has remained unchanged since the start of the scheme 15 years ago. There are no plans to revise this.Street hawking is not a permanent solution for someone trying to make a living. Those experiencing financial hardship can be assisted through the various help schemes available. There are also various Government-funded training programmes for those who wish to pick up new skills and seek more stable forms of employment."
comparative frequency and severity of oil spills on singapore roads,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Transport (a) how do the frequency and severity of oil spills on our roads compare with other major cities; and (b) what are the estimated economic losses due to the damage and travel delays caused.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Other major cities do not publish data of oil spills on roads, and hence we are unable to compare.Minor oil spills are quite common on our roads and there are at least three or four per day. However, major oil spills that require road repairs are infrequent. There were two in 2014 and seven last year. Of these, only three caused major tailbacks. Depending on assumptions on the economic value of time, we estimate the costs to be in the region of $200,000 to $300,000 for each of these tailback incidents.We are looking to impose a stronger deterrent against major oil spills."
societies denied registration by registrar of societies,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Home Affairs how many societies have been denied registration by the Registrar of Societies in 2005-2015 and what is the breakdown of cases by different types of reasons for rejection.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The Registrar of Societies refused 20 society applications from 2005 to 2015. The applications were refused on grounds provided within the legislation, under the Societies Act. They have been refused where the society was likely to be used for purposes that were unlawful or prejudicial to public peace, welfare or good order in Singapore; the applications did not comply with provisions under the Societies Act or its regulations; or where registration of the society would be contrary to the national interest."
enhancing care-giving options for dementia patients,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Health how can the Government (i) make professional caregiving for dementia patients more attractive so as to improve the pipeline of professional caregivers; and (ii) provide better training for foreign domestic helpers as many FDWs are neither trained nor mentally prepared to become caregivers for dementia patients.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Today, seniors with dementia may be cared for at home, or at aged care facilities such as day centres or nursing homes. Nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and healthcare assistants work together to care for these patients. MOH and the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) are working to improve the attractiveness of a career in professional caregiving for dementia patients in a few ways.First, through more structured training and capability development. We promote and fund training for care staff. Between 2013 and 2015, AIC offered over 2,400 training places in dementia-related courses and talks to equip care staff with the necessary skills to provide better care for seniors with dementia. In addition, our public hospitals arrange for other dementia care training for their care staff and those from other aged care partners like nursing homes and eldercare centres on skills such as managing challenging behaviours and communicating with dementia persons. MOH and AIC are now also working on a comprehensive competency framework to better define the skills and competencies required in dementia care. Besides enhancing skills and career development for the staff, it will help guide us in levelling up the skills content and productivity of the jobs.Second, through better remuneration and recognition. MOH has provided funding to our subvented aged care institutions to raise the pay of the care staff in these settings to be more competitive. The remuneration levels will be adjusted further in future, in tandem with progress in our work to raise skills and productivity.Finally, through promoting awareness among locals of careers in community care services, including dementia care. In January 2016 for example, MOH launched a campaign on job opportunities in the community care sector, and a Community Care Traineeship Programme to train and place locals to take on these jobs.Some seniors with dementia are cared for at home by caregivers and foreign domestic workers (FDWs). Under our Caregivers’ Training Grant, subsidies are provided for caregivers, including FDWs, to attend caregiving courses. There are currently 28 dementia care courses addressing a range of needs such as managing mealtimes and creating a comfortable and safe environment for persons with dementia. Between 2013 and 2015, about 1,000 out of more than 11,000 FDWs who had utilised the subsidy had attended courses on dementia care. Our public hospitals also provide training and guidance to family caregivers caring for dementia patients where needed before the patients are discharged home."
school re-admission assessments for children of returning overseas singaporeans,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling asked the Acting Minister for Education (Schools) whether school-going children of returning Singaporeans from overseas can be allowed to take the school re-admission assessments at the local consulates or embassies where they are presently residing instead of having to travel back to Singapore for the assessments.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: MOE is committed to helping returning Singaporeans re-enter our schools smoothly. We have made available several admissions routes, to cater to different circumstances and preferences.The first option is via the centralised School Placement Exercise for Returning Singaporeans (SPERS), which caters for admission into Secondary schools and Junior Colleges. The SPERS offers families the convenience of a single round of tests. Based on their performance, returning Singaporeans could indicate their school preferences and would be offered places in schools based on their results, choices, and school vacancies. The SPERS is conducted twice a year to cater to the different timing of return for overseas Singaporeans.Nevertheless, MOE recognises that not all returning Singaporeans are able to time their return to one of the SPERS cycles. A second option is for such returning Singaporean to approach MOE for help to obtain a school place. MOE will do our best to match the child to a school with vacancy that is near his or her home. The school will usually require the child to take a placement test and based on the results decide if it could offer the child a place and at which educational level.A third option is also available to families who already have a specific school in mind and want to approach that school directly to be considered for admission. Again, the school will require the child to take a placement test and can offer the returning Singaporean child a place if it has available vacancy.Most returning Singaporeans will make use of the centralised SPERS option as it is most convenient for them, where they only need to take a single set of tests and be assured of a posting by MOE to a suitable school.On the Member’s query, MOE has previously explored conducting admissions tests overseas, but the demand was low. Thus, we decided to conduct SPERS twice a year for the convenience of more returning Singaporeans, and to ensure that the tests are administered by trained invigilators so that placement outcomes are fair and educationally sound.In summary, there are sufficient routes of admissions to cater to returning Singaporeans seeking re-admissions at any time of the year. I would like to assure the Member that MOE’s commitment is for every returning Singaporean family to re-integrate smoothly back into Singapore society."
new public transport policy of mrt operations,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Transport what will be the new model and public transport policy of MRT operations after the acquisition of SMRT's operating rail assets by LTA on 1 October 2016.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Under the previous financing framework, rail operators own the operating assets, such as the trains and the signalling system. They are hence responsible for the building up, replacing and upgrading of the operating assets. However, as operators bear the full financial risk, they may be too cautious to undertake these costly works. This can affect the capacity and reliability of train services.That is why the Government implemented the New Rail Financing Framework, or the NRFF, in 2011 for the Downtown Line. Under the NRFF, the Government owns the operating assets and is responsible for expanding, replacing and upgrading them. The train operator pays an annual Licence Charge for the right to use these assets and to earn revenue from operating the line. The Licence Charge is paid into a Railway Sinking Fund to finance future build-up, replacement and upgrade of the operating assets.Following Downtown Line, LTA began discussions with SMRT and SBST to transit the older lines to the NRFF. The discussions with SMRT have concluded. Subject to SMRT shareholders’ approval, the North-South and East-West Lines, the Circle Line, and the Bukit Panjang LRT, will be transited to the NRFF.The transition will benefit commuters in the following ways. First, we will be able to respond to increased ridership, and replace and upgrade operating assets, in a more timely fashion. Second, the operator, having been relieved of heavy capital expenditure, can focus on providing reliable and well-maintained rail services for commuters. Third, we can shorten the licence tenure from 30 plus years to 15 years. The operator will need to perform well if they want to be reconsidered at the end of 15 years.On top of this, to ensure that the Government’s assets are well maintained and operations are better run, SMRT Trains will be required to comply with a rigorous set of Maintenance Performance Standards, Asset Management Requirements and Codes of Practice. In particular, the Maintenance Performance Standards will regulate maintenance processes upstream to ensure that issues which may affect train reliability are pre-emptively identified."
leasing of homes for short-term stays,"Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for National Development (a) in the last two years, how many home owners have been found to be illegally leasing out their premises to tenants for short-term stays; (b) what actions have been taken against these home owners; and (c) whether an update on URA's review of the short-term rental policy for private residential properties can be provided.","Mr Lawrence Wong: The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) took enforcement action against 36 cases of unauthorised short-term subletting in private residential premises in 2014, 23 cases in 2015, and 44 cases in the first six months of 2016. Altogether, there were 103 such cases between 2014 and mid-2016.Once URA confirms a case of unauthorised short-term subletting, it sends an enforcement notice to the offender requiring the unauthorised use to cease. In the vast majority of cases, offenders have complied with URA’s notices and there has been no need to undertake further action against them.URA’s public consultation on short-term rentals concluded in April 2015. The review is still ongoing. The issue of allowing short-term rentals warrants careful and balanced review without a rush to conclusion. In particular, we must carefully consider the implications of doing so, given the potential impact and disamenity of such rentals on neighbouring residents.In the meantime, URA’s existing requirement for a minimum tenancy duration of six-month in private residential rentals continues to apply."
height and weight allowance for local mixed breed dogs kept in hdb flats,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry will consider increasing the height and weight allowance for local mixed breed dogs approved for living in HDB flats under the Project ADORE scheme as the majority of dogs in our shelters and from the streets do not currently qualify for adoption under the scheme.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Under Project ADORE, mixed breed dogs that are up to 50 cm tall at the shoulder and weighing up to 15 kg may be rehomed in HDB flats. These limits are set at sizes roughly equivalent to the current approved dog breeds for HDB flats. Dogs of this size are generally considered to be more easily carried and controlled, especially in confined spaces such as lifts.I appreciate the Member’s intention to rehome more local mixed breed dogs. MND also supports this objective. But in making any changes to Project ADORE, we have to also take into consideration the concerns raised by HDB residents who have reservations about their neighbours keeping larger dogs in HDB flats. This is why we are taking steps to bring in more partners on the Project, and to broaden our engagement with residents. Ultimately, we want this Project to succeed. For that to happen, we should not rush the implementation, but must ensure that any changes to the criteria are broadly accepted by residents living in our HDB estates."
career progression of dental surgery assistants,Ms K Thanaletchimi asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the career progression of dental surgery assistants can be enhanced and their skills upgraded as part of a strategic manpower plan; (b) whether their jobs can be professionalised through deep skilling; and (c) whether the registration or licensing of dental surgery assistants can be considered.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The National Dental Centre and Singapore Dental Association jointly run a National Institute of Technical Education Certificate (NITEC) in Dental Assisting Programme. The programme trains between 25 to 30 Dental Surgery Assistants (DSA) annually.After they start their job, DSAs have further opportunities to upgrade their skills professionally. For example, besides undergoing training that enable them to better prepare dental surgeries and assist dental surgeons during procedures, they may also undertake courses in infection control, managing patients with mobility impairments, and emergency management. DSAs who perform well may progress to become Senior DSAs who have larger responsibilities such as coordinating the operations at dental clinics and teaching and training new DSAs.As DSAs assist the dental surgeons but do not treat or manage patients directly, our assessment is that registration and licensing of DSAs is not necessary. Dental surgeons are ultimately responsible for the safety and standards of care to patients who undergo dental surgery."
traffic and pedestrian accidents related to mobile phone usage,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is the number of road accidents related to the use of mobile phones or other personal electronic devices by pedestrians in the last three years; (b) what efforts are made to educate pedestrians on the dangers of using such electronic devices while walking; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider banning the use of personal electronic devices by pedestrians while they are walking or using the roads.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The number of road accidents involving pedestrians has remained fairly stable over the past three years, with an average of 952 such accidents. We do not have the breakdown of the number of accidents that are related to the use of mobile phones or personal electronic devices.It is not practical to ban the use of electronic devices by pedestrians when they are walking or crossing the road. A better approach is to instil good road safety habits in road-users.In this regard, the Traffic Police conducts outreach programmes to raise road safety awareness. Such educational and engagement efforts include road safety training for the public, as well as talks and exhibitions at schools and community events.Last year, the Traffic Police introduced the ""Use Your RoadSense"" movement to inculcate good road behaviour and practices amongst all road users, including pedestrians. This includes the importance of pedestrians remaining alert to their surroundings and not be distracted when using the roads."
security clearance for those applying for jobs at government agencies,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) in what contexts do statutory boards, Ministries or other organisations send job applicants' personal data to the Internal Security Department (ISD) or any other designated department for security clearance; and (b) what safeguards are in place to ensure the accuracy of the information collected and used in the security clearance procedure.","Mr K Shanmugam: Security and background checks for Government jobs are not unique to Singapore - many countries do so. The checks are done in a variety of contexts by different agencies and departments. Several factors could be relevant, including the security classification of the position, the nature of work and the confidentiality of the information that the position deals with. It is difficult to be more precise because the question is so broad. And for operational reasons, I will not be able to go into how or when such checks are done.As regards the second part of the question on safeguards, the information collected for security checks is looked at, and assessed where possible against other relevant information for reliability and accuracy. Officers are guided by their supervisors as necessary on what to look out for when assessing the information. I am unable to say more without getting into confidential operational procedures."
extending enhancement for active seniors programme to seniors living in private estates,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry will consider extending the Enhancement for Active Seniors (EASE) programme to seniors living in private estates who have no one supporting them and who have little savings.,Mr Lawrence Wong: There are no immediate plans to extend EASE to private estates at this moment. But we will continue to study this.
recovering revenue from motorists who evade car park charges,Ms Sun Xueling asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the possibility of collecting back the revenue lost from motorists who evade parking charges; and (b) whether new solutions are being considered to counter manipulation of the carpark system by motorists.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The process to recover parking charges involves much time and manpower resources. Nevertheless, HDB will do its best in tracking down errant motorists who evade parking charges. HDB will also leverage suitable technology like CCTV to help in the process of recovering these parking charges. However, this will have to be balanced with the cost effectiveness of chasing down every errant motorist.Going forward, HDB will make greater use of technology to help prevent evasion of car park charges and recover any loss in parking charges. In addition, HDB will be implementing more mitigating measures to reduce future tailgating instances, such as installing additional humps to prevent motorists from following too closely behind another vehicle; putting up ""No Tailgating"" signboards to warn motorists; and possibly banning use of the car park by errant motorists if their outstanding charges are not paid up.Another key strategy is to take tighter enforcement actions against errant motorists. The Parking Places Rules have been amended in July 2016 to allow immediate enforcement action against motorists who deliberately evade payment of parking charges. Recalcitrant cases will face a stiffer fine amount, of up to $2,000. Such measures will raise public awareness of the seriousness of these offences, and help to deter evasion of parking charges in the first place."
impact of extending equal medical benefits to female pensioners who retired before 2005 and their dependants,Mr Leon Perera asked the Prime Minister (a) how many female pensioners are there currently who have retired before 2005; (b) whether the Ministry will consider extending equal medical benefits to this group of pensioners' dependants especially spouses; and (c) how much is the projected incremental pension expenditure should equal benefits be extended to the pensioners' dependants including spouses.,"Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): There are currently 8,400 female pensioners who retired before 2005.Since 2005, all officers, male and female, on the Medisave-cum-Subsidised Outpatient (or MSO) scheme can claim medical benefits for their spouse, and for their dependant unmarried children below the age of 18. Pensioners and serving officers on the older medical schemes can opt to convert to the MSO scheme at any time. However, as the older medical schemes offer more generous benefits than the MSO scheme, few have done so.If medical coverage were to be extended to the dependants of all female pensioners and serving officers currently enrolled in the older medical schemes, the additional cost would exceed $30 million annually.All Singaporeans, including the dependants and spouses of female pensioners on older civil service medical schemes, now benefit from lifelong protection provided by MediShield Life.In addition, those who are Pioneers also enjoy the benefits of the Pioneer Generation Package. This includes subsidies for healthcare and Medisave top-ups which will help with their healthcare costs. Medisave top-ups for dependants who are pioneers, and Medishield Life coverage continue even after the life-time of the pensioner, unlike civil service medical benefits."
plans for highspeed rail project to proceed without delay and losses,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Transport with the announcement of the US Department of Justice's investigations into 1MDB and the ongoing investigations by MAS, AGC and CAD of various 1MDB-related fund flows through Singapore for possible securities fraud, cheating and money laundering offences (a) whether the Government should be concerned about Bandar Malaysia as the terminus of the High Speed Rail (HSR), being a 1MDB project; and (b) what contingencies are in place to ensure that the project will proceed with no delay and losses.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan:: The Singapore and Malaysia Governments signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on 19 July 2016 for the High Speed Rail project. Under the MOU, each Government takes responsibility for funding, constructing and maintaining the civil infrastructure and stations within their own countries. Therefore, the Malaysian Government will be responsible for funding, constructing and maintaining the Bandar Malaysia terminus. We would not be involved.Furthermore, we have worked out with the Malaysians a robust commercial framework and approach for joint procurement that we believe will give the best opportunity for the High Speed Rail project to be financially viable and sustainable in the long term. A bilateral committee will also be formed to oversee the cross-border aspects of the project, including to ensure adherence to timelines and minimise delays."
impact of healthcare infrastructure expansion plans on staff's remuneration,"Ms K Thanaletchimi asked the Minister for Health with the infrastructure expansion plans of current and future healthcare institutions, how will the expansion be funded so that the remuneration of healthcare staff will not be affected when the healthcare clusters have to dig into their reserves to fund current excess capacities.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Ministry of Health (MOH) fully funds the development costs of healthcare infrastructure at our public healthcare institutions. This includes the cost of building in spare capacity to cater for future expansion to meet increases in demand.Spaces catering to future expansion are designed so that the institutions are able to put them to productive uses in the interim. This minimises the holding cost associated with such spare capacity. When institutions encounter difficulties doing so, MOH will work with them on possible solutions and assist them with separate funding to defray these additional costs if necessary.Therefore, the cost of expansion of our healthcare institutions is separately funded and should not affect the funding for the remuneration of our healthcare staff."
next batch of noise barriers for mrt tracks,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Transport (a) when will LTA be installing its next batch of noise barriers for MRT tracks; and (b) whether these barriers will be installed in the Nee Soon South constituency and, if so, where will these noise barriers be located and how long will it take to complete the installation.",Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The tender for the next phase of the noise barrier programme is planned for the second half of this year. It will include Nee Soon South constituency. We expect to start installing noise barriers along Yishun Ave 2 in 2019.
ministry's purchase of document generator system and efforts to integrate system with existing platforms,"Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for Manpower with regard to the Report of the Auditor-General for FY15/16 on the Ministry's purchase of a Document Generator System (DGS) (a) whether there is a provision made for the integration of a DGS in the original specifications for the $27.49 million Foreign Domestic Worker System (FDWS); (b) who advised the Ministry to procure the additional DGS at a cost of $432,407; and (c) who are the suppliers of the FDWS and DGS.","Mr Lim Swee Say: In 2012, MOM initiated a multi-year project to redevelop our IT systems for the processing of all work pass types comprising EPs, S Passes and Work Permits (covering FW and FDW).We called a tender in 2013 for phase 1 of the project covering the FDW system (FDWS). The scope included a common document generator system (DGS) to handle the high volume of correspondences (letters, notices, advisories etc) not just for FDWs but across all the work pass types. The phase 1 tender, excluding the DGS, was awarded to Thoughtworks in 2014. The DGS was separately awarded to NCS as NCS had proposed a software product that was more scalable and hence could be used by the entire work pass IT system for all the work pass types.However, as the project progressed, we discovered that more time was needed to fully integrate the common DGS with the FDWS. This would potentially delay the launch of FDWS and consequently incur additional cost as we would have to extend the use of the existing IT system. Hence, on balance, we decided to adopt a custom-built solution offered by Thoughtworks for the FDWS alone at no additional cost to us. The custom-built solution was suitable as the FDWS has a lower volume of correspondences. FDWS went live starting from December 2014 with the full launch in December 2015.Although the common DGS was not used for the FDWS, we will be using it in the subsequent phases of the IT redevelopment. It will be used to handle the higher volume of correspondences for the EPs, S Passes and other Work Permits as originally intended. Hence, the common DGS procured in phase 1 of the project will be put to good use in subsequent phases of the project which will start in 2017."
makeshift brothels in heartland areas like punggol and woodlands,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what steps are being taken by the police to deal with makeshift brothels being set up in secluded areas within heartland areas like Punggol and Woodlands; and (b) whether investigations have been undertaken to determine whether there have been any women or girls who are victims of human trafficking at such locations.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The Police conduct enforcement operations regularly to deter and detect such activities.Over the past year, the Police have conducted anti-vice operations, in several places, including around heartland parks in Woodlands and Punggol. Two sex workers were arrested at Woodlands Town Garden in October 2015 and 21 persons, comprising 13 men and 8 sex workers, were arrested at Punggol Waterway Park in November 2015.Besides enforcement, the Police also work with grassroots leaders and other Government agencies such as the Singapore Land Authority to deter persons from entering forested areas to conduct such activities. These measures include improving lighting conditions, installing closed-circuit television cameras and enhancing patrols and enforcement checks in the area.For the two-year period from January 2014 to December 2015, Police’s investigations involving the sex workers arrested at makeshift brothels did not reveal any evidence of TIP offences. These foreign sex workers are recruited by operators in their home countries and come to Singapore to engage in this work voluntarily.The Police have set up a dedicated team of specialist officers to investigate sex trafficking cases.Besides the Police, frontline officers and support staff from other relevant government agencies have been trained on the procedures and case management approach for TIP cases. Suspected TIP victims will be referred to shelters and given appropriate assistance."
reasons for increase in rates at hdb and ura car parks,Mr Alex Yam asked the Minister for National Development with the recently announced increase in parking charges for URA and HDB carparks (a) what has been the main increase in cost in maintaining and operating carparks that require the increase; (b) what is the number of vehicles that will be affected by the differentiated season parking charges for second cars; and (c) whether there will be any assistance provided for older vehicle owners who may face difficulties with the increased season parking or hourly charges.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: While car park charges have remained constant for the last 14 years, costs have increased over this same period. Since 2002, core-inflation has risen by about 30%. The total costs of building, operating and maintaining HDB residential car parks have increased even more, by a total of about 40%.The main increase in cost is due toa. Rising overheads in the construction industry;b. More capital expenditures in new and existing HDB carparks, such as lifts and roof-shelters at multi-storey carparks; andc. Additional repair works required to maintain an increasing number of ageing carparks.In reviewing the parking rates, we differentiated the HDB season parking charges such that residents pay a lower season parking rate for their first car. Season parking rates for subsequent cars, or non-residents who use HDB carparks, are set at a higher charge to reflect the full cost recovery rate. This applies to about 31,500 HDB households, or around 12% of the 261,400 HDB households who own cars. We currently do not have plans to further subsidise other groups of car owners."
co-ordination between lta and ica for toll collection at land checkpoints,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Transport (a) why is there a lack of inter-agency co-ordination between LTA and ICA in implementing toll collection at the Causeway checkpoints; (b) whether it is a standard procedure for LTA to monitor and review its projects to look for weaknesses; and (c) whether there is communication to LTA officers at all levels on the requirement of interfacing with other Government departments and agencies.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The Land Transport Authority (LTA) and Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) had coordinated on the current process which relies on LTA officers stationed in the secondary clearance area to enforce against tolls and fees evasion. This allows ICA officers to focus on immigration and security screening. Having reviewed this process together with ICA, we believe that it can be improved. The two agencies are now jointly studying the feasibility of lifting the drop-arm barriers at the ICA immigration counter only after tolls and fees have been paid. This is not a straightforward exercise, as there are concerns such as ICA officers potentially being distracted by this new responsibility and speed of immigration clearance, that have to be addressed.I assure the Member that LTA regularly reviews its processes to enhance the effectiveness of its operations, and in collaboration with other agencies where needed."
"supply, demand and pricing of water","Mr Seah Kian Peng asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources in light of the recent low water levels in our water catchments as well as extreme climatic events in the long term, what can be done to ensure a stable and long-term supply of water.","33 Mr Seah Kian Peng asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether the price of water now reflects the full cost of water services including the cost of transporting waste water and the building of all water infrastructure; and (b) if not, what is the extent of the Government subsidy and to what extent will prices have to rise in order to reflect full cost recovery and not just the long-run marginal cost of water.34 Mr Seah Kian Peng asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether the provision of average water consumption figures of households of the same housing type in the same block or street to allow consumers to compare and contrast their consumption patterns with their neighbours has been effective in spurring water conservation.35 Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources if he can provide an update on PUB's efforts in the past two years to support companies with high water utilisation rates in their initiatives to recycle or re-use water.36 Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether domestic households can pay a lower water conservation tax when their water bills show that they have used less water than the national average for their housing type for a consecutive period of six months.Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Both Mr Seah and Mr Yong have raised questions related to the supply, demand and pricing of water. Indeed, water remains an existential issue for Singapore.First, let me address Mr Seah’s concern over our future water supply. Long-term planning to meet water demand has always been at the top of my Ministry’s agenda. At the recent Committee of Supply Debate, I had shared that PUB, our national water agency, had completed its Water Master Plan 2016 review. This plan outlines Singapore’s long-term water supply strategy for the next 50 years. The plan not only seeks to ensure water adequacy to meet future demand, but also caters for resilience against contingencies, such as prolonged dry weather and other disruptions to water supply sources.Our total water demand is projected to double by 2060. While we seek to augment supply from local catchments, there is a limit to this, as two-thirds of Singapore is already water catchment. To ensure long term water security, we plan to double our NEWater and desalination capacities by 2030. By 2060, these two sources will supply up to 85% of our water needs, and also help to reduce our vulnerability to weather uncertainties.We are now developing our third and fourth desalination plants, which will be ready in 2017 and 2019 respectively. At the Singapore International Water Week last month, I announced that we would build a fifth desalination plant on Jurong Island, with the capacity to produce 30 million gallons of water per day.The fifth NEWater plant will commence operations in end 2016. We are also enhancing our used water system ahead of demand. PUB will be implementing Phase 2 of the Deep Tunnel Sewerage System (or DTSS in short) over the next 10 years. This superhighway, designed to last the next 100 years, will allow us to collect used water more efficiently. Our water reclamation plants and NEWater factories will be expanded progressively to treat and recycle every drop of used water collected. PUB aims to increase Singapore’s used water recycling rate from the current 30% to up to 55% in the long term, by capturing used water more effectively and improving treatment technology.Hence, I would like to assure members that the Ministry and PUB are actively planning for and implementing infrastructure to meet long term water needs and enhance our resilience.But simply enhancing supply is not sustainable. Mr Yong has rightly pointed out the importance of water conservation, in both the non-domestic and domestic sectors.A large share of our water demand growth will come from the non-domestic sector. Hence, PUB has put in place extensive measures to encourage companies to use water efficiently, including recycling.Since 2015, PUB has required the submission of Water Efficiency Management Plans (WEMP) for large water users that consume 60,000 cubic meters or more a year, equivalent to 24 Olympic-sized swimming pools. These plans help companies become more aware of their water usage patterns, and identify ways to reduce consumption. More than 600 large water users have submitted their plans. PUB will study the data collected, with the aim of developing water efficiency benchmarks and good practice guidelines, including that for water recycling, for different sectors.PUB also implements the Water Efficient Buildings certification programme which recognises building owners who put in effort to raise water efficiency. Further, PUB, together with SPRING Singapore and industry stakeholders, has developed guidelines, tools and best practices to help users improve water usage efficiency. Other enabling measures include a Water Efficiency Manager Course for Facilities and Operations managers, as well as system consultants and certification bodies in water management.Companies can also tap on a Water Efficiency Fund (WEF) for water efficiency studies and projects. Last year, there were 203 successful WEF applications with a total approved funding of $3.9 million. Projects supported include water recycling projects and installation of private water meters to help companies better detect leaks and monitor water usage.One specific example where PUB is working closely with large water users to implement recycling is with the Singapore Refining Company. PUB is working with SRC to implement an Effluent Treatment Recycling Plant to produce NEWater-grade water for non-potable uses. When completed by 2016, it will help the company reduce its NEWater use by 2,500 m3 (an Olympic-sized pool) per day. On a wider scale, PUB plans to work with companies on Jurong Island to meet their cooling demand with seawater instead of freshwater supply.For the domestic sector, PUB has mandated water efficiency labelling and minimum standards to help consumers select more water efficient fittings and appliances. PUB also carries out extensive outreach and educational programmes to encourage households to use water judiciously, as well as studies on households’ water usage patterns, to identify opportunities to improve water efficiency.For instance, PUB participated in an initiative led by SP Services to re-design the utility bill to help consumers understand their utility usage. From this month onwards, all domestic customers will be able to see how their utility consumption compares against the national average as well as the average consumption of households of similar housing types. We hope that this additional comparison feature, together with our other water conservation initiatives, will help consumers to be more mindful of how they use water in their daily lives. As it may take some time for water consumption behaviour to change, PUB will continue to monitor and assess the effect of the bill comparison feature.Finally, on water pricing. Water has to be priced appropriately to manage water demand, and to ensure sustainability in water supply. In Singapore, we price water based on the long run marginal cost (LRMC) of the next available drop of water. Mr Seah has asked if this price reflects its full cost.Currently, the total price of water reflects the LRMC, and comprises the water tariff, used water charges, as well as a Water Conservation Tax (WCT). The total water price recovers the costs of production and conveyance of potable water to meet demand, the treatment of used water, and the maintenance of the used water network. The development cost of infrastructure to collect used water (ie, sewers) is funded by government grants as sewers are regarded as a public good. The WCT is imposed as a percentage of the total water consumption to reinforce the message that water is precious from the very first drop. We believe that the total water price must reflect costs as closely as possible and have pegged it to the cost of producing the next drop of potable water, which is likely to be more from desalination and NEWater.Mr Yong has suggested tier-ing the WCT. Currently, a higher WCT is already levied on households that consume more water. While households that consume less than 40m3 of water pay a water tariff of $1.17/m3, and a WCT at 30% of the water tariff, households that consume more than 40m3 of water per month pay a higher tariff and a higher WCT, at 45% of tariff. This differentiated WCT rate, as well as the differentiated water tariff, serves to discourage excessive water consumption. Mr Yong’s suggestion is to further tier the WCT based on the average household consumption for each housing type. This would mean having to apply different thresholds for different housing types, and changing the thresholds whenever the national average consumption for a housing type changes. Such a complex structure could be confusing to consumers and is more challenging to implement, compared to the current WCT structure.But both Members’ questions have highlighted pertinent issues regarding the pricing of water - issues such as the sustainability of our water supply in future, as well as the need to manage demand. It has to be noted that the price of water has remained unchanged for 16 years, since 2000. PUB has been able to keep the price relatively stable all these years because of improvements in membrane technology and productivity. Most of the incremental improvements have already been reaped and what remains are longer term breakthrough technologies which may take many more years to be proven operationally and become deployable. At the same time, wages, asset renewal, and energy prices have risen over time and will continue to exert upward pressure on water costs. In addition, the challenges posed by climate change and increasing urbanisation have necessitated additional costly infrastructure to enhance our water supply resilience. In the last five years, PUB has completed or launched an unprecedented number of major projects - including two reservoirs, two NEWater factories, four desalination plants, and Phase Two of the Deep Tunnel Sewerage System with a centralised Water Reclamation Plant. Hence, while PUB will continue to explore new technology to lower costs of production, especially for desalination and recycling, these technology-induced cost efficiencies may not be able to ""outweigh"" the increase in other cost drivers like capital, maintenance and manpower expenses. We will need to continually review the price of water to ensure that our water system remains financially sustainable and reflects the scarcity value of water accurately. With the support of all stakeholders doing our part to use water wisely, we can look forward to SG100, confident that our taps will always flow."
factors determining increase in hdb and ura car park charges,Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for National Development what is the basis for deciding to increase the car park charges for HDB and URA car parks.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Our key principle is that car owners should bear the full cost of ownership and usage of cars. This includes the cost of parking cars. Hence parking charges in our HDB estates are sized to cover the cost of building, operating and maintaining residential car parks. It would not be equitable for the government to subsidise the cost of parking, as this would mean that non-car owners are subsidising car owners. Today, about 3 in 10 HDB households own cars, i.e. the majority of our residents do not own cars1.While car park charges have remained constant for the last 14 years, costs have increased over this same period. Since 2002, core-inflation has risen by about 30%. The total costs of building, operating and maintaining HDB residential car parks have increased even more, by a total of about 40%.The main increase in cost is due toa. Rising overheads in the construction industry;b. More capital expenditures in new and existing HDB carparks, such as lifts and roof-shelters at multi-storey carparks; andc. Additional repair works required to maintain an increasing number of ageing carparks.Therefore, while HDB has largely been able to achieve cost recovery for its residential car parks in the past, this will not be the case going forward. From 2002 to 2015, HDB managed an average annual surplus of 4% of its average income (or $19 million) in its car park activity. But the fiscal position is worsening sharply. Without the revisions to car park charges, HDB expects to incur a deficit of 13% of average income, or $80 million this year. From next year till at least 2020, a deficit of around $100 million is projected every year. In fact, HDB expects to continue running a small deficit in the coming years, even with this latest increase in fees.Most of URA’s carparks are in the city centre and the parking charges are set higher than HDB carparks in order to appropriately manage parking demand. Despite this, without the fee revision, URA also expects to incur a deficit in its carpark activity in the coming years. Hence from a cost recovery point of view, adjustments have to be made to both HDB and URA car park charges.In reviewing the parking rates, we have also differentiated the HDB season parking charges such that residents pay a lower season parking rate for their first car. Season parking rates for subsequent cars, or non-residents who use HDB carparks, are set at a higher charge to reflect the full cost recovery rate. While the revised parking charges will result in higher costs for car owners, it is necessary to do so to cover the costs of building, operating and maintaining car parks. It is only fair for car owners to cover these costs, because the alternative is for non-car owners to subsidise car owners. Right-pricing our parking rates is also in line with our aim to be a more ""car-lite"" society."
assistance for bereaved families on administering deceased's estate,"Dr Tan Wu Meng asked the Minister for Law (a) what processes are put in place to inform and assist bereaved families on the process of administering a deceased's estate; (b) how many legal aid applications have been granted deductions by the Director of Legal Aid over the past three years and of which, how many have been for bereaved families facing financial hardship; and (c) whether the Ministry has plans to review the disposable income and capital for legal aid means testing.","Mr K Shanmugam: When a person passes away, the next-of-kin will have to apply to the Family Justice Courts to obtain the necessary documents that authorise specific persons to undertake the administration of the deceased’s estate. The next-of-kin may check the Courts’ website for an information guide, or contact the Courts for any queries relating to the filing of Probate.If the estate value does not exceed $50,000, the next-of-kin can apply to the Public Trustee to administer the estate, subject to certain criteria for instance, that there are no conflicting claims to the estate and that the estate does not have any outstanding debts. For estates of higher value, the next-of-kin will have to engage a lawyer to assist in the estate administration, and the costs of doing so can be recovered from the estate. Persons of limited means may also approach the Legal Aid Bureau or legal clinics in the community for legal advice.The Legal Aid Bureau (LAB) receives around 10,000 applications per year, of which around 7% are probate, letters of administration and other estate cases (collectively referred to as ‘Estate Cases’). Between FY2013 and FY2015, LAB received a total of 1940 applications for Estate Cases. Of these, 1566 applications, or about 80% of applications, qualified for legal aid, but not all of them followed through.To qualify for legal aid in civil matters, under the Legal Aid and Advice Act, applicants will have to satisfy a means test. The means test is satisfied where the applicant’s disposable income is not more than $10,000 per year, and he or she has not more than $10,000 of disposable capital. Contributions to the Central Provident Fund, amounts for dependents’ living expenses and the applicant’s HDB flat are automatically deducted from the calculation of disposal income and disposable capital.In addition, further deductibles can be applied in certain special circumstances, such as where the applicant is suffering from sudden physical or mental disability which permanently and severely restricts the applicant’s capacity to earn an income. However, there is no special category for bereaved families, because legal aid is granted based on the applicant’s financial status.In 2013, the Act was amended to allow approximately 25% of Singapore citizens and permanent residents to qualify for legal aid under the means test, up from 17% previously. The Director of Legal Aid was also given discretion, in family proceedings which involve children or protection orders, to ensure that the most vulnerable persons in a family dispute are eligible for legal aid."
review of government's demand aggregation contracts,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Finance (a) how are demand aggregation contracts for outsourced manpower services called for by Vital (the agency for shared services within the public sector); (b) what are the measures in place to ensure that the terms included in such contracts are fair and reasonable and that workers are not short-changed; and (c) what measures are in place to ensure that procurement officers for such contracts are kept up-to-date on changes in employment laws to ensure that workers in outsourced contracts are bound by fair employment terms.,"Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam: From time to time, public sector agencies may require temporary staff to support ad-hoc projects or cover those on leave. To meet such temporary demands, one avenue is for agencies to procure manpower services from employment agencies. Vital, as the Government’s shared services provider, will consolidate the demands of Public Service agencies and establish a Public Service-wide contract so that agencies may procure from the contract efficiently, as and when they require such services. Like most other Government tenders, the demand aggregated contract for outsourced manpower services is called through open tender on the GeBIZ procurement portal.All the employment agencies in Vital’s service-wide contracts are required to comply with prevailing laws including the Employment Act, Central Provident Fund Act, Child Development Co-Savings Act, Skills Development Levy Act and Work Injury Compensation Act. Hence, workers under Vital’s service-wide contracts would enjoy the employment entitlements covered by these regulations, including leave, medical and overtime benefits and adequate termination notice.Vital works closely with the Ministry of Manpower to ensure that the employment agencies comply with the law. In addition, any feedback on non-compliance will be investigated. If substantiated, depending on the severity of the non-compliance, the contract with the employment agency may be terminated. Vital is also aware of and are looking into how the latest guidelines, recently released by the Ministry of Manpower, National Trade Union Congress (NTUC) and Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF) on 20 June 2016, can be adopted."
sectors covered under industry transformation programme,Mr Zaqy Mohamad asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (a) what are the identified sectors to be covered under the $4.5 billion Industry Transformation Programme; and (b) what are the sector-specific measures to help qualifying companies in the identified sectors.,"Mr S Iswaran: As part of the $4.5 billion Industry Transformation Programme (ITP), the Government will develop individual Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) for 23 sectors. They include both domestically-oriented sectors such as construction, healthcare, food services, and retail, as well as outward-oriented sectors such as hotels, logistics, food manufacturing, and precision engineering. These sectors account for about 80% of GDP.Each ITM will comprise a growth and competitiveness plan, and will integrate existing sector-specific initiatives and schemes. These include programmes to upgrade productivity, develop skills, promote technology adoption & innovation, and help companies expand overseas. Each ITM will be developed and implemented in partnership with companies, industry associations, business chambers, and unions.Let me use Precision Engineering (PE) as an example. The productivity roadmap for the sector promotes automation, process improvement, and job redesign among PE companies. At the same time, the Precision Engineering Vocational Continuing Education and Training (PEVC) programme will develop a pipeline of skilled craftsmen to support the shift to higher value-added manufacturing. In the longer term, we also aim to seize growth opportunities afforded by technologies such as additive manufacturing and advanced robotics. The Singapore Precision Engineering and Technology Association (SPETA) and the Singapore Manufacturing Federation (SMF) are partnering the Government in refining and implementing these initiatives.Collectively, the ITMs are important opportunities for the Government and industry to work together and maximise the benefit for companies. The plans will be refined over time in response to external developments and trends as well as the needs of companies in each sector."
regulator's decision for same-sex kiss scene in musical,Mr Kok Heng Leun asked the Minister for Communications and Information with regard to MDA's action after a complaint has been made about a same-sex kiss scene in the musical Les Miserables (a) why did MDA decide to take action; and (b) what was the process undertaken by MDA which led to their decision.,"Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim: When classifying arts entertainment, the Media Development Authority (MDA) is guided by the Arts Entertainment Classification Code (AECC), which is drafted in consultation with the Arts Consultative Panel and the industry to reflect current social norms and standards. In applying the Code, MDA takes into consideration the theme, the context in which the scenes appear and the treatment of the content, based on the information provided by the applicants.In the case of Les Miserables, the MDA gave the musical a ‘General’ rating based on the script that was originally submitted. The same-sex kiss scene was not mentioned in that submission.Subsequently, MDA received public feedback that the musical contained a same-sex kiss scene. Upon reviewing the performance, MDA told the applicant that the rating for the musical would need to be revised to 'Advisory' due to the scene. The ‘Advisory’ rating helps to inform the public that there is content that may be offensive, or inappropriate for children. However, the applicant decided to remove the scene so as to keep the ‘General’ rating for the rest of the musical’s run."
qualifying for maternity protection under child development co-savings act and employment act,Ms Tin Pei Ling asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether the only document that is recognised for a female employee to qualify for maternity protection under the Child Development Co-savings Act and Employment Act is a medical report certifying her pregnancy; and (b) whether a female employee who qualified for maternity protection may appeal against unfair dismissal if she was dismissed after making known her pregnancy but suffered a miscarriage thereafter.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: The Employment Act (EA) and the Child Development Co-savings Act (CDCA) protect female employees during pregnancy and while on maternity leave.Employees who are eligible for maternity protection and benefits under the EA and CDCA must be certified pregnant by a registered medical practitioner. This certification can take the form of a memo, letter or medical report that is signed by the medical practitioner.The maternity protection against unfair dismissal applies throughout the pregnancy, regardless of whether the employee later has a miscarriage. An employee can submit an appeal to MOM if she was unfairly dismissed while pregnant. MOM will investigate accordingly and take appropriate actions under the EA."
government oversight of contracts for healthcare workers recruited for public healthcare institutions through private agencies,Ms K Thanaletchimi asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry monitors and exercises oversight of public healthcare institutions that procure manpower from recruitment agencies with these agencies being the employer of the workers as there are cases where these workers are placed under the agencies' contract terms with perpetual renewal of their contracts without permanent tenure.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Public healthcare institutions procure manpower from recruitment agencies primarily to meet short-term and temporary manpower needs. In doing so, the public healthcare institutions would typically specify to the recruitment agencies that all mandatory statutory contributions have to be made to the workers. However, other terms and conditions of the employment contract, including the tenure and renewal of the contracts, are negotiated between the recruitment agency and its employees, and are not under the purview of the public healthcare institutions and the Ministry."
election reporting by mainstream media on cooling-off day,Mr Chen Show Mao asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) what are the limitations and requirements applicable to reporting on election matters by the mainstream media on Cooling-Off Day; and (b) what are the differences in requirements applicable to the mainstream media and licensed online news sites in respect of reporting on election matters on Cooling-Off Day and what is the rationale for the same.,"Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim: The law is clear with respect to the reporting of election matters by both mainstream media and licensed online news sites on Cooling-Off Day and Polling Day. Both mainstream media and licensed online news sites can only report election-related news factually. The mainstream media and licensed online news sites cannot publish any election advertising - that is, material intended to raise the standing of, or secure the electoral success of, any candidate or party - on Cooling-Off Day and Polling Day."
better detection and management of child abuse cases,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Social and Family Development what safeguards are currently in place to provide for better detection and management of child abuse cases and what more can be done to prevent the number of such cases from escalating.,"50 Ms Sun Xueling asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what are the mechanisms put in place for early intervention of possible child abuse where young children under the age of five are placed in the care of parents who have a history of drug abuse or mental illness; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider an inter-Ministry monitoring effort for children who are at risk of child abuse to prevent such abuse before it happens.Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: Every child deserves to grow up in a safe environment free from abuse and neglect. Apart from taking upstream measures to strengthen families, my Ministry’s Child Protective Service has invested in strengthening the capabilities of our partners to detect abuse and intervene appropriately. For instance, we have over the years introduced better screening tools and training for professionals such as teachers, social workers, and healthcare workers to pick up early warning signs and either connect the families with community-based help, or escalate the case to the Ministry for intervention.In our intervention in a case of child abuse or neglect, we strike a balance between keeping the family together, and ensuring the immediate safety of the child. Where feasible and the safety of the child is not compromised, we prefer to keep the family together. For such cases, we would work with the relevant professionals and the child’s family to put in place a safety and case plan. Such a plan could include having a suitable family member as the main caregiver to watch over the child, or the family taking steps to ensure the alleged perpetrator does not spend time alone with the child. If the child’s caregiver has mental health or substance abuse issues, we would refer the caregiver for treatment. The aim is to minimise the risk of future harm to the child. In serious instances, we would have to make the difficult decision of removing a child from his home and placing him in alternative arrangements such as kinship or foster care.The monitoring and combating of abuse is done at the policy and planning level through the Inter-Ministry Workgroup on Child Protection. Operationally, the National Family Violence Networking System enables close collaboration and management of abuse among my Ministry, the Singapore Police Force, the Singapore Prison Service, the Courts, hospitals and Family Service Centres. My Ministry also monitors high-risk cases such as siblings of abused children, and partners with professionals to put in place a safety and case plan for soon-to-be delivered babies in families with a history of abuse. We will continue to work with the community to strengthen the preventive and monitoring efforts for at-risk children.There were instances where child abuse went undetected and unreported. To address this, we have invested in public education and outreach efforts to encourage members of the public to report to the ComCare Call helpline at 1800-222-0000 if they are aware of child abuse or if a child is at risk of being abused."
recourse for employers of foreign domestic workers with mental or critical illnesses,"Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what recourse does an employer of a foreign domestic worker (FDW) have when the hired FDW already has a mental illness, cancer or critical illness which may not be discoverable at the time of hiring and these are excluded from the compulsory insurance cover; and (b) whether it can be mandated that these illnesses be areas of coverage in the compulsory insurance which FDW agencies and/or employers of FDWs need to procure.","Mr Lim Swee Say: Every foreign domestic worker (FDW) is required to be certified fit for employment by a Singapore-registered doctor before she can start work. This involves a medical examination by the doctor and a declaration by the FDW on her medical history, covering pre-existing conditions such as mental illness, diabetes and heart disease. Any FDW who makes a false declaration will have her work pass revoked, may be charged in court, and permanently barred from working in Singapore.To ensure that the medical costs incurred by individual FDW are not transferred to other taxpayers, employers of FDWs are required to bear the cost of any medical treatment incurred by their FDWs. This includes illnesses not discovered earlier. Nonetheless, it is important to note that the current compulsory medical insurance coverage already covers fully 97% of all inpatient and day surgery bills for FDWs at public hospitals. For the small minority of employers who face genuine difficulties in paying their FDWs’ medical bills, they can seek assistance from Medical Social Workers at the relevant healthcare institutions.To keep premiums affordable and provide adequate coverage, insurance companies which sell the compulsory medical insurance for FDWs currently do not cover pre-existing illnesses. Mandating compulsory coverage of pre-existing illnesses will raise costs for all employers, even for those who do not need it, and therefore, needs to be carefully considered. Regardless, individual employers can voluntarily purchase additional insurance for greater coverage. Additionally, employers can choose to send their FDWs for more medical examinations prior to employment to check for pre-existing illnesses."
number and profile of children who do not attend pre-school,"Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) in the last three years, what has been the number and percentage of each cohort of Singaporean children who have not attended pre-school; (b) what is the typical profile of these children; (c) what are the main reasons preventing them from receiving pre-school education; and (d) whether the Ministry will consider making pre-school education compulsory.","Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: Over the last three years, over 90% of Singaporean children aged five to six years were enrolled in pre-schools. By age six, close to 99% of Singaporean children would have some pre-school experience.The Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) works with the community to reach out to Singaporean children who are not attending pre-school by age five. Our community outreach partners conduct home visits to understand the family’s situation and work closely with the family to overcome the barriers to the child’s pre-school participation.There are various profiles of children not attending pre-school, due either to their family’s circumstances or preferences. For example, there are those who are living overseas, or whose parents prefer other options for their child’s development such as home-schooling, enrichment classes or specialised interventions. There are also children from more disadvantaged backgrounds.We recognise the importance of the pre-school years in a child’s development, particularly for children from disadvantaged backgrounds. However, it is also important to preserve some parental choice and involvement in the type of experience a child has at pre-school. Hence, rather than a broad policy of compulsory education at the pre-school years, our approach is to ensure the provision of accessible, affordable and good quality pre-school services, with proactive outreach and targeted assistance for those from more disadvantaged backgrounds.In line with this approach, ECDA has started to progressively roll out KidSTART, a new initiative to reach out to and ensure that children from low income and vulnerable families have early access to appropriate health, learning and developmental support, including attending quality pre-school."
efforts to tackle phone scams,"Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) how many people have been arrested for phone scams in the past two years; (b) how many cases are currently under investigation; (c) how many scams are run by mainland Chinese targeting especially elderly citizens; (d) whether the Ministry will look into how it can more speedily alert the public, in particular the elderly, to any new phone scams; and (e) whether the Ministry will consider enhancing penalties against phone scammers.","Mr K Shanmugam: Scams are now being committed not just through phone conversations, but also over the Internet, as accessed through mobile phones and computers. Such scams include credit-for-sex scams, internet love scams, kidnap hoax scams and lottery scams. There were 2,450 of such cases in 2015 as compared to 1,007 cases in 2014. In the last two years, 127 persons were arrested in connection with these cases.Scammers convicted of cheating are liable to imprisonment terms of up to 10 years and a fine. MHA will continue to ensure that our laws are relevant and effective against scammers.Perpetrators of scams come from many different countries, including China. They do not select specific targets; they do a general sweep and hope that they strike at least a few victims. We have not observed any specific targeting of elderly victims.The Police recognise that public education is key in preventing members of the public from falling prey to scams. The Police regularly publicise crime advisories via different media platforms, such as Crimewatch episodes, newspapers, the Police’s Facebook page and the National Crime Prevention Council’s Scam Alert website.The Police have also strengthened efforts to reach out to the public, particularly the elderly, through Community Safety and Security Programmes and educational roadshows. In 2015, the Police conducted more than 80 roadshows in the community.We urge the public to exercise caution and vigilance, to avoid falling victim to scams."
recruitment of singaporeans in police force,Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) how is the recruitment drive to attract more Singaporeans to the Police Force progressing; (b) how many have joined in the last two years; (c) what is the retention rate; and (d) whether there are plans to expand the number of Neighbourhood Police Posts.,"Mr K Shanmugam: In the last two years, the Singapore Police Force recruited close to 1,300 Police Officers. The retention rate has been stable, with an annual resignation rate of 2%.There are however limits to how far we can sustain this pace of recruitment. Like the rest of the civil service, the SPF headcount is subject to a manpower management framework. The rate of recruitment will slow down over the next few years, in line with the slower growth in the overall local workforce.Given the many new demands on the SPF, whether it is to deal with the terrorist threat, cybercrime or transnational organised crime - it is important that we continue to recruit the best officers that we can within the manpower cap. It is also important that we make the best use of the Police Officers that we have by developing new concepts of operations, make smarter use of technology and invest in the training and development of our officers.We are currently in the midst of re-designing our Neighbourhood Police Posts (NPPs) as part of the new Community Policing System. We are studying how we can better use technology at the NPPs to provide round-the-clock automated services for residents, while allowing us to redeploy Police Officers away from the NPPs to more critical areas, such as patrols in the neighbourhoods. We will explore how to better position the NPPs as key nodes and rallying points for our community volunteer programmes such as SG Secure. There are currently no plans to increase the total number of NPPs but there may be relocation of some NPPs as the population shifts to new housing estates."
ensuring commuter safety during power outages and train breakdowns,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Transport what are the safety measures in place during MRT breakdowns to ensure that (i) commuters will not be trapped in darkness during a power failure occurring either in the tunnels or elsewhere on the track during night-time; and (ii) commuters will not be endangered when required to walk along LRT/MRT tracks during breakdowns.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Every MRT and LRT station is equipped with an independent backup power supply that provides basic lighting in the tunnels and stations during a power failure. This backup power supply also keeps critical systems such as signalling, communications and platform screen doors functioning. All our trains are equipped with backup batteries to power emergency lighting, ventilation fans and the public address system.If passengers need to be de-trained, the operators have to follow strict safety procedures. They must ensure that traction power is switched off for the affected stretch, so that no trains will move into and within the sector. Trains will also be held at adjoining stations as an immediate measure to further isolate that stretch. The operators will then deploy their staff to the stalled train to guide and assist passengers back to the station via the walkway. The train operators, together with LTA and SCDF, conduct regular exercises to ensure that the staff are adequately trained and prepared to handle such contingencies safely and effectively."
impact of compulsory education act on enrolment for primary school,"Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Acting Minister for Education (Schools) since the Compulsory Education Act came into force in 2003 (a) whether there has been 100% enrolment for primary school and, if not, what are the challenges; and (b) how many parents are charged each year for failing to send their children to attend primary school.","Mr Ng Chee Meng: The Compulsory Education (CE) Act requires all Singaporean children above the age of six and below the age of 15 who are residing in Singapore to regularly attend a national primary school, unless they are exempted from doing so. We hold parents accountable for this, as well as their children’s participation in the Primary One (P1) registration exercise in the year the children turn six.Most parents dutifully register their children in our national primary schools unless they are exempted for valid reasons. For instance, some children have special educational needs or are enrolled in designated schools. A small number of parents also obtain approval to home-school their children.To date, we have not found it necessary to resort to prosecution. No parents have been charged under the Compulsory Education Act since its inception."
impact on rice supply given el nino effect and weather changes,"Mr Chen Show Mao asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Trade) (a) whether the Ministry foresees a reduction in the supply of rice from countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, India and elsewhere in Southeast and South Asia due to the 2015-2016 El Niأ±o and associated drought and heatwave; and (b) how might such a reduction impact rice prices in Singapore over the rest of the year.","Mr Lim Hng Kiang: As a consequence of El Nino, the US Department of Agriculture expects a reduction in world rice production for 2016 by 1.6% or 7.7 million metric tons due to reduced crop yields in major rice-producing countries such as Thailand, India and Vietnam. However, the market does not expect a supply disruption due to the availability of rice from stockpiles, such as those in Thailand.Furthermore, El Niño has weakened with the arrival of the monsoon in June. World rice production for the year ahead is forecast by the US Department of Agriculture to increase by 9.8 million metric tons.Retail prices of rice in Singapore have been relatively stable in the last one year and are expected to remain so for the rest of the year, barring any unforeseen crisis."
communication of information about safety and emergency features to commuters,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan asked the Minister for Transport whether public transport operators are required to ensure that information about safety and emergency features of public facilities are effectively communicated to public transport users.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Under the rail and bus licences, LTA requires the operators to ensure that commuters are adequately informed about transport safety and emergency facilities and procedures. Information is currently disseminated through the use of prominent signs, as well as regular announcements and videos at train stations, bus interchanges and on board trains and buses. We are reviewing the Bukit Panjang LRT incident to see if more needs to be done in this regard."
increasing singapore's organ transplant rate,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Health (a) whether Singapore's organ transplant rate has increased since the launch of the ""Live On"" campaign in 2008; (b) how does the rate compare with those of other countries with similar quality of life; (c) whether there is adequate training of and buy-in from doctors in intensive care and emergency units to improve the organ retrieval rate; and (d) whether a review of the opt-out system and consideration of the mandated consent system is now timely.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Ministry of Health adopts a multi-pronged approach to promote and facilitate organ transplants. The Medical (Therapy, Education and Research) (MTERA) was enacted in 1972 to facilitate donation of deceased organs and tissues for the purposes of transplantation, education or research. The Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA) was introduced in 1987 to facilitate deceased organ donation through an opt-out scheme. HOTA was subsequently expanded in 2004 to include heart, liver, corneas, as transplantable organs (instead of only kidneys) and institute a framework to regulate living donor organ transplants.Dedicated public awareness efforts were also made to educate the public of the life-saving benefits of organ donation. In 2008, MOH launched a three year ""Live On"" campaign aimed at raising societal consciousness and acceptance of organ donation as an acceptable and generous act of goodness.These efforts have helped to bring about close to 2,000 transplants from deceased organ donations between 2004 and 2015. These included 442 kidney, 157 liver, 42 heart and 1,333 cornea transplants. Over the same period, there were 478 living donor organ transplants. These included 379 kidney and 99 liver living donor organ transplants. Specifically from 2008 after the launch of the ""Live On"" campaign, we observed an increase in the number of organ transplant conducted, from an average of 174 cases per year between 2004 and 2007 to 220 cases per year between 2008 and 2015.While more patients had benefited from organ transplants through these efforts, there is still room to further improve the organ transplant rate in Singapore. Singapore’s combined (both deceased and living) organ transplant rate for kidney was 20 per million population (pmp) in 2015. While our rate is higher than that of some developed countries such as Japan (at 13 pmp) and Hong Kong (at 11 pmp), it is lower than Australia (at 40 pmp) and the United Kingdom (at 49 pmp).Deceased organ donation is not only a complex medical process, but also a highly emotive and sensitive issue. Our doctors and healthcare staff are trained to be empathetic and considerate in attending to the grieving families. There are clinical protocols as well as ethical guidelines in place to facilitate the deceased organ donation process at the public hospitals. These ensure that the organ donation process is carried out in a timely, appropriate, and dignified manner, with family members constantly informed and attended to. MOH supports the regular training of doctors and healthcare staff involved in organ donation and a large part of the training focuses on the skills required in communicating sensitively and empathetically with family members.Improving organ donation goes beyond the roles played by the hospitals and healthcare staff. Social attitude and culture also play an important role. MOH will continue to promote greater awareness of organ donation and facilitate shifts in societal attitudes and views towards organ donation. As a follow-up to the ""Live On"" Campaign, MOH will be launching a new outreach campaign in the upcoming months on organ donation. Other efforts include expanding the training of more healthcare professionals on organ donation, working with doctors to raise organ failure patients’ awareness in considering living organ transplant as a treatment option, and encouraging individuals to share their decisions on organ donations with their loved ones. This will help their family members to understand and respect their decisions.Associate Professor Daniel Goh asked if it is timely for the Ministry to review the existing 'opt-out' consent model under the HOTA, and instead consider the 'mandated choice' policy, where individuals are required to indicate their preferences on organ donation while interacting with the Government on other matters. We understand that some countries have experimented with the 'mandated choice' policy with varying outcomes. Some states in the USA such as Montana and Illinois have adopted the mandated consent system with some success. However, other US states such as Texas, as well as Australia, eventually abandoned their mandated choice policy and reverted to an 'opt-in' consent model. It is not clear whether a mandated choice policy would have enhanced our organ donation rate. We need to study this carefully, taking into account the local context.Nonetheless, we will continue to reach out and encourage Singaporeans to support organ donation. Their gift will go a long way towards saving lives and easing the suffering of patients with organ failure."
standardised internal processes for financial institutions in monitoring and handling potential anti-money laundering cases,Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Prime Minister (a) whether the recently-announced dedicated Anti-Money Laundering (AML) department within MAS will standardise internal processes in all financial institutions with regard to monitoring and handling potential AML cases; and (b) in what ways will the enforcement functions of the new Enforcement Department be strengthened and how will these differ from past practice.,"Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has in place strict anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) rules for the financial sector. They are closely aligned with international standards.The rules require financial institutions to conduct robust ""know-your-customer"" (KYC) checks, monitor customers’ transactions on an ongoing basis, and file suspicious transaction reports with the Commercial Affairs Department when suspicious activities are detected. The task at hand is therefore not about imposing more or stricter rules, but strengthening the financial sector’s implementation of existing regulatory requirements.The recently established AML Department within MAS will consolidate and enhance our AML/CFT supervisory resources. It will provide a dedicated supervisory focus with regard to financial institutions’ compliance with MAS’ AML/CFT rules and raising industry standards. This consolidated function will engage actively with the industry to share perspectives on emerging money laundering and terrorism financing risks and typologies, as well as best practices in AML/CFT controls. It will also conduct more frequent, focused inspections of financial institutions identified as facing higher risks in this area. MAS will take regulatory actions against those financial institutions whose AML/CFT practices fall short of the expected standards. MAS will also make public its sanctions against persistently or egregiously errant financial institutions.While certain responsibilities such as robust KYC checks are common to all financial institutions, it is not possible to standardise AML/CFT frameworks, systems and processes. This is because different financial activities and institutions vary with regard to the nature of the business and their customer bases, and consequently face different money laundering and terrorism financing risks. The risk management systems and controls adopted by a financial institution should therefore be suited to its business and commensurate with its risk profile.With a financial centre that comprises more than 1,500 financial institutions, it is not possible to prevent regulatory breaches and misconduct, even with intrusive supervision. A strong enforcement capability is hence necessary to investigate and take swift action where there are breaches of the law. Enforcement helps shape the behaviour of market participants, by deterring unethical behaviour and complacency.The new Enforcement Department consolidates the current resources and expertise within MAS that is devoted to the investigation of breaches in the rules and regulations administered by MAS. The Department will expand its ambit beyond capital markets misconduct offences, to include the banking and insurance sectors. It will co-ordinate efforts with MAS supervisors in various sectors within the financial industry, to detect and investigate serious lapses or instances of misconduct.The Enforcement Department will also aggregate and review different pools of information from across different financial sectors to anticipate risks, identify patterns, and investigate potential misconduct and market abuses. The Department is stepping up the use of data analytics to enhance market surveillance, to help identify potential market misconduct and investigate specific offences.Together, the new departments will enhance MAS’ ability to anticipate, detect and investigate serious regulatory breaches, as well as tackle money laundering and terrorist financing risks as they continue to evolve."
help for growing companies as workforce tightens,"Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) in view of the ageing and shrinking of the local labour force and the tightening of foreign worker inflows, what are the Ministry's plans and measures to help local companies seeking to expand their business to do so.","Mr S Iswaran: The Government helps companies seeking to expand their business by supporting their innovation, productivity, and internationalisation efforts.Under the Automation Support Package (ASP), announced in Budget 2016, SPRING assists companies to undertake automation solutions by providing a grant of up to $1 million. SPRING also provides the Capability Development Grant (CDG) to support companies in building capabilities to innovate, enhance productivity and competitiveness.A*STAR and SPRING’s GET-Up Programme seconds senior research scientists and engineers (RSEs) from our universities, research institutes and polytechnics to SMEs. These senior RSEs help SMEs grow their business through innovation projects by enhancing their access to technologies and expertise.IE Singapore helps SMEs to internationalise through the Market Readiness Assistance (MRA) grant and Global Company Partnership (GCP). These programmes help to accelerate the international expansion and support the development of capabilities to venture into new markets.We are also developing Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) for over 20 sectors. These ITMs comprise growth and competitiveness plans for both domestically-oriented sectors (such as construction, food services, and retail) as well as export-oriented sectors (like hotels, logistics, food manufacturing, and precision engineering). These will include the programmes to upgrade productivity, develop skills, promote technology adoption & innovation, and help companies expand overseas.These efforts also require deep partnerships with Trade Associations and Chambers (TACs). For instance, IE Singapore has partnered the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCCI) to launch a Singapore Enterprise Centre in Shanghai. The Centre helps our SMEs venture into China by providing one-to-one advisory, organising business events, and sharing market information and business leads. We will also work with TACs on Collaborative Industry Projects (TAC-CIP) seeking scalable solutions to industry-specific productivity and innovation needs."
"co-ordination of works required for telephony, gas and utilities supply services under estate upgrading programme","Dr Tan Wu Meng asked the Minister for National Development what measures are undertaken under the Estate Upgrading Programme for private estates to better co-ordinate and expedite the works performed by external partners providing telephony, gas supply and other such utilities.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Every effort is made to co-ordinate and expedite the various types of work performed under the Estate Upgrading Programme. Attempts are made to coordinate EUP improvement works with other public works like drainage upgrading by PUB.For drainage upgrading in particular, this sometimes involves temporary disruptions to telecommunications, electrical and gas services. To minimise these disruptions, PUB engages residents prior to commencement of the works, while maintaining close coordination with external service providers. PUB also updates residents on the progress of the works.From time to time, external service providers may carry out road works like laying telecommunication lines, gas pipes or electrical cables. These service providers will have to seek LTA’s prior approval. If these providers have works along the same stretch of road, LTA will facilitate coordination between the parties and require them to stage their works sequentially. When the last party has completed its works, the affected stretch of road will then be properly resurfaced. This arrangement speeds up the entire process and minimises road occupation and inconvenience to road users and residents.I want to assure Members that for EUP construction projects, both PUB and LTA are involved in the EUP coordination meetings. The BCA/EUP consultant as the overall project coordinator, would then be alerted of other works affecting the project, and coordinate with the relevant parties on the works.I hope Members understand that while we aim to minimise inconvenience to residents, there will always be some level of dis-amenity and inconvenience while the works are in progress."
government construction projects awarded to local and foreign engineering companies,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Finance (a) in the last three years, how many Government construction projects have been awarded to local engineering companies and how many to foreign contractors for projects above $200 million; and (b) how many of these contracts have been awarded to the lowest tenderers.","Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam: The Building and Construction Authority (BCA) operates a Contractors Registration System which registers construction companies under various work categories and financial grades. All construction companies must be registered to qualify for the award of public tenders. This means that construction companies are first pre-qualified to ensure they meet certain standards before they can be awarded government contracts. In general, higher value construction contracts require companies to meet higher standards in terms of financial capacity, technical capability of the company and its personnel, company certifications and relevant track record. For example, companies bidding for construction contracts above $200 million will only compete amongst other companies which have attained similar or higher technical and financial standards.For construction contracts above $200 million awarded in the last three years, two-thirds were awarded to the lowest price bidder.As a signatory to the World Trade Organisation’s Agreement on Government Procurement (WTO-GPA) and various Free Trade Agreements, Singapore is required to ensure fair competition and non-discrimination between foreign or local suppliers. Our procurement regime is therefore an open one where suppliers compete based on their ability to meet tender requirements regardless of nationality. This applies also to competition to be on the prequalification list that I just referred to. For these reasons, BCA does not track the nationality of the ultimate owners of companies awarded tenders."
mandatory autism testing for babies,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry asked the Minister for Social and Family Development whether there are plans to do mandatory testing for autism for babies from 18 to 24 months old so that early intervention can be arranged to mitigate or reverse the condition.,"Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: Developmental paediatricians recommend that 2-3 years old is an optimal age range to diagnose moderate and severe forms of autism, as the symptoms may not be evident in children below that age. Milder cases of autism may not be diagnosed till the child is older.MOH issues every child born in Singapore with a Health Booklet that records their immunisation history and developmental screening progress. The Health Booklet includes developmental screening checklists at 4-8 weeks, 3-5 months, 6-12 months, 15-18 months, 2-3 years and 4-6 years. Red flags for developmental conditions, including autism, are incorporated in the screening checklists.Parents and caregivers would most likely be the first to realise if the child has developmental issues and can use the developmental milestones in the Health Booklet as reference points to guide them. In addition, when healthcare professionals such as doctors and nurses in the polyclinics, paediatricians and GPs detect delays in the child’s development during screenings and medical check-ups, they can refer the children to the Child Development Programme in KKH and NUH for diagnosis of developmental concerns. Parents who suspect that their children might be facing developmental delays can take their children to the nearest polyclinic, or the Department of Child Development (DCD) at KKH or NUH for assessment.Children who have been diagnosed with moderate to severe autism will be referred to the Early Intervention Programme for Infants and Children (EIPIC) for early intervention services."
take-up rate for partnerships for capability transformation scheme,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (a) what is the take-up rate of the Partnerships for Capability Transformation (PACT) scheme designed to encourage large companies to help their local SME suppliers to upgrade their capabilities; and (b) whether there are plans to improve and enhance this scheme.,"Mr S Iswaran: The PACT scheme, administered by EDB and SPRING, supports partnerships between large enterprises and SMEs by upgrading suppliers’ capabilities through the sourcing and qualification process. The scheme has helped locally-based suppliers enter growth industries such as aerospace, medical technology and semiconductor equipment. For instance, PACT has enabled locally-based suppliers to get onto the approved vendor lists of large enterprises through supplier qualification.EDB and SPRING have supported close to 130 PACT projects since 2010, from which over 700 Singapore-based suppliers have benefited. Over 650 of the 700 suppliers are local SMEs.The Government has continually reviewed the PACT scheme to ensure its relevance. In 2013, the scheme was expanded to cover new sectors such as food manufacturing, printing, retail, food services. At the same time, PACT was enhanced to support productivity improvements, knowledge transfer and test-bedding of innovative solutions. In 2015, the scheme was further extended to cover a broader spectrum of co-innovation activities, to include joint product development between the large enterprise and the supplier at the proof-of-concept stage. The Government will continue to monitor and review how the scheme can be further enhanced to support our local SMEs."
estate upgrading programme for private estates,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the current status of the Estate Upgrading Programme (EUP) for private estates; (b) what are the considerations taken into account in deciding on EUP projects; and (c) how does the Government allocate resources between public and private estate upgrading and maintenance.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Since the Estate Upgrading Programme (EUP) was launched in 2000, MND has selected 63 private estates through nine batches of EUP, benefitting more than 46,000 households. We are currently working out the implementation plan for Batch 9 of the EUP. For Batch 10, MND will invite nominations from the Citizens’ Consultative Committees (CCCs) when we have a firm timeline to implement this.In selecting estates for EUP, we consider the age and physical conditions of the estate. We prioritise the older estates, which have greater need and more opportunities for significant improvement through the upgrading works. On average, around seven estates are selected in each EUP batch.The Government is committed to improving the infrastructure in both public and private estates. The pace of upgrading would depend on the resources and industry capacity available. MND also has to coordinate with other Government agencies planning upgrading works to minimise inconvenience to the residents."
reasons for recent occurrence of a cluster of tuberculosis cases,Dr Lily Neo asked the Minister for Health whether the recent occurrence of a cluster of tuberculosis cases is of alarming concern and whether he can provide an update on the reason for such occurrence.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Tuberculosis is usually spread by prolonged close contact with infected persons. The recent cluster, where a few cases of the same TB strain were discovered among residents of a single housing block, was highly unusual, as the TB Control Unit has so far not been able to uncover where some of the residents concerned could have had close interactions.As a precautionary measure, MOH worked with grassroots leaders to conduct TB screening for past and current residents of the block. Two of the residents screened had signs of active TB, are undergoing treatment, and are no longer infectious. Residents who had latent TB are not infectious, and the vast majority (9 in 10) of them will not develop active TB in their lifetime. We have advised them on the TB symptoms to look out for, and to report to the TB Control Unit for medical review if they develop such symptoms.Early detection and prompt treatment are essential to ensure effective control of TB infections."
student drop-out rate after completion of primary school education,"Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Acting Minister for Education (Schools) (a) in the past five years, how many students have dropped out of secondary school after completing their primary school education; and (b) what has been done to encourage these students to continue their secondary education.","Mr Ng Chee Meng: Our schools closely monitor students’ progression and their completion of secondary school education. The overall proportion of each Primary 1 cohort who dropped out at the secondary level has remained low, at less than 1% in the last five years. Schools have done well to keep the number of dropouts low over the years.To engage students in their studies and motivate them to learn and grow, our schools proactively build caring and supportive environments. They put in place programmes that enhance the quality of school experience for students. They also provide good pastoral care, Education and Career Guidance, and Character and Citizenship Education that help students learn, grow and develop a desire to lead a purposeful life and make informed choices about their future pathways.Schools closely monitor students at risk of dropping out and put in place intervention measures to support them. For example, schools organise the Time Out Programme, which provides enhanced guidance and support for at-risk students who are disengaged in schooling. Students are taken out of their regular classes and provided with a customised programme that aims to rekindle their desire to learn, and help them develop goals and purpose in their educational journey. The programme also helps them to cope with and overcome any personal, family or social problems that they might be faced with, before they rejoin their regular classes.MOE provides additional support to schools to strengthen the engagement of and support for students. This includes counsellors and Student Welfare Officers who help students with school attendance issues and motivate them to return to schools.Despite all efforts to engage our students and keep them in schools, some students still drop out of schools, and the reasons for their dropping out are complex. MOE thus taps on the expertise and networks of relevant agencies such as Central Youth Guidance Office, MSF, MHA, SPF, CNB, Self-Help Groups, Family Service Centres and Voluntary Welfare Organisations to support at-risk students.Parents are an essential partner in supporting the efforts of schools. They help to instil and reinforce the right values in our students, and provide support and encouragement to them. Schools will continue to engage parents through various platforms and partner them to support their child’s needs."
impact of private-hire car companies' demands on coe premiums,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Transport (a) how much has the aggressive bidding for COEs by private-hire car companies such as Uber and Grab affected demand and contributed to COE premium increases; (b) what is the reason for LTA's recent block of free access to bidders' information; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider creating a separate COE category for private-hire vehicles.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Since March this year, there has been an increase in the number of COE bids submitted by car rental companies, including those associated with private hire car services.Notwithstanding this, if we ignore the one-off increase in COE premiums after the loan regulations were eased in May this year, the market has remained relatively stable. Category A and B COE premiums fluctuated only within a narrow band of $3,000 over this period. This is because it is not the number of bids per se, but how aggressively these bids are priced, that drives COE premiums up. So far, car rental companies do not seem to have been bidding very aggressively.The bid enquiry function on LTA’s online COE bidding system is meant for bidders to access information on their own bids. It was never meant to be a means for people to pry into the bids of others. In response to feedback to better protect bidders’ privacy, LTA now requires company bidders to enter an acknowledgement code that is known only to them, after which they can access their own bidding information.Currently, privately-owned cars can be converted into private hire cars and vice versa, unlike taxis. If we create a separate COE category for private hire cars, we may have to disallow such conversion. This will limit the flexibility of the private hire car market to the detriment of commuters and of private hire car service providers. On the other hand, if we allow such conversion flexibility, it may lead to gaming and distortion of the COE market. LTA will continue to monitor the COE market and look further into this issue as needed."
tender evaluation method in procurement of manpower services at restructured hospitals and institutions,Ms K Thanaletchimi asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the Ministry exercises oversight of the tender evaluation method in the procurement of manpower services or outsourced services in the restructured hospitals and institutions; (b) whether these contracts comply with the Price-Quality Method (PQM) of evaluation with 70% allotted to quality and 30% allotted to price; and (c) what is the minimum duration and percentage of such contracts that conform to PQM out of the total awarded tenders in the last three years.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The procurement policies in our public healthcare institutions are guided by the same principles as those in the Singapore Public Service - transparency of process, open and fair competition, so as to secure best value for money. Our institutions also take reference from national advisories such as the Tripartite Advisory on Best Sourcing Practices. As long as these principles and advisories are observed, our institutions have the flexibility to design their procurement and tender evaluation processes.Therefore, while all our public healthcare institutions use the Price-Quality Method (PQM) to evaluate tender proposals, the emphasis on quality and price will differ depending on the nature, type and complexity of services being procured. For example, the weightage of quality used in the evaluation for manpower and outsourced services procurement is typically 60% to 80%. Where there is less need for differentiation in the quality of products and services being contracted, the price component may be weighted higher.Similarly, the duration of the contracts also vary. For multi-year contracts, some institutions make provisions for annual salary increment and performance bonus for manpower deployed. Outsourced workers in our public healthcare institutions such as cleaners, housekeepers, porters, and security guards are important partners in delivering good healthcare service. We recognise and value their contributions and will continue to bear this in mind in the way we tender for their services."
review of rice stockpile scheme given extreme weather changes,"Mr Chen Show Mao asked the Minister for National Development whether the Rice Stockpile Scheme and other measures under Singapore's Food Security Roadmap are robust enough to withstand climatic events such as the 2015-16 El Niño and associated drought and heatwave that have affected crop outputs in Thailand, Vietnam, India and elsewhere in Southeast and South Asia.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Under the Food Security Roadmap, import source diversification is a core strategy to strengthen our food supply resilience. By importing from various sources both far and near, we can minimise impact of climatic events in any source location on Singapore’s overall food supply. For instance, despite unfavourable weather conditions in Malaysia earlier this year, import quantities and prices of leafy vegetables have been relatively stable as traders were able to switch to other sources such as China.Local production of key food items such as eggs, leafy vegetables, and fish complements our source diversification strategy. AVA supports our farmers in their efforts to expand their food production capabilities, for example through the implementation of controlled-environment farming systems such as indoor farming that can protect our local production from adverse environment conditions. By raising farming productivity and ramping up local production in cost-effective ways, we can become more self-reliant in selected food items over time.Finally, besides diversification and local production, stockpiling can enhance food security in times of short-term shortage. The Government maintains a strategic rice stockpile, where importers are required to stockpile a certain proportion of commonly consumed rice varieties, such as White Rice. This buffers against supply disruptions."
means testing for medifund across restructured hospitals and specialist centres,"Dr Tan Wu Meng asked the Minister for Health (a) in the last three years, what proportion of Medifund recipients visit more than one public restructured hospital or public specialist centre in the same year; (b) what proportion of such recipients require more than one means test to qualify for Medifund across the restructured hospitals and specialist centres that they visit; and (c) to what extent are medical social worker records portable across restructured hospitals and specialist centres so as to expedite means testing for needy patients.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Medifund provides help for needy patients who require additional financial assistance with their healthcare bills after Government subsidies, MediShield Life claims and Medisave withdrawals. Over the last three years, about one in five Medifund recipients visited more than one public hospital or national specialty centre in a year.Eligibility for Medifund is determined by the Medifund Committee in each healthcare institution, based on assessment by medical social workers. Today, medical social workers across public healthcare institutions share information with one another in cases where the patient is known to require financial assistance across institutions. Medifund assistance is also extended to needy patients on the Public Assistance scheme, without requiring them to go through additional means-testing.MOH and the public healthcare institutions have been working on sharing of medical social worker case records. For example, under SingHealth’s One Medifund Assessment initiative which Dr Tan had spearheaded while he was working at the National Cancer Centre, Medifund patients only need to be assessed once at any of the SingHealth institutions. Last year, medical social workers across all public healthcare institutions also undertook a comprehensive review to streamline the Medifund assessment process and improve information sharing. The intent is to make it more convenient for Medifund patients who visit more than one institution, while allowing the Medifund Committee of each institution to continue having flexibility to decide on individual cases."
employment of stay-at-home mothers in public sector,"Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Prime Minister (a) whether the public sector hires or engages stay-at-home mothers (not staff who go on flexible work arrangements); (b) if no, whether the public sector agencies can engage them for selected categories of work which stay-at-home mothers can perform from home; and (c) if yes, how many stay-at-home mothers are currently hired in the public sector.","Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): Public service agencies offer a range of freelancing opportunities, from administration to research. Stay-at-home mothers with the relevant skills can apply for such work. However, we are unable to gauge their numbers among successful applicants as their family status is not a criteria for job selection.Beyond freelancing opportunities, public service agencies also offer mothers long-term careers. Where the nature of the jobs allow, mothers may apply to work on a part-time basis or telecommute from home. As at the end of 2015, about 5% of mothers working in the civil service are on part-time arrangements. An internal survey also showed that about one quarter of respondents who are mothers have telecommuted, including 10% who do so at least once a fortnight."
inclusion of cpf contribution in calculation of public transport affordability,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Transport why has employers' CPF contribution been added to the calculation of household income in the Ministry's key performance indicator of public transport affordability as set out in the FY2016/17 Budget Book.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: We use the findings in the Department of Statistics’ Household Expenditure Survey to calculate public transport affordability. The survey is conducted only once every five years. In the intervening years, we adjust the findings in the last available survey by the subsequent annual changes in national wages and public transport fares.The last available Household Expenditure Survey was in 2014. In the survey, employer CPF contributions were included in the computation of household incomes. Accordingly, the public transport affordability performance indicator in the FY2016/17 Budget Book also used household income with employer CPF contributions.Removing the CPF contributions from the computation does not alter the fact that public transport affordability has improved. Public transport expenditure as a component of second quintile household income fell from 2.5% in 2010 to 2.2% in 2015 if we include employer CPF contributions, and from 2.8% to 2.4% over the same period if we exclude employer CPF contributions."
private hire driver's vocational licence for permanent residents and work permit holders,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Transport why are permanent residents and work permit holders allowed to apply for a Private Hire Driver's Vocational Licence (PDVL).,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Today, traditional limousine companies and car rental companies employ Permanent Residents and work pass holders as drivers. Work pass holders are subject to work pass conditions stipulated by the Ministry of Manpower. They provide chauffeured services that can be chartered for trips like airport transfers and ferrying of VIPs at events. In order to not disrupt traditional limousine companies and car rental companies when the new regulatory regime is implemented, these Permanent Residents and work pass holders will also be able to apply for the Private Hire Car Driver Vocational Licence. However, Permanent Residents and work pass holders can only provide chauffeured services in the course of their employment under these car rental or limousine companies. This is unlike for Singaporeans, who can be Uber or GrabCar drivers as long as they are sole proprietors of a chauffeured services company. As we understand it, there are no work pass holders driving for Uber or Grab today."
lowering threshold for permissible noise from vehicles at expressways near residential areas,Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether LTA is ready to install noise barriers along expressways such as BKE and KJE which are very close to high density public housing at Bukit Panjang; and (b) whether LTA will look into lowering the threshold of permissible noise level emitted from motor vehicles on expressways that are near residential housing.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: LTA’s trial installations of noise barriers for roads will be completed by the end of this year. If effective, we will prioritise their installation at locations based on noise level and proximity to residential housing.The Land Transport Authority follows vehicular noise emission standards set and regulated by the National Environment Agency, and these are aligned with international norms."
increasing public education and penalties to encourage heavy vehicle drivers to use correct lanes,"Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what are the measures taken to educate drivers, especially of large heavy vehicles, to occupy the most appropriate lane based on their legislated speed limit; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider (i) imposing stiffer penalties on errant drivers of vehicles with legislated speed limit and on their companies if found speeding or driving at the wrong lanes (ii) having greater enforcement on errant drivers who flout speeding limits (iii) introducing the speed limiter blinking lights for vehicles with legislated speed limits and (iv) having a more rigorous course for drivers, especially work permit holders, assigned to drive heavy vehicles.","Mr K Shanmugam: The Traffic Police (TP) adopts a three-pronged strategy of education, engagement and enforcement, to promote safe driving by Heavy Vehicle drivers.On driver education, learner drivers, including those who drive heavy vehicles, are taught to occupy the most appropriate lane as part of the driving school syllabus.Heavy vehicle drivers go through a more rigorous course than other drivers in order to obtain their licence. One must have a Class 3 Driving Licence to apply for a Class 4 Licence, and have a Class 4 Licence to apply for a Class 5 Licence. Beyond the basic driving courses, employers are encouraged to send their heavy vehicle drivers for refresher or defensive driving courses offered by the driving schools.TP regularly engages heavy vehicle drivers on road safety and good driving practices. In 2016, TP partnered stakeholders, including vehicle inspection centres like VICOM, merchant associations, the Workplace Safety & Health Council, and the Ministry of Manpower to carry out an outreach campaign to educate heavy vehicle drivers.TP maintains a tough enforcement stance against errant drivers who flout speed limits and other traffic rules. In addition to fixed speed cameras, from early this year TP deployed mobile speed cameras and new police speed laser cameras to enhance its enforcement at speeding hotspots.Heavy vehicle drivers currently face stiffer penalties for traffic offences as compared to other drivers. Heavy vehicle drivers caught exceeding the speed limit by up to 40 kilometres per hour will be given fines ranging from $160 to $200 and 4 to 8 demerit points. Heavy vehicle drivers caught exceeding the speed limit by more than 40 kilometres per hour will be charged in court and given 12 to 24 demerit points.In addition, all heavy vehicles with maximum laden weight exceeding 12 tonnes for goods vehicles and 10 tonnes for public service vehicles are required by law to be installed with speed limiters, which restrict their maximum speed to 60 kilometres per hour. Such vehicle owners are required to send their vehicles for annual inspections at registered vehicle inspection centres to ensure that the speed limiters are in working condition. Heavy vehicles with speed limiters are also required to undergo additional speed limiter inspections, if these vehicles were caught speeding. Those caught tampering with their speed limiters can be fined up to $1,000 or imprisoned up to three months, while repeat offenders can be fined up to $2,000 or imprisoned up to six months.TP and LTA are reviewing measures to further curb heavy vehicle traffic violations and will announce the changes in due course."
construction of portable ramps at entrances to old hdb flats,Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry will consider (i) allowing residents living in old HDB flats with multi-step entrances the option of renting portable ramps from HDB and complementing this option with retrofitting the flats with permanent ramps and (ii) decentralising the budget and approval process to the respective HDB Branch Offices or Community Development Councils with inputs from grassroots leaders for such initiatives to be rolled out.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: As Mr Ang is aware, some older HDB flats built in the 1970s and 1980s were designed with multiple-stepped entrances to offer more privacy and added security for occupants of the flats. However, with an ageing population, elderly residents and wheelchair users in these units may now face difficulties negotiating the steps.HDB has been studying this issue carefully. Any solution will likely have to be customised to the flat configuration, corridor space availability and the residents’ needs, without posing maintenance issues or obstructing the fire escape route. Different solutions will likely be needed for flats with different locational conditions, and it may not be practical for HDB to stock up and rent out ramps. Nonetheless, HDB will take the Member’s suggestion into consideration in its ongoing study.When we have developed the appropriate solutions, we could implement them as an expansion of EASE or through other programmes. HDB is exploring with other agencies/authorities the financial assistance that could be provided for low income families who may need such ramps or platforms.Meanwhile, residents who wish to engage a private vendor to install ramps today can approach the HDB Branches. HDB is exploring how to make it easier for residents to get the necessary approvals to install the ramps. Those who need financial assistance for the ramp installation may also approach VWOs or their Advisers for assistance."
complaints of second-hand smoke from neighbours at hdb flats,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) for the past five years, how many cases of feedback have been received each year from residents against other residents smoking at their own flat's window or common corridor being affected by the second-hand smoke; and (b) whether NEA has plans to address this issue.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: My Ministry’s long term goal is to prohibit smoking in all public areas to protect non-smokers from the harmful health effects of second-hand smoke. Since 2013, smoking has been prohibited in common areas within any residential developments, including common corridors, staircases and staircase landings of HDB and private residential developments. Those who smoke in the common corridors of residential buildings are liable to a maximum court fine of $1,000.In 2013, my Ministry received about 470 cases of feedback regarding smoking in residential premises. This decreased to about 420 cases in 2014 and 320 cases in 2015. In addition, there were about 2,500 cases of feedback on smoking in common corridors in 2013. This decreased to about 2,100 cases in 2014 and 2,000 cases in 2015.Smoking within one’s own residence, which is considered private, is not prohibited and beyond the Government's jurisdiction. Nonetheless, we recognise that second-hand smoke from residential premises can waft into neighbours’ residences. Smokers are thus encouraged to be socially responsible and considerate when smoking so as not to cause disamenities to their surroundings and neighbours. Where necessary, residents who are affected by smoke from their neighbours’ residences or common corridors can discuss and resolve the issue with their neighbours amicably or seek assistance from the Community Mediation Centre to facilitate constructive resolution of issues."
preventing youths from purchasing sexual services,Mr Zaqy Mohamad asked the Acting Minister for Education (Schools) whether it has plans to address the increasing trend of youths purchasing sexual services in Singapore and abroad.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: Recent newspaper reports based on a study on adolescents having sex with sex workers in Singapore may have given the mis-impression that there is an increasing trend for all youths. The study did not demonstrate such a trend and was not designed to do so. The participants for the study were adolescents seeking treatment at the Department of Sexually Transmitted Infections Control Clinic. It was not a time-trend study of a representative sample of the youth population in Singapore. Nonetheless, the issue raised by the member and the study about youth sexuality are important, and should be taken seriously.MOE’s current Sexuality Education programme already has elements to mitigate youth paying for sexual services. The programme seeks to equip all students with knowledge, skills and attitudes toa. understand their physiological, social and emotional changes as they mature;b. develop healthy and rewarding relationships; andc. make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters. This includes information about Sexuality Transmitted Infections and how one can be protected from them.Schools also provide additional support, such as one-to-one counselling, to students at risk of sexual experimentation or are already engaging in sexual activity. As parents play a key role in sexuality education, schools will also engage parents to discuss joint intervention plans. Where required, schools will engage community partners and external agencies with specialised expertise."
pay-as-you-bid system for coes,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the average price of the highest COE bid for vehicles in all the categories in the last three bidding exercises; (b) what is the average price of the winning COE bid in the same period; and (c) what are the considerations in not implementing a pay-as-you-bid system for COEs.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The average price of the winning COE bid in the last three bidding exercises was $52,601 for Category A, $57,167 for Category B, $48,694 for Category C, $6,173 for Category D, and $57,235 for Category E. The average of the highest COE bid, after removing outlier bids which were likely due to errors, was $64,296 for Category A, $79,629 for Category B, $60,967 for Category C, $10,000 for Category D, and $69,130 for Category E. This comparison, however, is not very meaningful. The vast majority of successful bids are clustered within 10% of the final strike price.The idea of a pay-as-you-bid system was last reviewed in 2013. Economists such as NTU professor Ng Yew Kwang, advised that a pay-as-you-bid system may not necessarily result in lower COE prices as clearing prices would still be determined by demand and supply. In addition, they pointed that a pay-as-you-bid system encourages gaming in that bidders will be constantly adjusting their bids in accordance with how they think others will bid, so that they do not end up over-paying. Market insiders will have a clear advantage. In contrast, the current COE auction system encourages a bidder to submit a single bid at the true price that he is willing to pay. This is simpler and fairer to car buyers who are less familiar with the market."
extending non-smoking zones in selective public areas in punggol,Ms Sun Xueling asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether NEA will consider extending the demarcation of non-smoking areas in selective public areas in Punggol that are outside of the list of smoke-free areas covered under the Smoking (Prohibition in Certain Places) Act so as to protect our children from secondhand smoke.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The Government’s long term goal is to prohibit smoking in all public areas to protect non-smokers from the harmful health effects of second-hand smoke.Since the implementation of the Smoking (Prohibition in Certain Places) Act in 1970, the smoking prohibition has been progressively extended to more than 32,000 premises and locations including general areas such as playgrounds, corridors, covered walkways, lift lobbies, stairwells and entrances to buildings. From 1 June 2016, the smoking prohibition was extended, after taking into consideration views from the public, to cover areas such as neighbourhood parks within both public and private residential estates which are places likely to be frequented by families and children.It would not be appropriate for my Ministry to prescribe selective smoking-prohibited areas in specific constituencies outside of the list of areas covered under the Smoking (Prohibition in Certain Places) Act as this may result in confusion or inconsistency over the Government’s policy towards smoking prohibition in public places.Nonetheless, my Ministry will continue to take the public’s feedback into consideration as we look into further extending the smoking prohibition under the Smoking (Prohibition in Certain Places) Act."
referral by private general practitioners of non-emergency cases to government accident and emergency departments,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the average percentage of patients referred by private GPs to Accident and Emergency (A&E) Departments in Government hospitals and not warded; and (b) how can the Government better help such patients from being subjected to excessive medical charges as they would be billed by the GP and A&E Department for the same illness.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: In 2015, around 39,000 patients were referred by general practitioners (GPs) to the Accident and Emergency (A&E) departments of public hospitals. About 70% of them were not required to be warded after being assessed and treated by the A&E doctors.We should not assume that a patient who is not warded has been inappropriately referred by his GP. These patients may require further review or monitoring in the A&E setting. They may also require additional tests or treatment using specialised instruments that are not available at the GP clinics. For the large majority of patients, the A&E referrals by their GPs are appropriate for their medical conditions.Our Regional Health Systems and Restructured Hospitals will continue to work closely with their GP partners to provide good quality primary care, and to minimise the need for Singaporeans to seek treatment at acute hospitals."
enhancing last-mile connectivity with shelters to link commercial buildings to mrt stations and bus stops,Mr Darryl David asked the Minister for Transport whether further measures can be taken to enhance last-mile connectivity with regard to shelters that link private/commercial buildings and properties to bus stops and MRT stations.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Today, there are already 66 km of sheltered walkways connecting our public transport nodes to key amenities such as shopping malls, as well as to offices and residences. LTA is adding another 140km as part of its Walk2Ride programme. Furthermore, from 1 July 2016, private developers must submit a Walking and Cycling Plan when applying to URA for planning permission. This will ensure that they provide, where appropriate, for sheltered connections to bus stops and MRT stations in the design or redevelopment of their buildings."
take-up rate by students for spanish as third language,"Mr Darryl David asked the Acting Minister for Education (Schools) whether Spanish is offered as a third language option to students in our schools and, if so, what is the take-up rate of Spanish as compared to the other third language options.","Mr Ng Chee Meng: Spanish was introduced in 2014 as one of the foreign languages available to eligible students.Currently, about 100 students would offer Spanish as a third language each year at Secondary 1. This intake level is typical of foreign languages that are newly introduced. The Secondary 1 intake size for other foreign languages varies, ranging from about 240 for German to about 550 for Japanese."
re-designing home team jobs,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Home Affairs how are Home Team departments re-designing their jobs so that Home Team officers' efforts can be more productive and older officers can continue to be productive even in their later years.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The Home Team works in a dynamic operating environment. We face evolving threats and challenges which require us to develop new concepts of operations and capabilities. There are also new opportunities presented by innovation and advances in technology. We therefore regularly review and re-design our jobs in the Home Team to ensure they remain relevant in supporting our mission.For example, the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) has redesigned the job of the Fire Rescue Specialist. Their Fire Rescue Specialists are now dual-trained in both fire-fighting skills and emergency medical technician (EMT) skills. With the EMT skills, our fire fighters can also attend quickly to victims of fire and trauma incidents. This allows SCDF the flexibility of deploying a single set of personnel for both fire and rescue and improves the overall effectiveness of its operations. Our fire fighters benefit as well. They are now equipped with a wider range of professional skills.The Home Team also leverages innovation and technology to increase the productivity of our officers. For example, the Police Coast Guard (PCG) is exploring the use of Unmanned Surface Vessels (USVs) to carry out localised surveillance patrols, project presence and intercept intruding vessels to enhance its response capabilities. With the use of USVs, the focus of PCG officers will be on critical maritime functions such as conducting anti-smuggling checks on vessels, without compromising security coverage and control of our waters.The Home Team values the experience, skills and knowledge of our officers. The development of our officers is therefore a key priority, in particular to help them take on new roles and re-designed jobs effectively, In addition, we have also taken steps to retrain and redeploy older officers. For instance, in the Singapore Prisons Service (SPS), older officers with their wealth of knowledge are re-trained to take up new roles as Reintegration Officers to supervise offenders after their release into the community.Job redesign is an on-going effort to ensure our jobs remain relevant and challenging and to enable Home Team officers to contribute effectively. This way, the Home Team can continue to keep Singapore safe and secure."
prevention of shop thefts by youths,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is the general profile of youths caught for shop thefts; (b) what are the common reasons given by these youths for committing shop thefts; and (c) what are the targeted measures in place to address the root causes of shop thefts by youths.,"Mr K Shanmugam: 838 youths were arrested in 2015 for shop theft. 58% of those arrested were male and 74% were first-time offenders. The trend has remained roughly stable compared to previous years.These youths may have committed shop theft for a variety of reasons. Some did it for material gains, while others were influenced by peers.Youth crime, including shop theft, is a multi-faceted problem, and we need to tackle it on multiple fronts. Besides law enforcement agencies, schools, retailers, the social services sector, parents and youths themselves, all play a role in reducing youth crime.The National Committee on Youth Guidance and Rehabilitation (NYGR) was established in 1995 as an inter-agency committee to reduce juvenile delinquency and youth crime. Since its formation, the Committee has supported several developmental, prevention and rehabilitation programmes to reach out and help youths-at-risk. For example, parenting programmes organised by schools, Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs), grassroots organisations and community clubs help parents to discipline as well as instill the right values in their children.Police have been working with schools to raise awareness among youths on the consequences of committing crime. These efforts include school talks, crime prevention exhibitions and Youth Engagement Programmes (YEP), which engage at-risk students through meaningful activities such as soccer leagues.Police have also enhanced their crime prevention outreach using more interactive modes. One example is the installation of interactive touch-screen game panels at bus stops near youth congregation areas like the ‘Scape’ youth park, to spread anti-shop theft messages to our youths."
special needs children in mainstream schools,Ms Sun Xueling asked the Acting Minister for Education (Schools) (a) what percentage of special needs children are currently receiving education in mainstream schools and in special education schools; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider building more special needs schools in housing areas with a higher proportion of children and hence a likely higher proportion of special needs children.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: Students with special educational needs (SEN) are enrolled in both mainstream and Special Education (SPED) schools. Currently, there are about 18,000 students who have learning difficulties or mild special educational needs enrolled in mainstream schools, comprising about 75% of all students diagnosed with SEN. Those with moderate to severe SEN are supported in SPED schools run by Government-funded Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs). These schools are equipped with special facilities as well as specially trained teachers and allied professionals to meet the needs of their students who require a customised curriculum and specialised interventions.As part of the continual effort to meet the evolving needs of children with special needs and enhance the learning environment in SPED schools, MOE has over the years supported and funded the setting up of new SPED schools and the expansion of existing ones to enhance accessibility to quality SPED.The 20 Government-funded SPED schools run by VWOs collectively serve a range of disability profiles, and are organised primarily by disability types and the programmes they provide to meet the needs of their students. The SPED schools are geographically distributed across Singapore and the majority are currently located in public housing areas with access to public transport.MOE will continue to work closely with the VWOs in monitoring the SPED school vacancy and infrastructural situation to ensure that students with disabilities have timely access to SPED. Where there is a need for additional school campuses to cater to students with specific disabilities, we will continue to site them in locations where there is ease of access by students and their parents/care-givers."
using forensics data analysis to curb recalcitrant high-rise littering culprits,Ms Tin Pei Ling asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether forensics such as DNA analysis can be made use of to identify recalcitrant high-rise littering culprits so as to curb such highly anti-social behaviours.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: High-rise littering is an anti-social and serious offence that dirties the environment and poses safety hazards to the public.Forensics such as DNA analysis may provide evidence that a person has had contact with a particular piece of litter thrown but this does not directly prove the act of littering. Further investigation would still be necessary to establish the identity of the high-rise littering culprit and prove that the person had indeed thrown the litter. It may also be challenging to extract DNA samples from litter that has been exposed to weather elements. Nonetheless, my Ministry is exploring the possibility of using DNA forensics in our enforcement against high-rise littering and will study if there are situations where such technology may be of use.My Ministry has deployed surveillance cameras in areas with persistent high-rise littering to catch high-rise litterbugs in the act since 2012. When a particular unit from which items have been thrown has been identified, the owner of the unit will be compelled by law to furnish information on the identities of the occupants for our further investigation and necessary enforcement action. More than 2,400 enforcements have been taken against high-rise littering offenders since we started camera deployments in 2012.The Government takes a serious view of high-rise littering. We will, as far as practicable, continue to adopt the necessary measures and technology to tackle high-rise littering to secure the conviction of high-rise litterbugs."
update on implementation and take-up rate of parenthood provisional housing scheme,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development (a) how many families have benefited from the Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme (PPHS) since its launch; (b) how many of these families have since moved out to their new HDB flats; (c) how many families co-share with another family temporarily in one flat and how many are without co-sharing; (d) how many families have made appeals for rental reductions and what is the number of successful and non-successful appeals respectively; and (e) whether more flats will be made available for PPHS.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: About 1,860 families have benefited from the Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme (PPHS) since its launch in January 2013. 630 families have since moved into their new HDB flats.Almost all families in PPHS do not co-share. So far, only 16 families have taken up the co-sharing option since its introduction in November 2014.Overall, 28 families have appealed for rental reductions. HDB encourages families who appeal for lower rent to consider co-sharing with another eligible family. For those in financial hardship, HDB may assist them with Interim Rental Housing (IRH) which has even lower rents. Of the 28 families, HDB assisted 22 families with these measures or by transferring them to a PPHS flat with a lower rent. The remaining 6 chose to remain in their PPHS flats.From June 2015, we increased the PPHS supply by about 800 flats. Currently, we have about 1,950 PPHS flats in total. We will continue to review the supply considering the availability of flats and demand for PPHS. Thus far, the supply has been sufficient to meet demand."
number of offenders arrested for loan sharking and illegal money lending activities,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Home Affairs for each of the past five years, what has been (i) the number of loan shark harassment cases reported (ii) the number of offenders who have been arrested for offences relating to loan shark harassment and illegal money lending activities and charged in court and (iii) the number of offenders who have been sentenced to imprisonment and caning respectively.","Mr K Shanmugam: UML-related cases registered a 10-year low in 2015.There were 4,862 UML cases reported in 2015. These include UML harassment cases, as well as other UML-related cases, for instance, carrying on or assisting in a UML business. This was a 25.8% reduction when compared to 2014. The number of cases has come down substantially, to about a quarter of the cases reported at the peak in 2009 when there were 18,649 cases.The number of persons arrested for UML related cases decreased by 8.6% from 1,643 persons in 2014 to 1,501 persons in 2015. This is a decline from the 1,981 arrests in 2011.In the period from 2011 to 2015, a total of 2,845 persons were sentenced to imprisonment and caning by the Courts.Under the Moneylenders Act, an individual who acts as a UML, or assists the UML to conduct his business, shall be sentenced on conviction to a fine of up to $300,000, 7 years imprisonment, and 12 strokes of the cane. An individual who commits UML harassment shall be sentenced on conviction to a fine of up to $60,000, 9 years imprisonment, and 18 strokes of the cane.Police will continue to take a tough approach and clamp down on all manner of UML activities."
approval process for flat owners subsidies under hdb's goodwill repair assistance scheme,"Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the current policy and approval process for granting flat owners subsidies under HDB's Goodwill Repair Assistance Scheme; and (b) whether MPs and grassroot advisors have a role to play in this process and, if so, what is their role.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Flat owners are responsible for the maintenance of the interior of their flats. This includes the repair of spalling concrete and ceiling leaks. They will also have to bear the cost of the repair works.If the leak or spalling concrete is due to wear and tear, flat owners can request for assistance under the Goodwill Repair Assistance (GRA) scheme, where HDB will arrange for the repair and co-pay 50% of the repair cost.As this a nation-wide scheme, the network of Government-appointed Advisors help outreach, ground assessment and to check that the flats are eligible for repairs under the GRA. HDB also welcomes feedback from all Members of Parliament (MPs) should they encounter such cases among their residents."
easing congestion and traffic bottlenecks on kpe,Ms K Thanaletchimi asked the Minister for Transport whether there are measures in place to ease congestion and allow for smoother traffic at the KPE as the morning traffic is very heavy due to the bottleneck created by queues of cars exiting to Airport Road.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: LTA will adjust traffic light timings at some of the junctions along Airport Road to help ease the congestion at this exit. We have increased the capacity of the North-East MRT Line and also introduced more bus services in the northeast, and would encourage motorists to switch to public transport."
payment of cpf contributions and workfare income supplement to prison inmates and disabled adults,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Ministry mandates the payment of CPF contributions and Workfare Income Supplement to (i) prison inmates who undergo in-prison training to get them ready for work as well as those who undergo work programmes in prison; and (ii) disabled adults at organisations like the Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore who do work for social enterprise programmes.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: In general, all Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents are required to make CPF contributions if they earn an income from two categories of work in Singapore.i. The first category refers to those who are working under Contracts of Service, where there is an employee-employer relationship, and who earn more than $50 per month.ii. The second category refers to those who are Self-Employed Persons and whose net trade income is more than $6,000 per year.CPF contributions are mandated for persons with disabilities who do work for social enterprise programmes if the work arrangements fall under the two categories above. For example, the centres run by the Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore (MINDS) currently enable the training of persons with disabilities in social enterprises. There is no employer-employee relationship between MINDS and the person with disabilities. CPF contributions are not required to be made by or on behalf of these persons with disabilities.Work programmes in prison are part of the overall inmate rehabilitation programme. The work programmes serve to keep the inmates meaningfully occupied during their prison term, and prepare inmates for employment upon their release. Participation in such work programme is voluntary and inmates can ask to cease participation at any time. Prison inmates do not work under a Contract of Service, and there is no employer-employee relationship between the Government and the inmate. CPF contributions are not required to be made by or on behalf of these prison inmates.The Workfare Income Supplement, or WIS, supplements the income and CPF savings of eligible Singaporeans aged 35 and above. This age criterion for WIS is waived for persons with disabilities.Persons with disabilities can qualify for WIS if they make the necessary CPF contributions in line with their work arrangements. Prison inmates who participate in work programmes can likewise qualify for WIS if they make the necessary contributions to their CPF Medisave accounts."
regulations for f&b outlets to display calorie and nutrition information on menus,Mr Zaqy Mohamad asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry will consider regulations for food and beverage outlets to display calorie and nutrition information in their menus as part of its war on diabetes and countering rising obesity.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Evidence from other countries suggests that requiring calorie labels on menus can be effective in reducing the number of calories consumed, if consumers are aware of the labels and understand how to use them. Calorie labels also help to incentivise food and beverage businesses to modify their recipes and offer lower calorie options on their menus.We have made some progress on this front in Singapore. Restaurants such as Dian Xiao Er and The Soup Spoon have shown the calorie values for all their menu items. Food court operators like Kopitiam have also done so at selected outlets. Other operators, such as Foodfare and Koufu, highlight the calorie value of their healthier dishes, while McDonald's and Subway provide calorie information online. There is scope to do more in this area and we will continue to work with the food and beverage industry, to provide Singaporeans with a larger variety of healthier meal options.The Diabetes Prevention and Care Taskforce will study Mr Zaqy Mohamad's proposal in consultation with our stakeholders, including hawkers and small businesses, and look at how we can balance the benefits and associated costs of implementation. I thank the Member for his suggestion."
incentives and grants to help construction companies manage labour costs,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for National Development given the construction sector's heavy reliance on foreign manpower, what are the specific incentives and grants available to help businesses in the construction sector, especially SMEs, to cope with the increase in the foreign worker levy.","Mr Lawrence Wong: To shift the construction industry away from a reliance on foreign manpower, BCA uses a combination of higher foreign worker levy and grants and incentives to encourage the adoption of productive construction methods.Since 2010, close to $800 million of funding has been made available to firms through the Construction Productivity and Capability Fund (CPCF). The CPCF supports firms in the built environment sector in areas of workforce development and technology adoption. To date, $400 million have been committed to fund projects undertaken by more than 8,000 firms, of which 90% are small and medium-sized firms.The Workforce Training and Upgrading Scheme, funded through the CPCF, provides up to 90% funding support for firms to upgrade their local employees. Firms can also receive up to 80% funding support to train and upgrade their Basic Skilled R2 workers, to Higher Skilled R1 workers. In addition, there is a suite of scholarship and sponsorship programmes to help firms attract and develop their local workforce.Besides worker training, companies can also receive funding support to mechanise their operations, and adopt productive technologies and processes.We encourage the industry to continue tapping on the incentives and grants available to improve construction productivity."
impact of starting train operations later on sundays on workers,Ms K Thanaletchimi asked the Minister for Transport with the delayed commencement of MRT trains affecting 13 train stations on Sundays with effect from June (a) how many commuters especially workers will be affected; (b) whether more bus services will ply along the train route with minimum inconvenience to workers commencing work at 7 am or earlier; and (c) whether the Ministry will work with the affected sectors such as the hospitals to assist healthcare workers commuting via public transport and who commence work at 7 am.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The temporary change in operating hours on Sunday mornings may affect about 13,000 passengers. I would like to thank the affected commuters for their understanding and patience. The additional hour per week will allow the train maintenance staff to speed up the on-going track renewal works.LTA has assessed that there are adequate bus services plying the affected stretch. Nonetheless, we will be adding an interim bus service, with a frequency of 10 minutes, running between Bukit Gombak and Joo Koon via Jurong East. We will monitor the situation closely and adjust our measures to mitigate the impact on commuters."
extension of free mrt travel to ease peak-hour travel,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the free travel to CBD MRT stations will be extended in its coming review; (b) how many commuters have benefitted from this scheme since it was launched; (c) what is the percentage of improvement it has contributed to peak-hour travel; and (d) whether the scheme can be extended to more stations in non-CBD areas serving the industrial and business parks.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: We recently announced that the Free Pre-peak Travel scheme will be extended to June 2017. Around 65,000 commuters benefit from the scheme daily. The number of morning peak hour exits at the designated city centre stations has fallen by about 7%, with the ratio of peak to pre-peak exits falling from 2.7 to 2.1.The Free Pre-peak Travel scheme is aimed at reducing crowding along the most congested stretches of our rail network during the morning peak period, which are primarily city-bound trips. We started the Travel Smart Rewards Programme to complement the Free Pre-peak Travel scheme. Under Travel Smart, commuters travelling to MRT stations outside the city area can earn credits for travelling outside peak periods. For commuters who consistently travel off-peak, the Off-Peak Monthly Travel Passes offer further discounts over the regular monthly travel passes."
automatic pr status for foreign spouses of singapore citizens with one singapore citizen child,Ms Tin Pei Ling asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether foreign spouses of Singapore citizens and who have at least one Singapore citizen child together can be granted permanent residence automatically after a specified period of time so that the Singaporean family can be complete and stable.,"Mr K Shanmugam: Permanent Residence (PR) is not automatically granted to foreigners who are married to Singaporean Citizens (SCs). Each PR application is evaluated holistically on a range of criteria such as the financial ability of the SC spouse to support the foreign spouse. The fact that there are SC children from the marriage would be a plus factor.Foreign spouses who do not qualify for PR yet may be granted a Long-Term Visit Pass (LTVP) or Long Term Visit Pass-Plus (LTVP+) for them to remain in Singapore with their families. Those who are granted LTVP and LTVP+ are allowed to seek employment to help support their families.In 2015, ICA implemented the Pre-Marriage LTVP Assessment (PMLA). The PMLA provides greater clarity, prior to marriage, on whether the foreign spouse can qualify for long term stay in Singapore. It helps prospective Singaporean-foreigner couples better plan for the future. Prospective Singaporean-foreigner couples are strongly encouraged to undergo the PMLA before marriage."
cycling for students,Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Acting Minister for Education (Schools) (a) whether the Ministry will offer cycling lessons among its list of activities for students in primary and secondary schools; and (b) whether there is any survey done to find out what percentage of our students cycle to schools.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: MOE’s primary focus on cycling is on safety. As part of the Physical Education curriculum in primary schools, students learn about personal safety and safety of others as a cyclist, as well as a pedestrian. This is taught in Primary 3. In addition, MOE is collaborating with Land Transport Authority to offer a cycling safety enrichment programme to students in Secondary Schools who are able to cycle. This would be a voluntary programme where students would be taught safe cycling practices. We currently have no specific plans to offer cycling lessons in our schools beyond this cycling safety enrichment programme.MOE has not carried out any survey on the number of students who cycle to school. From schools' observations, this number is small. Nevertheless, MOE will continue to work with partner agencies such as Land Transport Authority and Traffic Police to improve road safety infrastructure around schools to keep our students and other road users safe, including students who cycle to school. MOE will also continue to monitor the traffic situation and design programmes to promote student safety."
making overhead pedestrian bridges elder- and disabled-friendly,"Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for Transport (a) to date, what is the number of overhead bridges that have lifts; and (b) what are the alternative solutions to make overhead bridges, especially those found in mature estates, elderly and handicap friendly if lifts and ramps cannot be installed for some reason.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Today, 33 pedestrian overhead bridges have lifts. LTA is installing lifts at 34 more bridges by 2018, and 50 more bridges after that. We will then review the situation for the subsequent phases. We will prioritise bridges near places such as transport hubs, hospitals, polyclinics, welfare homes, homes for the aged, and schools for children with special needs.For bridges that are regularly used by the elderly and physically disabled, if it is impossible to install lifts because of location constraints, we will explore alternatives like street-level crossings."
enforcement actions against cluttering of common space at hdb flats and estates,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked the Minister for National Development whether there are national level plans to take enforcement action on the cluttering issue in common spaces of HDB flats and housing estates.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Town Councils manage and maintain common areas in HDB estates. They enforce by-laws that regulate the use of the common property, including the placing of objects at common areas. These by-laws are typically guided by Singapore Civil Defence Force's guidelines on fire safety.HDB as well as many Town Councils also carry out public education to remind residents about the risk posed by clutter in common areas.At the same time, residents can play their part by keeping the common areas clean and free from clutter, to ensure a safe living environment for all."
recent spate of residential fires,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) how many residential fires happened in the first four months of this year; (b) whether this is higher or lower than the number of residential fires reported over the same period of the last two years; (c) what are the main causes of the recent residential fires; (d) what is SCDF doing to increase awareness on preventing residential fires; and (e) what percentage of homes currently own a fire extinguisher.,"Mr K Shanmugam: There were 955 residential fires in the first four months of 2016, about 6% and 10% lower than the same period in 2015 and 2014 respectively.About 98% of the residential fires this year are small-scale fires which did not result in casualties. About 50% of these fires were caused by the indiscriminate disposal of lighted materials, such as lighted cigarettes and charcoal embers, down the rubbish chute or into rubbish bins at common areas. Unattended cooking, which accounted for about 20% of the recent residential fires, is the second main cause.A large number of residential fires can therefore be prevented with better awareness of fire safety at home. To increase awareness, the SCDF actively promotes fire safety and public education messages through community-based programmes and initiatives. Residents participate in fire drills at Emergency Preparedness Day Events, and learn emergency preparedness skills such as operating a fire extinguisher when they take part in the Community Emergency Preparedness Programme. The SCDF also disseminates fire safety advisories to homes, and regularly collaborates with grassroots organisations to include articles on fire hazards and fire safety tips in their newsletters and magazines.The SCDF does not monitor the percentage of homes that currently own a fire extinguisher. Fire extinguishers are sold by private vendors who are not required to report their sales to the SCDF. However, the SCDF encourages each household to be equipped with a fire extinguisher to be prepared for fire emergencies. This message is regularly emphasised through SCDF's community-based initiatives as well as in fire safety advisories."
efficient deployment of buses during train breakdowns to minimise disruption to commuters,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry (i) monitors whether sufficient buses are deployed at each affected MRT station during breakdowns and whether these buses are deployed efficiently enough to minimise disruption to commuters; and (ii) takes these two factors into consideration in evaluating the performance of the operators.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: If bus bridging services are required during a service disruption, the rail operators must comply with the standards set out in LTA's Code of Practice. These include the time taken for the bus bridging services to be activated and deployed, as well as the headways for such services. LTA monitors the deployment of these services through officers on the ground and from the Land Transport Operations Centre. If the operators fail to deploy the bus bridging services adequately or appropriately, they may be penalised.However, we should be realistic about the effectiveness of bus bridging services during any large-scale service disruption. The capacity of a bus is much smaller than that of a train. It takes almost 20 buses to carry the load of one train. Hence, the only satisfactory way forward is to improve the reliability of our train system, reduce frequency of disruptions, avoid large scale disruptions, speed up fault identification and train service recovery. For the longer term, we have to increase the resilience of our train network by building another orbital line like the Cross Island Line. This will create multiple interchanges with our existing lines, and provide commuters with more alternative rail routes in the event of any service disruption."
percentage of five- and six-year olds enrolled in pre-schools,"Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what percentage of five- and six-year old Singaporeans and permanent residents are enrolled in half-day or full-day pre-school; and (b) for children who are not enrolled in pre-school, what actions are taken on the parents or guardians and what are the reasons given for not enrolling their children in pre-school.","Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: In 2015, over 90% of Singaporean and permanent resident children aged five to six years were enrolled in half-day or full-day pre-schools.Some Singaporean and permanent resident children may not attend pre-school due to their family's circumstances. For example, there are those who are living overseas, or whose parents prefer other options for their child's development. By age six, close to 99% of Singaporean children would have had some pre-school experience.We recognise the importance of the pre-school years in a child's development, particularly for children from disadvantaged backgrounds. As such, ECDA works actively with the community to reach out to Singaporean children who are not attending pre-school by age five. Our community outreach partners conduct home visits and work closely with the family to overcome some of the barriers to the child's pre-school participation.KidSTART, a new initiative announced at Budget this year, will further enhance efforts to reach out to and ensure children from low income and vulnerable families have early access to appropriate health, learning and developmental support, including attending quality pre-school. We will pilot KidSTART in the second half of 2016."
cases filed since enactment of protection from harassment act,"Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Minister for Law since the coming into force of the Protection from Harassment Act until 31 May 2016, what has been (i) the total number of cases filed, mediated and resolved (ii) the total number of cases involving workplace bullying/harassment (iii) the total number of cases involving sexual harassment and (iv) the total number of cases involving workplace sexual harassment.","Mr K Shanmugam: The Protection from Harassment Act ('the Act"") was introduced to strengthen harassment laws and provide a range of criminal sanctions, civil and self-help remedies to better protect people from harassment and related anti-social behaviour. Cases filed under the Act are managed with a view to assist parties to explore ways to resolve the issues effectively and promptly without proceeding to trial, including the use of counselling and mediation.The Act took effect on 15 November 2014. According to the State Courts, as at 30 April 2016, 203 applications for Protection Orders have been filed. This includes applications by victims of sexual and workplace harassment. However, the State Courts does not track the specific number of cases for each type of case.Of the 203 applications filed, 32 cases were sent to the State Courts Centre for Dispute Resolution for mediation as at 30 April 2016. 63 Protection Orders and 55 Expedited Protection Orders have been granted. 73 applications were withdrawn. Out of the 63 Protection Orders granted, 38 were granted by consent, constituting more than half of the orders that were granted. This suggests that a good number of cases were resolved amicably. The remaining applications have either been dismissed or struck off, or are pending resolution as at 30 April 2016."
promoting safer workplace culture given spate of worker deaths,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked the Minister for Manpower what are the root causes of the recent cases of workplace injuries and death and whether there are strategic and targeted interventions planned.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: MOM is concerned with the deteriorating Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) situation.In the first half of 2016, there are already 42 fatalities, 12 more compared to the same period last year1. Construction sector remains the top contributor with 18 fatalities. This is an 80% increase from last year, where we had 10 from the construction sector.Our preliminary investigations findings indicate that the fatalities had multiple factors as root causes. Many cases were due to inadequate risk assessments carried out by the companies, lack of planning and coordination, and insufficient safety awareness among the workers. On the whole, it points to an absence of a robust WSH management system in the companies involved.MOM has earlier outlined a four-pronged strategy to take targeted interventions to improve WSH raising awareness, building WSH capability, strengthening enforcement and imposing harsher penalties. Stiffer penalties against errant companies which flout safety regulations were introduced in May. Since then2, 25 extended Stop Work Orders were issued against worksites with rampant unsafe conditions. We have also stepped up our enforcement presence, targeting high-risk sectors undertaking activities with high incidences of work injuries such as work at height, crane operations and formwork structures.This heightened regulatory stance by MOM is complemented with stepped up assistance provided by the WSH Council. The Safety Compliance Assistance Visits Plus (SCAV+) programme was launched in June to help companies identify WSH lapses and improve risk assessment capabilities. This supplements existing WSH capability and culture building efforts, such as the WSH Council's bizSAFE and CultureSAFE programmes. The Council also produced a series of pictograms showing WSH Dos and Don'ts of common work situations. These are being distributed to construction sites and foreign worker dormitories as visual reminders to increase the safety consciousness of our workers.We are heartened that the industry also stepped up efforts to increase WSH awareness. In April, more than 100 project sites in the construction and marine sectors participated in a Safety Time Out to review the safety procedures for their work activities. Last month, over 70 worksites participated in safety awareness activities involving CEOs of the Singapore Contractors Association (SCAL) member companies. This is important to demonstrate leadership commitment to WSH. SCAL also collaborated with the Real Estate Developers' Association of Singapore (REDAS) and the WSH Council to develop more user-friendly WSH training materials for construction workers.At a structural level, the Design for Safety (DfS) Regulations will come into effect on 1 August 2016. Under the Regulations, developers and designers will have responsibility for the safety and health of workers in the construction sector. The Regulations will foster greater industry ownership and facilitate information sharing among all stakeholders to improve the identification and management of WSH risks throughout all phases of the building project.It is important to reiterate that WSH is ultimately everyone's responsibility. All stakeholders – employers, supervisors and workers – must take proactive ownership in WSH in order to improve our situation. MOM will continue to work closely with the WSH Council and industry partners to raise WSH standards and foster safe work habits."
difference between workmen and non-workmen in employment act,"Ms K Thanaletchimi asked the Minister for Manpower (a) if he can explain the need for a difference between workmen and non-workmen in the Employment Act in view of the future employment landscape; and (b) whether PMETs earning less than $4,500 who spend more than 50% of their time doing manual tasks can be regarded as workmen.","Mr Lim Swee Say: The distinction between ""workmen"" and ""non-workmen"" in the Employment Act is a legacy issue. ""Workmen"" refers to blue-collar workers who operate machinery and vehicles or are involved in manual labour, such as cleaners, construction workers and labourers. ""Non-workmen"" refers to white-collar workers who are not in managerial or executive positions, such as clerks and receptionists.The Employment Act draws this distinction primarily for Part IV of the Act, which relates to hours of work, rest days and annual leave. This is to take into account the differences in the nature of work between workmen and non-workmen. Our longer term intent is to remove this demarcation given the changing nature of our workforce.For example, we have already taken steps to reduce the difference in coverage between these two groups. In the 2014 amendments to the Employment Act, we raised the salary threshold of non-workmen for Part IV coverage from $2,000 to $2,500 while holding the salary threshold of workmen constant at $4,500. This is to allow the salary threshold of non-workmen to catch up gradually with workmen, while balancing employers’ concerns about rise in business costs.Whether a worker is classified as a workman, a non-workman or a manager or executive depends on the specific nature of his work. The Employment Act clarifies that a worker with supervisory duties who actually does manual work for more than 50% of the time is considered a workman. However, this does not apply to any person who is employed in a managerial or executive position as specified in the Employment Act. The work-hour related provisions in Part IV of the Employment Act are less relevant to managers and executives whose jobs are often more outcomes based.That said, managers and executives enjoy protections under other parts of the Employment Act. In fact, we have progressively enhanced protections for managers and executives in our employment laws over the years. For example, we amended the Employment Act in 2008 to extend salary protection to managers and executives earning less than $2,500 a month, including access to the Labour Court to resolve salary-related disputes. This salary ceiling was raised to $4,500 in 2011 to cover a bigger group of managers and executives. In 2014, we again amended the Employment Act to cover managers and executives for non-salary issues such as sick leave benefits and protection against unfair dismissal. We have also amended our Industrial Relations Act to allow managers and executives more options for union representation at the workplace, most recently in 2015.In addition, MOM is now working with the State Courts to set up the Employment Claims Tribunal (ECT) early next year. The ECT will allow all managers and executives who now have no access to the Labour Court with a new, quick and expeditious channel to resolve statutory and contractual salary-related disputes, subject to certain claims limits.Managers and executives form an important and growing part of our workforce. MOM, together with our tripartite partners, will continue to regularly review our employment laws to ensure that they are adequately protected."
clarification of alleged cooling-off day violations,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Prime Minister with regard to the Elections Department's filing of police reports against two individuals for alleged violations of Cooling-Off Day regulations for the Bukit Batok by-election (a) what constitutes ""regular propagation, promotion and discussion of political issues"" as stated in its press statement; and (b) at which point is such individual propagation no longer within the exception of ""transmitting personal political views on a non-commercial basis using the Internet"".","Mr Chan Chun Sing (for the Prime Minister): Let me state upfront that I cannot comment on individual cases because Police investigations are still ongoing. However, I will speak broadly about election advertising, and how we determine whether specific postings during Cooling-Off Day and Polling Day are allowed or not.Election advertising is defined as any material, whether online or offline, that is intended to raise the standing of, or secure the electoral success of, any candidate or party. Under the Parliamentary Elections Act, election advertising is not allowed on Cooling-Off Day and Polling Day. This is to allow voters time to step back from the excitement and emotion of the campaign, and reflect on the issues at stake before casting their votes.This prohibition applies to all individuals and organisations. However, in the online space, social media has made every individual a potential broadcaster. It is therefore not possible for the Elections Department to monitor every single post in enforcing the prohibition against election advertising on Cooling-Off and Polling days. Instead, the Elections Department takes a practical approach, by taking into account the following factorsa. Intent. Posts clearly intending to promote or procure electoral success of a political party or candidate, or enhance their standing, are not allowed. For example, a post that asks people to ""vote Party A"" is quite clearly intended to secure the electoral success of Party A. A post that portrays ""Party B"" negatively is also considered election advertising as it is likely to enhance the standing of Party A. In addition, repeated publication of posts on Cooling-Off Day and Polling Day, or posts published after ELD had issued its reminder, will be treated more seriously.b. Reach and impact. ELD will consider how many people are likely to have read particular posts. Posts by individuals or groups that regularly engage in the discussion of political issues will have further reach and greater impact than those by ordinary members of the public.As for the Member's second question, the law does allow for individual-to-individual transmission of personal political views, on a non-commercial basis, on Cooling-Off Day and Polling Day. So if a person sends an email or SMS to a friend to share his personal political views about the election, that will not be considered a breach. However, if he blogs or posts a message on his Facebook page that everyone can read, asking readers to vote for a particular party or candidate, that is clearly publication of election advertising."
impact of singapore-kuala lumpur high-speed rail on jurong east region,Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for National Development how the development of the Singapore-Kuala Lumpur high speed rail will impact the Jurong East region and neighbouring estates.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The siting of the High Speed Rail (HSR) terminus in Jurong East dovetails with the Government's vision to develop Jurong Lake District as a second Central Business District and as a new gateway to Singapore.The area around the planned HSR site is more than 100 hectares in size. I chair the Jurong Lake District Steering Committee to oversee the development of this new area, and we have discussed several broad themes in the development plans. First, we should take advantage of its proximity to the Jurong Lake Gardens, which is itself undergoing a major upgrade, to make this a sustainable district distinguished by beautiful greenery and water.Beyond the business and commercial provisions, the area will also be an attractive leisure destination, anchored by the revamped Jurong Lake Gardens and the new Science Centre.Second, the area should be well-integrated with the Jurong Gateway, which is already shaping up well as a vibrant precinct, with a mix of office, retail, residential and other complementary uses. The developments in Jurong Gateway are presently connected by pedestrian links to one another, and also to the Jurong East MRT station. These linkages will be extended seamlessly to the HSR site, which is located just south of the Jurong Gateway.Third, there needs to be an extensive transport network to ensure that residents and visitors can travel in and out of the Jurong East region smoothly. We are mindful of the existing traffic congestion issues in the area, and the Government agencies are studying ways to improve the traffic flows. In particular, we will provide for convenient access between the HSR terminus and the nearby MRT stations – this includes the existing MRT station and the upcoming integrated transport hub in Jurong East, as well as the new stations being planned for the Jurong Region Line and Cross Island Line. We will also plan ahead for infrastructure to accommodate new forms of transport such as autonomous vehicles.The Urban Redevelopment Authority will be launching a Request for Proposal today (11 July 2016) to invite experts to draw up the concept plans for the area. We will also be engaging the public, especially residents in Jurong East and the neighbouring estates, to gather feedback and suggestions."
government's engagement of ride-sharing app companies and private car hire drivers,"Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for Transport (a) in view of a recently published letter by Uber Singapore on the over-regulated approach taken by the Ministry on private car hire companies, whether there has been adequate dialogue with these companies during the Ministry's engagement with stakeholders on the recently announced 'light touch' regulations for ride-sharing app companies and private car hire drivers; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider exempting taxi operators from the Quality of Service, Taxi Availability and other compliance licensing requirements.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: LTA had engaged all the stakeholders in the recent review of the chauffeured services industry. Numerous consultations were held with Uber, Grab, the National Taxi Association, the National Private Hire Vehicle Association, car rental and limousine companies, and most importantly, commuters. While we need some regulations to protect commuters’ interests and safety, we have strived to ensure that these are not so onerous that they stifle innovation of new services and business models.As for taxi operators, the current Taxi Availability and Quality of Service standards ensure that commuters can enjoy a minimum service quality for street hail and phone booking respectively. We have retained them as these remain the primary modes of hiring a taxi, and the current outcomes are satisfactory. Since the Taxi Availability standards were introduced, the proportion of two-shift taxis has increased from 53% to 68%. The proportion of the taxi fleet plying the roads during peak hours has gone up, from 82% to 92%. This has made it easier for commuters to get a taxi by street hail. Nonetheless, the industry is evolving and we will continue to review these requirements to ensure that they remain relevant."
segregating coe bidding for different categories of car buyers,Mr Zaqy Mohamad asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether LTA will consider limiting the categories that private hire cars and taxi companies can bid for COEs as against individual car owners; (b) whether LTA will consider segregating COE bidding between individual owners and companies including car dealers on behalf of individual buyers; and (c) whether LTA has studied the impact of separating COE pricing from new car purchases.,"38 Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry will take out private hire car firms like Uber and Grab Taxi from the COE bidding process and treat them similar to taxi operators so that the COE system is not distorted by their bids for COEs.Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Today, taxi operators do not bid at COE auctions. They draw their COEs from CAT E and pay the CAT A Prevailing Quota Premium. In this way, the impact of the growth and replacement of the taxi fleet, which can be lumpy, is isolated to CAT E.As for the private hire car sector, we will continue to monitor its rate of growth and uptake of COEs, to see if a similar measure will be appropriate.There is nothing that prevents individuals from bidding for COEs on their own. However, most choose to have dealers bid on their behalf, for convenience and also because of the way some dealers package the prices of the cars. We have no plans to segregate individual and proxy bids since ultimately, both emanate from the same demand. Segregating them will be artificial and give a distortionary picture.Buying a car is a transaction between a willing seller and a willing buyer. Most car dealers will offer prices without COEs if asked. It is best that we leave it to the market to decide how car sales should be carried out, whether with the COEs packaged or not."
free replacement of identity cards for selective cases,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether ICA can provide free replacement of NRICs at selected intervals of one's lifetime due to fair wear and tear of our identity cards and outdated photographs.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The Identity Card (IC) is made of a highly durable polycarbonate material that has been subjected to stringent tests to ensure its durability. It is not easily damaged with normal handling. Apart from a small number of cards that may be damaged due to excessive wear and tear over time, there is no need to replace all ICs at regular intervals.The $60 fee for replacing a damaged IC is to cover the production cost, which includes manpower, material, as well as other costs incurred in producing a new card. This fee has remained the same for many years.ICA will consider a waiver of the fee for cases which warrant special consideration. This includes situations where the card was damaged due to circumstances beyond the cardholder's control, such as accidents or fire.Singapore residents are currently required to register for an NRIC at age 15 and to re-register at age 30 with an updated photograph. Given longer life expectancy, ICA is studying the feasibility of introducing a second NRIC re-registration at an older age."
inclusion of saf camps in smoking ban,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan asked the Minister for Defence (a) what is the impact of the inclusion of SAF camps in the list of places where smoking is prohibited by law on service personnel who continue to smoke; and (b) whether there is engagement of all ranks of smoking or non-smoking personnel to ensure that they understand the reasons for the ban and to obtain their support in maintaining it.,"Dr Ng Eng Hen: The ban on smoking within SAF camps and bases is not new. In fact, even before the Smoking Prohibition Act, SAF has since 1993 administratively restricted smoking for its servicemen to designated smoking points, known as ""Yellow Boxes"", which are situated away from main thoroughfares and walkways. This prohibition was enforced with errant offenders punished accordingly.The recent inclusion of SAF camps and bases under the Smoking (Prohibition in Certain Places) Act formalised an existing and long-standing administrative restriction under national law. The only change with this inclusion is that the SAF can now also provide particulars of civilians who violate the smoking prohibitions in our camps and bases to the National Environment Agency for possible enforcement actions."
no claim discount on medishield life for elderly without claims in three years,"Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry can consider granting a ""No Claim Discount"" on MediShield Life premiums for senior citizens who do not make any claims for a consecutive period of three years.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: The idea of a ""No Claim Discount"" on MediShield Life premiums was considered by the MediShield Life Review Committee when they conducted their review in 2014. After careful deliberation, the Committee decided against the idea.The Committee felt that having a ""No Claim Discount"" may lead Singaporeans to delay seeking essential treatment even though they are ill. This may result in worse outcomes such as medical complications, prolonged illness and even larger hospital bills down the road.Furthermore, a person could take good care of his health, and still require medical treatment. For example, he may encounter an accident. Introducing a ""No Claim Discount"" may unduly ""penalise"" such individuals who are hospitalised for reasons beyond their control."
investigation into engine fire on sq368,Mr Yee Chia Hsing asked the Minister for Transport if he can provide an update on the investigation into the cause of the engine fire on SQ368 on 27 June 2016 including whether pre-flight checks have been conducted properly and what is being done to ensure that a similar incident does not happen again.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: We are taking the incident on 27 June 2016 involving SQ368 very seriously, notwithstanding the fact that there were no casualties and that airport operations returned to normal in a matter of hours.The Air Accident Investigation Bureau of Singapore (AAIB) has already started its investigations into the incident. Its aim is to establish the cause and make recommendations to prevent recurrence.The investigation is being conducted in accordance with protocols set by the International Civil Aviation Organization. The investigation team includes accredited representatives from the US National Transportation Safety Board, and technical advisers from the Federal Aviation Administration, the aircraft manufacturer Boeing and engine manufacturer General Electric. The AAIB investigation covers issues such as aircraft operations, aircraft maintenance, training, the design and manufacture of the aircraft and engine, human factors as well as regulatory oversight.Separately, as the safety regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) is also conducting its own investigations to ensure the continued safety of air travel. Its investigations include reviewing whether the aircraft and engine were well maintained, and whether the flight operations and emergency response were conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements and procedures. CAAS' preliminary findings are that the pre-flight aircraft checks were carried out properly and by qualified personnel.We expect the AAIB investigation to take approximately six months, as the engine and its components will need to be taken apart carefully and examined. It is our intention for the findings of the investigation to be made public. In the meantime, CAAS has worked with Singapore Airlines to ensure that all safety procedures continue to be strictly adhered to on all its flights."
police guidelines for handling complaints of noise and neighbour disputes in condominiums,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling asked the Minister for Home Affairs what are the current guidelines for the police when handling complaints of noise and neighbour disputes within condominiums.,"Mr K Shanmugam: Noise complaints among neighbours, whether in condominiums or other types of housing, are often related to underlying problems such as disputes, inconsiderate behaviour or intolerance. Such problems are best addressed through a community-based approach, where community partners, Government agencies and grassroots leaders work together to settle such disputes.First, we must promote good neighbourliness to prevent disputes from arising, as residents on friendly terms are more likely to be considerate and tolerant of differences. Second, we encourage mediation to mend relationships, where disputing parties find it difficult to resolve issues on their own. Third, we provide options of legal recourse as a last resort. The Community Dispute Resolution Tribunals (CDRTs) were established in 2015 to provide simple and specialised court processes to help neighbours resolve disputes.A Police response should only be considered where there are law and order concerns – for instance, when the noise arises from fights, or large congregations that pose safety and security concerns. In such cases that warrant Police's attention, Police would dispatch frontline resources to maintain law and order."
home protection scheme for all hdb flat owners with outstanding home loans,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development what is the status of the review to make it compulsory for all HDB flat owners servicing their housing loans to take up the Home Protection Scheme (HPS).,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Currently, it is mandatory for HDB flat owners who use CPF monies to service their loans to take up the Home Protection Scheme (HPS) or similar mortgage insurance. 6 in 10 of all HDB flat owners with outstanding loans belong to this category.Among the remaining 4 in 10 HDB flat owners who do not use CPF to service their loans, 43% of them have already opted for HPS voluntarily. There may also be others who have taken up mortgage insurance from the private sector.We recognise the importance of mortgage insurance, as it ensures that surviving family members are protected in the event of death, terminal illness or total permanent disability of the flat owner before the housing loans are paid up. MND and MOM are therefore reviewing the extension of mandatory HPS or similar insurance to HDB flat owners who do not use CPF monies to service their housing loans.As part of this review, we are studying factors such as the affordability of premiums and measures to minimise lapses in paying for the premiums, before making a decision on this matter."
making traffic lights crossing at junctions safer for pedestrians,"Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked the Minister for Transport with regard to T or X-junctions where vehicles are allowed to turn right when the traffic light is green while pedestrians are crossing (a) how many injuries and fatalities have occurred at these junctions in the last five years; and (b) where there are green arrows at such junctions, on average, how long do they remain on green and approximately how many cars are allowed to turn.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: There are 1,451 signalised T- and X-junctions where motorists are allowed to turn right while pedestrians are crossing. From 2011 to 2015, there were a total of 14 fatalities and 319 injuries which involved pedestrians and cyclists being hit by right-turning vehicles at such junctions.To enhance the safety of our junctions, LTA is installing more measures such as traffic light timings that give pedestrians a head-start in crossing the road and additional road markings and signs to alert right-turning vehicles to the presence of pedestrians crossing the road.At most signalised junctions where vehicles are allowed to turn right when pedestrians are crossing, the right turn green arrow is on for between 5 and 12 seconds, which allows about three to six vehicles per lane to turn right."
take-up rate for 2-room hdb flats,Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for National Development as of June 2016 (a) what is the number of 2-room HDB flats including studio apartments that have been built and left unsold; (b) what is the percentage of 2-room flats on 99-year lease versus flexi-lease that have been sold; and (c) what is the number of flexi-lease 2-room flats including studio apartment that have been returned to HDB and what are the main reasons for such returns.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: As of June 2016, there are about 2,200 2-room Flexi flats, including studio apartments (SAs), which are unsold. About 40% of these are completed while 60% are still under construction. These flats make up about 7% of the total number of 2-room Flexi flats and SAs that HDB has offered. About 60% of these units have been offered in the last two Sale of Balance Flats exercises and are pending selection.Since HDB introduced 2-room Flexi flats in the November 2015 sales exercise, 70% of the units were bought on 99-year leases while 30% were bought on short leases.As of June 2016, no 2-room Flexi flat bought on short leases has been returned to HDB, while about 540 SAs have been returned to HDB. The main reasons for these returns were demise of the owner or the owners moving to stay with their family."
provision of vehicle's certificate of insurance to drivers of private hire cars,Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry will consider requiring private hire car leasing companies to provide their drivers each with a certified original copy of the vehicle's Certificate of Insurance to ensure that drivers are fully aware of their own accident excess liabilities and other vehicle-related risks.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: It is the drivers' responsibility to ensure that they apprise themselves fully of the car's insurance coverage, liabilities and other terms and conditions, before entering into an agreement with the car leasing company. We will also bring their attention to it by including it in the curriculum for the Private Hire Car Driver Vocational Licence."
payment of cpf contributions and workfare income supplement to prison inmates and disabled adults,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Ministry mandates the payment of CPF contributions and Workfare Income Supplement to (i) prison inmates who undergo in-prison training to get them ready for work as well as those who undergo work programmes in prison; and (ii) disabled adults at organisations like the Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore who do work for social enterprise programmes.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: In general, all Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents are required to make CPF contributions if they earn an income from two categories of work in Singapore.i. The first category refers to those who are working under Contracts of Service, where there is an employee-employer relationship, and who earn more than $50 per month.ii. The second category refers to those who are Self-Employed Persons and whose net trade income is more than $6,000 per year.CPF contributions are mandated for persons with disabilities who do work for social enterprise programmes if the work arrangements fall under the two categories above. For example, the centres run by the Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore (MINDS) currently enable the training of persons with disabilities in social enterprises. There is no employer-employee relationship between MINDS and the person with disabilities. CPF contributions are not required to be made by or on behalf of these persons with disabilities.Work programmes in prison are part of the overall inmate rehabilitation programme. The work programmes serve to keep the inmates meaningfully occupied during their prison term, and prepare inmates for employment upon their release. Participation in such work programme is voluntary and inmates can ask to cease participation at any time. Prison inmates do not work under a Contract of Service, and there is no employer-employee relationship between the Government and the inmate. CPF contributions are not required to be made by or on behalf of these prison inmates.The Workfare Income Supplement, or WIS, supplements the income and CPF savings of eligible Singaporeans aged 35 and above. This age criterion for WIS is waived for persons with disabilities.Persons with disabilities can qualify for WIS if they make the necessary CPF contributions in line with their work arrangements. Prison inmates who participate in work programmes can likewise qualify for WIS if they make the necessary contributions to their CPF Medisave accounts."
regulations for f&b outlets to display calorie and nutrition information on menus,Mr Zaqy Mohamad asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry will consider regulations for food and beverage outlets to display calorie and nutrition information in their menus as part of its war on diabetes and countering rising obesity.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Evidence from other countries suggests that requiring calorie labels on menus can be effective in reducing the number of calories consumed, if consumers are aware of the labels and understand how to use them. Calorie labels also help to incentivise food and beverage businesses to modify their recipes and offer lower calorie options on their menus.We have made some progress on this front in Singapore. Restaurants such as Dian Xiao Er and The Soup Spoon have shown the calorie values for all their menu items. Food court operators like Kopitiam have also done so at selected outlets. Other operators, such as Foodfare and Koufu, highlight the calorie value of their healthier dishes, while McDonald's and Subway provide calorie information online. There is scope to do more in this area and we will continue to work with the food and beverage industry, to provide Singaporeans with a larger variety of healthier meal options.The Diabetes Prevention and Care Taskforce will study Mr Zaqy Mohamad's proposal in consultation with our stakeholders, including hawkers and small businesses, and look at how we can balance the benefits and associated costs of implementation. I thank the Member for his suggestion."
incentives and grants to help construction companies manage labour costs,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for National Development given the construction sector's heavy reliance on foreign manpower, what are the specific incentives and grants available to help businesses in the construction sector, especially SMEs, to cope with the increase in the foreign worker levy.","Mr Lawrence Wong: To shift the construction industry away from a reliance on foreign manpower, BCA uses a combination of higher foreign worker levy and grants and incentives to encourage the adoption of productive construction methods.Since 2010, close to $800 million of funding has been made available to firms through the Construction Productivity and Capability Fund (CPCF). The CPCF supports firms in the built environment sector in areas of workforce development and technology adoption. To date, $400 million have been committed to fund projects undertaken by more than 8,000 firms, of which 90% are small and medium-sized firms.The Workforce Training and Upgrading Scheme, funded through the CPCF, provides up to 90% funding support for firms to upgrade their local employees. Firms can also receive up to 80% funding support to train and upgrade their Basic Skilled R2 workers, to Higher Skilled R1 workers. In addition, there is a suite of scholarship and sponsorship programmes to help firms attract and develop their local workforce.Besides worker training, companies can also receive funding support to mechanise their operations, and adopt productive technologies and processes.We encourage the industry to continue tapping on the incentives and grants available to improve construction productivity."
impact of starting train operations later on sundays on workers,Ms K Thanaletchimi asked the Minister for Transport with the delayed commencement of MRT trains affecting 13 train stations on Sundays with effect from June (a) how many commuters especially workers will be affected; (b) whether more bus services will ply along the train route with minimum inconvenience to workers commencing work at 7 am or earlier; and (c) whether the Ministry will work with the affected sectors such as the hospitals to assist healthcare workers commuting via public transport and who commence work at 7 am.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The temporary change in operating hours on Sunday mornings may affect about 13,000 passengers. I would like to thank the affected commuters for their understanding and patience. The additional hour per week will allow the train maintenance staff to speed up the on-going track renewal works.LTA has assessed that there are adequate bus services plying the affected stretch. Nonetheless, we will be adding an interim bus service, with a frequency of 10 minutes, running between Bukit Gombak and Joo Koon via Jurong East. We will monitor the situation closely and adjust our measures to mitigate the impact on commuters."
extension of free mrt travel to ease peak-hour travel,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the free travel to CBD MRT stations will be extended in its coming review; (b) how many commuters have benefitted from this scheme since it was launched; (c) what is the percentage of improvement it has contributed to peak-hour travel; and (d) whether the scheme can be extended to more stations in non-CBD areas serving the industrial and business parks.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: We recently announced that the Free Pre-peak Travel scheme will be extended to June 2017. Around 65,000 commuters benefit from the scheme daily. The number of morning peak hour exits at the designated city centre stations has fallen by about 7%, with the ratio of peak to pre-peak exits falling from 2.7 to 2.1.The Free Pre-peak Travel scheme is aimed at reducing crowding along the most congested stretches of our rail network during the morning peak period, which are primarily city-bound trips. We started the Travel Smart Rewards Programme to complement the Free Pre-peak Travel scheme. Under Travel Smart, commuters travelling to MRT stations outside the city area can earn credits for travelling outside peak periods. For commuters who consistently travel off-peak, the Off-Peak Monthly Travel Passes offer further discounts over the regular monthly travel passes."
automatic pr status for foreign spouses of singapore citizens with one singapore citizen child,Ms Tin Pei Ling asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether foreign spouses of Singapore citizens and who have at least one Singapore citizen child together can be granted permanent residence automatically after a specified period of time so that the Singaporean family can be complete and stable.,"Mr K Shanmugam: Permanent Residence (PR) is not automatically granted to foreigners who are married to Singaporean Citizens (SCs). Each PR application is evaluated holistically on a range of criteria such as the financial ability of the SC spouse to support the foreign spouse. The fact that there are SC children from the marriage would be a plus factor.Foreign spouses who do not qualify for PR yet may be granted a Long-Term Visit Pass (LTVP) or Long Term Visit Pass-Plus (LTVP+) for them to remain in Singapore with their families. Those who are granted LTVP and LTVP+ are allowed to seek employment to help support their families.In 2015, ICA implemented the Pre-Marriage LTVP Assessment (PMLA). The PMLA provides greater clarity, prior to marriage, on whether the foreign spouse can qualify for long term stay in Singapore. It helps prospective Singaporean-foreigner couples better plan for the future. Prospective Singaporean-foreigner couples are strongly encouraged to undergo the PMLA before marriage."
cycling for students,Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Acting Minister for Education (Schools) (a) whether the Ministry will offer cycling lessons among its list of activities for students in primary and secondary schools; and (b) whether there is any survey done to find out what percentage of our students cycle to schools.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: MOE’s primary focus on cycling is on safety. As part of the Physical Education curriculum in primary schools, students learn about personal safety and safety of others as a cyclist, as well as a pedestrian. This is taught in Primary 3. In addition, MOE is collaborating with Land Transport Authority to offer a cycling safety enrichment programme to students in Secondary Schools who are able to cycle. This would be a voluntary programme where students would be taught safe cycling practices. We currently have no specific plans to offer cycling lessons in our schools beyond this cycling safety enrichment programme.MOE has not carried out any survey on the number of students who cycle to school. From schools' observations, this number is small. Nevertheless, MOE will continue to work with partner agencies such as Land Transport Authority and Traffic Police to improve road safety infrastructure around schools to keep our students and other road users safe, including students who cycle to school. MOE will also continue to monitor the traffic situation and design programmes to promote student safety."
making overhead pedestrian bridges elder- and disabled-friendly,"Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for Transport (a) to date, what is the number of overhead bridges that have lifts; and (b) what are the alternative solutions to make overhead bridges, especially those found in mature estates, elderly and handicap friendly if lifts and ramps cannot be installed for some reason.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Today, 33 pedestrian overhead bridges have lifts. LTA is installing lifts at 34 more bridges by 2018, and 50 more bridges after that. We will then review the situation for the subsequent phases. We will prioritise bridges near places such as transport hubs, hospitals, polyclinics, welfare homes, homes for the aged, and schools for children with special needs.For bridges that are regularly used by the elderly and physically disabled, if it is impossible to install lifts because of location constraints, we will explore alternatives like street-level crossings."
enforcement actions against cluttering of common space at hdb flats and estates,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked the Minister for National Development whether there are national level plans to take enforcement action on the cluttering issue in common spaces of HDB flats and housing estates.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Town Councils manage and maintain common areas in HDB estates. They enforce by-laws that regulate the use of the common property, including the placing of objects at common areas. These by-laws are typically guided by Singapore Civil Defence Force's guidelines on fire safety.HDB as well as many Town Councils also carry out public education to remind residents about the risk posed by clutter in common areas.At the same time, residents can play their part by keeping the common areas clean and free from clutter, to ensure a safe living environment for all."
cost of developing new generation erp system,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Transport (a) why is the cost of developing the new generation ERP that is based on the Global Navigation Satellite System estimated to cost $556 million; (b) what are the reasons for the huge difference in the price quoted by the winning tenderer compared to the next highest quote of $1.2 billion; and (c) what will be the Ministry's approach on how data collected will be anonymised and aggregated to protect individual's privacy.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The tender awarded for the next generation ERP system includes the cost of designing and building the backend computer system, operating and maintaining the system for the first five years, replacement of On-Board Units (OBUs) for vehicles, and additional equipment like cameras and roadside beacons. It also includes the cost of providing other value-added functions such as capabilities for collection and dissemination of traffic information, and electronic payment for roadside parking, checkpoint tolls and usage of off-peak cars.Both tender bids received were of good technical quality. The difference in tender prices was due to differences in the tenderers’ cost estimates and pricing strategies.Safeguarding motorists’ privacy was a key requisite in the tender. The system must be able to anonymise and aggregate ERP data for traffic management and analysis."
carbon filters for food exhaust systems at hawker centres,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) how many NEA hawker centres currently have activated carbon filters installed in the exhaust systems; (b) whether there are plans to install such filters for existing hawker centres that do not have them; and (c) what other measures is NEA taking to ensure better odour control, smoke, noise and grease reduction in hawker centres in residential areas.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Prior to the commencement of the Hawker Centres Upgrading Programme (HUP) in 2001, hawker centres were not fitted with centralised exhaust systems. Centralised exhaust systems were introduced during the HUP. These systems are typically fitted with baffle filters to reduce the grease in cooking fumes.For new centres, besides a centralised exhaust system with baffle filters, NEA also considers the installation of additional air cleaning systems such as carbon filters, ultraviolet lamps or electrostatic precipitators in their exhaust systems to prevent grease or odour issues.Currently, four hawker centres have additional air cleaning systems such as carbon filters installed in their exhaust systems. If there are issues related to the exhaust system of specific hawker centres, NEA will look into the feedback and work with the relevant stakeholders, including Town Councils for HDB centres, to explore appropriate solutions for the centres such as replacing the motors in the exhaust system or installing carbon filters in the exhaust system, if necessary."
coverage of approved items for claim under seniors' mobility and enabling fund,"Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Minister for Health whether the Seniors' Mobility And Enabling Fund can be used to fund the cost of battery replacement, and maintenance and repair of the mobility devices provided by the Fund.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Seniors’ Mobility & Enabling Fund (SMF) provides means-tested subsidies to offset the cost of assistive devices, home healthcare items and transport services to MOH-funded eldercare and dialysis centres. It supports caregivers in caring for seniors at home.Over 29,000 seniors have benefited from SMF since its establishment in 2011. Of these, about 15,800 seniors received subsidies for mobility devices such as wheelchairs, motorised wheelchairs and walking aids.The demand for devices and transport services for seniors is growing. We have therefore prioritised our funding to target the purchase of essential mobility equipment, rather than maintenance and repair, including battery replacement. Nonetheless, we have provided, on a case-by-case basis, SMF subsidy to some seniors with a critical need for the device but no financial means to replace a battery or repair the device.We will continue to review the scope of the SMF as needs of seniors evolve, within the fiscal resources available for this scheme."
fencing up of open fields in hdb estates,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth with regard to open fields in HDB estates that are fenced up and managed by the People's Association such as the large field behind Punggol Community Club (a) whether these decisions to fence up the fields have been made in consultation with residents; (b) what are their utilisation rates on weekdays compared to on weekends; and (c) whether the fields can be opened up during weekdays and off-peak periods for families to enjoy without the need for booking.","Mr Chan Chun Sing (for the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth): Open fields are managed by various Government agencies and statutory bodies, including the People’s Association (PA). For fields managed by PA, their primary purpose is for community use.The local residents will work with the GROs to determine if there is any need to fence up a field. The usual considerations are safety of use, security, noise management and maintenance. For example, the said field in Punggol was fenced up upon residents’ request for safety and noise management considerations.Utilisation rates vary and depend on various factors. They are generally higher during weekends and school holidays.All local residents are welcome to use the fields for community activities and can make a simple booking with the local GROs."
acquittal of female offender of sexual assault charges,"Mr Alex Yam asked the Minister for Home Affairs in light of a recent High Court judgment which acquitted a female offender of sexual assault charges, whether the Ministry will consider amending section 376A(1)(b) and other non-gender neutral sections of the Penal Code.",26 Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether the Ministry will amend the law so that sexual penetration will apply to female offenders; and (b) whether the Ministry will review all laws on sexual offences to make them gender-neutral.Mr K Shanmugam: The Prosecution has filed an appeal against the High Court’s decision in the recent case of Public Prosecutor v Zunika Binte Ahmad.MHA will await the outcome of the appeal before considering our next steps.
helmets and insurance for users of personal mobility devices,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry will consider making it mandatory for users of personal mobility devices to (i) put on safety helmets and (ii) have insurance coverage for at least third-party claims.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: We have studied the practices of countries that have longer histories of facilitating the use of bicycles and personal mobility devices (PMDs). As PMDs are generally safe, most of these countries do not mandate helmets and insurance for cyclists or PMD users. In our case, PMDs are not allowed on roads and have to abide by speed limits of 15km/h on footpaths and 25km/h on shared and cycling paths. These rules provide further safeguards to pedestrians. We are aware that some cyclists and PMDs voluntarily wear helmets or buy insurance as added precaution. For now, we have decided not to impose additional costs on everyone by making helmets and insurance compulsory. Let us monitor the situation and keep an open mind on whether a change is warranted in future.At the same time, we need to educate users and enforce against those who flout the rules. Cyclists and PMD users have to be very mindful of the safety of pedestrians. They should always give way to pedestrians, including children and the frail. This is our consistent message to them - be considerate and gracious, give way to pedestrians for your own safety and that of other path users."
update on development of singapore-kuala lumpur high-speed rail,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Transport if he will provide an update on the latest development on the Singapore-Kuala Lumpur high-speed rail (HSR) train and the extension of Singapore's MRT line to Johor Bahru.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: There is good progress on the High Speed Rail project. The two Governments have conducted a joint market sensing exercise to gauge market interest and gather feedback on the commercial aspects of the project. We received very good responses. Both countries are now using the feedback to further develop the project’s commercial model and procurement approach. We are also concurrently discussing the security, regulatory and technical aspects.The Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System (RTS) Link is also making steady progress. Following Malaysia’s confirmation that their station will be located at Bukit Chagar in August 2015, Phase 2 of the Joint Engineering Study has commenced. This will take around 18 months. At the same time, the two Governments have also begun discussing the commercial, regulatory and security aspects of the project."
schedule for repainting of hdb multi-storey car park buildings,"Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the repainting schedule for HDB multi-storey car park buildings; and (b) whether the repainting of the car park building is scheduled to coincide with the repainting of flats in the same precinct and, if not, what are the reasons.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Currently, Town Councils (TCs) manage the general Repair & Re-decoration (R&R) works, including repainting, for the residential blocks in their respective towns. HDB manages the R&R works for all HDB Multi-Storey Car Parks (MSCPs), and generally adopts a seven-year cycle for such works.It is a good idea to coordinate the R&R works for the MSCPs and residential blocks, and HDB will be happy to work out suitable arrangements with the TCs. In particular, HDB can engage the TCs to undertake the R&R works for MSCPs on its behalf, with funding provided to the TCs for this purpose. This will enable TCs to better synchronise the R&R works in their towns, achieve a more coordinated look for the precinct, and minimise inconvenience to residents. Some TCs have already taken up this arrangement, and HDB welcomes more to do so."
installing additional road safety features,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Transport (a) what are the criteria used to determine whether additional road safety tools such as speed bumps, regulating road strips or raised zebra crossings should be implemented; (b) what are the initiatives taken by the Ministry to promote traffic safety in private estates; and (c) what mechanism is used to regularly measure whether those initiatives have been effective.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: LTA implements additional road safety measures at locations with high accident risk or where motorists tend to speed. We compare accident rates and vehicular speeds before and after implementation of the measures to assess their effectiveness.LTA and Traffic Police work together with the community to promote road safety in both private and public estates. For example, LTA recently implemented advance ""STOP"" markings at Gerald Estate, along Yio Chu Kang Road, after receiving feedback from the community about motorists not stopping at stop lines."
update on community health assist scheme's inclusion of gp clinics and dental clinics,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked the Minister for Health if he can provide an update on the review of the Community Health Assist Scheme to include all GP clinics and dental clinics.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Currently, with 900 CHAS GP and 650 CHAS dental clinics island-wide, Singaporeans enjoy good access to subsidies at CHAS clinics. On average, each constituency has around 30 GP and 20 dental clinics under CHAS. Over 96% of CHAS cardholders and Pioneers have a CHAS clinic within 15 minutes by public transport from their homes.Since the introduction of CHAS in 2012, the number of clinics participating in CHAS has increased significantly. Today, 70% of our primary care GP clinics are already participating in CHAS. We will continue with our targeted engagement efforts to bring on board more GP and dental clinics to participate in CHAS and to play a bigger role in providing appropriate and affordable primary care to our residents."
coe quota and pricing policy for taxi hirers,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry will review the COE quota and pricing policy for taxi hirers in view of the increasing demand from new competitors in the market and the introduction of new regulations for these new competitors.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: In August 2012, taxis were taken out of the COE bidding process. Taxi operators are allowed to pay the CAT A Prevailing Quota Premium for their COEs, regardless of the model of taxi being registered, in recognition of their public transport role. The Taxi Availability standards were also introduced, and taxi operators can grow their fleets by up to 2% per annum, subject to them meeting the standards. Since the introduction of the standards, more taxis are plying the roads to serve commuters especially during peak hours, and the taxis are being more efficiently utilised. We will not be removing this COE concession for taxis nor the cap on taxi fleet growth for now. We will continue to regularly review the issue."
insurance coverage for private car hire,Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for Transport whether passengers using Uber taxi services or Grab taxi services are covered by insurance in the event of any accident.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The Motor Vehicles Act requires all motor vehicles, including taxis and private hire cars, to be insured against third-party liability risks, which include death or bodily injury to passengers. Specifically, this means that passengers in a taxi that was booked through UberTaxi or GrabTaxi and which is involved in a motor accident, can claim compensation from the owner of the taxi or its insurer."
reviewing coe growth rate per year,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry will review the present COE growth rate per year.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The allowable Vehicle Growth Rate is currently 0.25% per year, effective until January 2018. We will review this again in 2017 with a view to reducing it to zero eventually."
promoting interest among singapore students for engineering studies,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (a) what is the Ministry doing to (i) cope with the demand for more engineers and (ii) get more students interested in taking up engineering in our universities and polytechnics; and (b) how many students will be graduating from our universities with engineering degrees this year.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: Every year, MOE works in close consultation with various economic agencies to ensure that the supply of engineering training places in the Institute of Technical Education, polytechnics and the Autonomous Universities (AUs) is aligned with the demand for manpower by the industry.As the demand for engineers has increased, the number of full-time engineering graduates from our AUs has also risen from about 3,700 graduates in 2012 to 4,400 graduates projected this year.We have initiatives at various levels to interest students to take up engineering as a course of study.In secondary schools, the Applied Learning Programmes (ALP) in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) enable students to apply their knowledge and skills in authentic situations, to address real-world problems and offer opportunities to interact with engineering professionals. More than 50% of our secondary schools offer ALP in STEM areas.We have partnered Science Centre Singapore to set up STEM Inc., a new unit within Science Centre Singapore, to support schools starting ALP in STEM areas. Currently, STEM Inc. supports 64 schools.The polytechnics regularly organise activities and events, such as engineering competitions and seminars, offering education and career guidance. These events raise awareness amongst students of the progression opportunities of a polytechnic education in engineering.At the university level, we have introduced more options for the study of engineering to attract a wider pool of studentsa. For example, we have new degree programmes in Sustainable Infrastructure Engineering and Telematics by the Singapore Institute of Technology, which are targeted at meeting our transport engineering needs.b. In recognition of students’ interest in multi-disciplinary learning opportunities, we have created new programmes, such as the Dual Degree Programme in Technology and Management, jointly offered by the Singapore University of Technology and Design and Singapore Management University.c. To groom top engineering talent, we established the Singapore University of Technology and Design as an engineering- and design-centric research university.d. NUS and NTU have also launched premium engineering programmes such as the Global Engineering Programme and the Renaissance Engineering Programme respectively, attracting the very best students.With greater exposure upstream and a variety of engineering programmes, more students will be able to develop an interest in engineering and pursue it at the tertiary level."
deferment of collection of keys for bto flats,"Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for National Development (a) in the last 12 months, how many Singaporeans who have purchased BTO flats have requested for a deferment of collection of keys; (b) what proportion of such requests have been due to inability to sell their existing flats; and (c) how will the Government assist residents in such situations.","Mr Lawrence Wong: In 2015, about 300 flat buyers requested to defer collection of keys when their BTO flats were ready. Of these, about two-thirds or less than 200 flat buyers did so because they were unable to sell their existing flat. This was less than 1% of the 22,000 buyers who had collected their keys in the same year.BTO flat buyers generally have up to six months after collecting the keys to their BTO flat to sell their existing flats. HDB may exercise flexibility and grant an extension of time for buyers to collect keys to the BTO flat. However, HDB is not able to hold on to the completed flat indefinitely as there are holding costs involved.Buyers who intend to use the sales proceeds from their existing flat to finance the purchase of their BTO flat should aim to finalise the sale before the estimated completion date of their new flat. HDB helps by keeping buyers updated on the likely completion dates of their new flats as the date draws nearer. For those who have submitted a resale application to sell their existing flat and need help with their cash flow situation, HDB will also be prepared to extend a temporary loan, which would be fully redeemed from the sales proceeds of the existing flat when it is eventually sold."
enrolment in junior colleges,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Acting Minister for Education (Schools) (a) what has been the enrolment rate at junior colleges (JCs) over the past three years; (b) whether there are JCs with excess capacity; and (c) what is the building programme for JCs in the next two years.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: The JC enrolment figures are 30,200 in 2014, 28,300 in 2015 and 27,100 in 2016. These figures include both JC1 and JC2 students.We currently have sufficient JC places for all eligible students who apply for a JC place. We also have enough capacity to cope with surge demand due to larger cohort sizes in particular years as well as places for returning Singaporeans. The falling cohort sizes in recent years, which we expect to generally continue to trend down over the next few years, would have implications for our JCs. We are therefore carefully studying the best option for the future JC landscape. Our priority is to ensure that our JCs continue to provide our students with a good range of educational programmes and learning experiences.There are currently no new building plans for JCs in the next two years. Work on Eunoia JC’s (EJC) interim and permanent sites is on track. The decision to establish EJC was made in 2010 when the Integrated Programme (IP) was expanded to benefit more students. EJC was also planned to provide the Year 5 and 6 programmes for the IP students from three feeder secondary schools."
pioneer generation and other subsidies for elderly patients not physically present to collect medications,"Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked the Minister for Health whether there can be exceptions made for Pioneer Generation (PG) patients who are not able to be physically present to collect medications and supplies due to mobility conditions and other factors, to still be able to utilise their PG subsidies and the Medication Assistance Fund.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Mdm Speaker, for Pioneer Generation (PG) patients with mobility restrictions, their care-givers can collect the prescribed medications and supplies on their behalf.The same subsidies will apply whether the PG patient collects the medications and supplies in person or through a care-giver. This includes PG subsidies as well as the Medication Assistance Fund.We will remind our healthcare institutions and staff of this arrangement, so that it is implemented effectively on the ground to benefit our PG patients."
eligibility of tax rebate for electric cars,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Transport (a) what are the criteria to assess whether an electric car is eligible for tax rebates; and (b) how long does it take to process the tax rebate application.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: An electric car is treated no differently from any other car under the Carbon Emissions-based Vehicle Scheme (CEVS). Even though electric cars produce no tailpipe emissions, the process of generating the electricity they consume emits carbon. This has to be taken into consideration when we assess whether to give them a carbon emissions rebate or levy a surcharge. If it is assessed to produce equivalent low CO2 emissions, it is eligible for a rebate off its Additional Registration Fee. If it is assessed to produce high equivalent CO2 emissions, a surcharge is levied.For new cars, its CO2 emissions for the purposes of CEVS are based on requisite test reports from the manufacturers. On the other hand, used cars imported into Singapore will need to undergo testing at accredited vehicle testing centres to determine their CO2 emissions.The rebate or surcharge is applied immediately at the point of registration."
information on specifications of cars manufactured abroad,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Transport (a) how are officers at LTA and the vehicle inspection centres kept abreast of changes in the specifications of cars manufactured abroad; and (b) why are some car exhaust systems not allowed even though these may emit lower noise levels and are well within the decibels allowed.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: All imported vehicles have to be approved by LTA before they can be registered for use. As part of the approval process, the importer has to provide the full specifications of the vehicle model. From this, LTA will know if there is any change in the vehicle specifications.Car exhaust systems must comply with both LTA’s safety regulations and the noise and emissions standards set by the National Environment Agency. Car exhaust systems that meet noise standards but fail emissions or safety standards will not be allowed."
trial of electric vehicle car-sharing programme,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether he can give an update on the outcome of the trial of the Electric Vehicle Car-Sharing Programme; (b) how many private electric cars have been registered in the past two years; and (c) what is the Ministry's position on encouraging car owners to switch to electric cars.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The Land Transport Authority (LTA) and the Economic Development Board had earlier issued a Request for Information (RFI) to invite proposals for an electric vehicle car-sharing programme. The proposals are being evaluated and the result of the RFI will be announced soon.Two private electric cars, a new Peugeot Ion and a used Tesla Model S, were registered in the past two years.We are neutral as to the type of technology cars use. Our position is that we want to encourage environmental-friendliness and minimise emissions."
ensuring quality of works done for home improvement programme,Dr Tan Wu Meng asked the Minister for National Development (a) what are the measures that HDB has put in place to (i) ensure the quality of Home Improvement Programme (HIP) upgrading works; (ii) minimise disamenities to residents undergoing HIP; and (b) what are the penalties imposed on contractors performing substandard HIP work.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The Home Improvement Programme (HIP) seeks to enhance the safety and functionality of our older flats, and help residents to resolve some common maintenance issues that they may face within their flat, such as ceiling leaks or spalling concrete.HDB adopts a multi-pronged approach to ensure the quality of HIP upgrading works. First, HDB has a stringent procurement process to engage capable and financially-sound contractors and consultants. Second, HDB maintains a list of recommended building materials suppliers for contractors to use in HIP projects. Third, HDB requires contractors to provide sample units before mass production. Once these sample units are approved, they serve as the quality benchmark. Fourth, HDB engages consultants with full-time staff on site to supervise upgrading works. Fifth, HDB institutes a robust quality audit and enforcement regime. Sixth, HDB has regular dialogue sessions with the contractors’ senior management to share the expected quality and workmanship standards and alert them of the quality issues that require their remedial action and pre-emptive measures. Seventh, HDB and consultants carry out functional tests to check on electrical services installed and the water-tightness of the upgraded toilets. Finally, HDB and consultants conduct a final inspection on completed upgrading works prior to the handover to residents.Residents do not need to move out of their flats when HIP is underway. Understandably, there will be some inconveniences when the works are in progress. HDB seeks to keep these to a minimum, and to complete work on the interior of each flat within 10 working days. When work is in progress, temporary common toilets/bathrooms are provided at the void deck. Portable toilets are also set up at the end of each working day in flats undergoing upgrading works, for residents’ use at night. In addition, an air-conditioned study room and rest area are provided for residents’ use. Residents can also provide feedback, make enquiries and seek assistance at the Information Centre.Should there be any service or quality lapse, HDB will take enforcement action against the contractor. This includes imposing administrative charges and demerit points. If a contractor performs poorly, the contractor may be precluded from tendering for future HDB projects."
labour crunch in maritime industry,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the status of the labour shortage in the maritime industry; (b) how has the labour crunch affected the industry; and (c) whether the Ministry will adjust the current foreign worker quota to help ease the situation.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: The port is an important pillar of Singapore’s economy providing critical connectivity to global markets. To strengthen Singapore’s status as a leading transhipment hub, an adequate pool of skilled manpower is essential to support port operations round the clock.Overall, while manpower is tight, for certain jobs that are physically taxing or require sea-going expertise, such as stevedores or harbourcraft crew, foreign workers complement the local workforce due to a shortage of Singaporeans willing to do the work. Nonetheless, most companies are well within their Dependency Ratio Ceiling (DRC) for the employment of foreign workers.As part of developing the Sectorial Manpower Plan (SMP), the Maritime and Port Authority (MPA) is also working with industry partners and the unions to help more Singaporeans take up sea-faring as well as shore-based careers in the maritime sector. These efforts include putting in place programmes to train more Singaporean seafarers and developing career ladders for various professions in the sector.MPA is also promoting the use of technologies and automation at our port to reduce reliance on manual labour. For instance, MPA is working with PSA to pilot the use of Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs). As port operations expand, the use of AGVs will reduce the need for more foreign port workers.With the implementation of productive technologies and efforts to address the manpower shortage for specific jobs at the port, we do not see a need to adjust the foreign worker quota for this industry at this point of time. We should instead press on with our efforts to drive productivity improvement and accelerate the shift towards a more manpower-lean mode of port operations."
feedback from public consultation on fresh start housing scheme,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry can provide an update on the feedback received from the public consultation on the Fresh Start Housing Scheme.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The Fresh Start Housing Scheme aims to help second-timer families with young children living in public rental housing to own a home again.In November and December last year, MND and HDB held a series of focus group discussions to better understand the challenges that public rental tenants face in owning a home again, and seek views on how to support them in a meaningful way. We consulted former rental tenants who have successfully moved on to homeownership, current rental tenants, as well as social workers and frontline public officers who work with rental tenants.Most of the participants agreed that the Fresh Start Housing Scheme cannot just be a housing scheme, but must include guidance and support for families along their journey to homeownership.There was also broad agreement that the families benefiting from the Scheme must also do their part to get their lives and finances in order. This means that they must show the commitment to find a job and maintain a stable income. At the same time, there was a strong view that the Scheme should focus on the children, and ensure that they are attending school regularly, so that the next generation can make progress and secure a better future.More detailed summaries of the consultation are available on MND’s website. Based on the feedback received, we are now working out the detailed parameters for the Fresh Start Housing Scheme. What is clear is that the Scheme must be more than just the provision of another housing grant and a new flat. It’s about supporting the families in need and helping them to solve their problems holistically. We continue to welcome feedback and will announce more details about the scheme soon."
separating clients' deposits and payments to prevent unlawful withdrawal of funds,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) whether the Ministry will consider enhancing the protection of consumer interests by requiring merchants and sellers to set up and maintain client accounts to keep the deposits/payments separate from their daily operating accounts and making unlawful withdrawals from these accounts a criminal offence.,"Mr S Iswaran: The Government’s approach to consumer protection is based on promoting fair trading among retailers, and helping consumers make informed purchasing decisions. This approach has benefited consumers and businesses, as the vast majority of our retailers are legitimate businesses who want to serve their customers well.As the nature of consumer transactions can vary widely in practice, broad-based requirements such as mandating that deposits be put into escrow accounts would be onerous, and raise the cost of doing business which will ultimately be passed on to consumers.In sectors where deposits are the norm, the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) has worked with sector associations to develop the CaseTrust accreditation scheme. Most businesses accredited under the CaseTrust scheme provide protection for consumers’ deposits. This usually takes the form of business insurance which will compensate consumers if the business becomes insolvent. Currently more than 700 businesses from various sectors offering motoring, renovation and spa and wellness services are CaseTrust accredited. CASE recently announced that it has partnered the Hair and Cosmetology Association (Singapore) to work on CaseTrust accreditation to promote fair trading, improve the sector’s image and raise consumer confidence. CASE is in similar discussions with the Association of Catering Professionals. We encourage more businesses to become accredited as this helps to provide consumers with greater confidence that their interests are safeguarded."
lift upgrading programme for previously ineligible flats,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether HDB can reconsider to (i) offer the Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP) to ineligible flats due to cost considerations (ii) offer LUP again to those blocks of flats that have not been successful if there are changes to the owners of the benefiting units; and (b) whether HDB will withdraw the right of the owners of the benefiting units to ballot if their units have been rented out or they could not be contacted for whatever reasons.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: When the Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP) was introduced in 2001, there were more than 5,300 blocks that did not have direct lift access. Almost 1,000 blocks exceeded the LUP cost cap then. However, over time, HDB developed various cost-effective technical solutions so that more blocks could benefit from LUP. These efforts have reduced the number of ineligible blocks to around 150.Despite HDB’s best efforts, there will still be some blocks where the LUP cannot be offered due to excessively high costs or technical constraints. By necessity, we have to set a financial cap on how much we can build and spend on each benefiting unit. This is so that we spend prudently.For blocks that have failed the LUP polling previously, HDB will evaluate appeals on a case-by-case basis. Key considerations are whether the circumstances have changed since the last polling, and if there is at least 75% support from residents before appealing for LUP to be re-offered. This is regardless of whether there has been any change in owners of the benefiting units.Singaporean flat owners are the eligible voters for LUP. Even if they have rented out their flats, they remain eligible to vote for the LUP. As such, the rights of the owners of the benefiting units to ballot will not be withdrawn. If the eligible voter is unable to cast the vote for the LUP, he can appoint a proxy to vote on his behalf during the polling period."
cpf special or retirement account funds for mortgage arrears,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Manpower whether HDB can reconsider allowing HDB home owners who do not have sufficient savings in their CPF ordinary account to utilise their CPF special or retirement accounts to manage their home mortgage arrears.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: CPF members can use their Ordinary Account (OA) savings for the downpayment, monthly instalments and mortgage arrears for their housing purchase. The Special Account (SA) savings are generally preserved for members’ retirement needs, and cannot be used for housing purposes.When members turn 55, a Retirement Account, or RA, is created. Monies from the OA and the SA are transferred to the RA up to the Full Retirement Sum. The OA continues to exist even after the RA is created. Any remaining OA balance, as well as new contributions to the OA after the age of 55, can be used to meet housing needs. In addition, any RA savings in excess of the Basic Retirement Sum can also be used for housing purposes.HDB proactively helps flat owners manage their arrears early. If their financial difficulty is temporary, HDB will consider reducing or deferring their instalments to help them resolve their arrears. For flat owners who can no longer afford to keep their flats, HDB will help them explore more options, including right-sizing to a more affordable flat.For CPF members who do not have sufficient OA savings to meet their housing needs, we have exercised flexibility where cases merit it. For example, we have, upon appeal, allowed CPF members to use their RA savings that originated from their OA to pay for their housing, even if their RA savings are below their Basic Retirement Sum.Overall, we need to strike a balance between allowing CPF members to use their SA and RA savings for housing needs and safeguarding such savings for their retirement needs, so as not to compromise their retirement adequacy."
upgrading of private estates above 30 years old,Mr Chong Kee Hiong asked the Minister for National Development how many private estates there are that are currently above 30 years old and whether there is a plan to upgrade these estates through the Estate Upgrading Programme by a certain due date.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Since the Estate Upgrading Programme (EUP) was launched in 2000, MND has selected 63 private estates through nine batches of EUP, benefitting more than 46,000 households. There are about five to nine estates selected in each batch. In selecting estates for EUP, we consider the age of the estate as well as the physical conditions. We prioritise the older estates, which have greater need and more opportunities for significant improvement through the upgrading works. These works include installation of park furniture and playground equipment that provide a more conducive environment for community bonding, and footpath improvement to provide better connectivity and accessibility. With the nine batches of EUP, we are making good progress in upgrading the estates that are more than 30 years old.MND aims to offer EUP to more estates. There are slightly more than 20 estates, which are more than 30 years old and have yet to be selected for EUP. We will continue to prioritise these older estates for EUP. The pace of the programme will depend on the resources available. We will also coordinate with other government agencies that are also planning upgrading works, so as to minimise inconvenience to the public."
repairs and maintenance schedule for nature parks,Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether NParks has a maintenance schedule for the nature parks such as that for repairing foot paths and lights; and (b) whether there are any plans to upgrade the foot paths and facilities at the Bukit Batok Nature Park.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: NParks carries out quarterly checks of the amenities within nature parks, and repairs them if necessary. NParks also replaces their lights and footpaths every 15 years, and will consider accelerating the replacement cycle if the conditions warrant it. In addition, NParks responds expeditiously to replace or repair damaged amenities when ad-hoc feedback is received.For Bukit Batok Nature Park, NParks recently completed an extensive series of maintenance works to improve the amenities. For instance, in 2015, NParks upgraded the existing lamps and implemented measures to reduce soil erosion near footpaths.Moving forward, NParks also plans to install a fitness corner with senior-friendly exercise equipment to make Bukit Batok Nature Park even more friendly to users of all ages."
difference between parking fees for surface and multi-storey car parks,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked the Minister for National Development whether there can be a review of the monthly parking fees at HDB estates in particular the fee difference between surface and multi-storey carpark lots.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Parking charges are levied to recover part of the cost of providing and maintaining HDB car parks. As it costs more to provide and maintain multi-storey car parks (MSCPs) compared to surface car parks, the monthly season parking rate is generally higher for MSCPs.Some precincts are served by both surface car parks and MSCPs. As the surface lots are generally nearer to the flats, they are understandably more popular. In some instances, this imbalance in demand has resulted in congestion in some surface car parks while the MSCPs are under-utilised. In these car-parks, one of HDB’s measures to regulate and even out the parking demand is to equalise the monthly parking charges between the surface and MSCPs. However, HDB has no plans to implement island-wide equalisation of season parking charges as there is no widespread imbalance in parking demand today."
"bed capacity requirement for tender of sites for nursing, step-down and long-term care facilities","Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Health (a) whether there is a requirement for land sites released for nursing, step-down and long-term care facilities to have a minimum number of beds to be provided by the tenderer and, if so, why; and (b) whether these facilities need to maintain a minimum proportion of rooms with four beds or more for their patients to receive Government means-tested subsidies for intermediate and long- term care services and, if so, what is this proportion.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: The intermediate and long term care landscape in Singapore has to evolve to meet the needs of an ageing population. MOH is expanding the capacity of nursing home services, and as land is scarce in Singapore, we must ensure efficient use of space so that we have sufficient capacity to meet the increase in needs. The design and layout of nursing homes also has to take into consideration the different care needs of the residents, the required manpower to provide adequate monitoring of the residents and that residents in nursing homes can live in a safe environment.There are currently three main modalities in developing new nursing home capacity.First, MOH develops purpose built nursing homes, and appoints operators through competitive tenders to operate these nursing homes under the Build-Own-Lease (BOL) scheme. Under this approach, MOH fully funds the development cost based on the scope of works and service provisions determined by the Ministry. MOH also directly determines the design of the facility, taking into consideration space norms and site characteristics. Most BOL nursing homes have some four to eight beds per cubicle, but we provide for some single-bedded rooms to cater to instances where patients require clinical isolation. Appointed BOL nursing home operators, whether private or voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs), receive operating subventions to serve subsidised patients, as long as they meet the service requirements under the tender, which include setting aside the bulk of their licenced bed capacity for subsidised residents.Second, MOH also provides co-funding, both capital funding and operating subvention, to VWO operators who want to redevelop or expand their existing nursing home facilities to care for more patients. The funding provided is determined with reference to how MOH will fund our BOL nursing homes.Third, the Government releases suitable land sites and state properties for interested providers to bid, in order to design and develop their nursing homes. As land is scarce and there is still a growing demand for nursing home services, MOH does state a minimum capacity that each site is expected to achieve, with reference to the size of the site and allowable intensity. Within this broad parameter, service providers are free to adopt their own designs for the nursing home facilities as they fund the development costs on their own. MOH does not specify the specific bed configurations or mix in these tenders.Such nursing home operators who develop their own nursing homes can offer to serve subsidised patients under the Nursing Home Portable Subsidy Scheme (PSS) through the government's Requests for Proposals (RFP). The PSS provides additional capacity to supplement subsidised nursing home capacity provided by VWOs and our own BOL facilities. In considering bids from such operators, MOH will consider both quality and the capacity to be offered. Bed configuration is not a factor for consideration."
legislation for two days of eldercare leave per year,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry will consider legislating two days of eldercare leave per year for employees.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: I would like to thank Miss Cheng Li Hui for her suggestion. We recognise that caregiving is no easy feat and caregiving responsibility will become heavier with Singapore's ageing population. We will certainly study this suggestion, taking into consideration the overall leave provision already put in place by employers and the caregiving needs of workers.Some employers offer a range of family-related leave benefits which can be tapped on to care for family members if necessary. For example, Infineon Technologies Asia Pacific Pte Ltd – a semiconductor company, offers two days of family-care leave as well as two days of eldercare leave. The DSO National Laboratories offers two days of family care leave on top of statutory leave and other schemes, such as compassionate leave. Public Service agencies also provide parent-care, paternity and maternity leave, separate from vacation leave. The Tripartite Committee on Work-Life Strategy launched the Tripartite Advisory on Flexible Work Arrangements to help guide employers and employees in implementing flexible work arrangements. The proportion of employers providing at least one form of flexible work arrangement has also gone up from 28% in 2008 to 47% in 2014. About seven in 10 employers also provide unplanned time-off for their employees to attend to personal matters. We encourage more companies to support their employees' caregiving responsibilities, by providing flexible work arrangements or time-off to look after their elderly parents.In addition, the Ministry of Health has been strengthening caregiver support for Singaporeans, particularly those who have to juggle between work and caregiving roles. We have expanded the number of home and community care options to help support the care and social needs of their elderly loved ones during the week when they have to go to work. We have also made respite services more accessible. We have introduced weekend respite services at several eldercare centres across Singapore to support caregivers who may need a few hours off during the weekend. Some nursing homes also offer a respite care programme which provides overnight stay for seniors for a short period. For those looking after a family member with dementia, the Eldersit programme provides an eldersitter to look after the seniors at home and engage them in activities for a few hours when caregiving arrangements are not available.We will continue to work with other Ministries and the union to encourage employers to adopt family-friendly practices, and to strengthen support for working caregivers."
helping pioneers sign up for pioneer generation package and understand medishield life,"Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Finance (a) of the estimated 450,000 persons in the Pioneer Generation group, how many of them have been contacted by the Pioneer Generation Ambassadors (PGAs) so far, (b) how many senior citizens are not included in the Pioneer Generation Package; and (c) whether the PGAs can be tasked to reach out to them as well to help them understand MediShield Life.","Mr Heng Swee Keat: The Pioneer Generation Ambassadors (PGA) Programme was created in August 2014. PGAs, who are volunteers, carry out personalised outreach to Pioneers and their caregivers to explain the benefits of the Pioneer Generation Package (PGP). Since July 2015, PGAs have also been engaging Pioneers and their families to share with them details on MediShield Life (MSHL) and related support measures, such as MSHL PG subsidies and Medisave top-ups.As at end February 2016, 3,000 PGAs have successfully visited 240,000 Pioneers (or about 6 in 10 Pioneers) and their caregivers in their homes. The PGA Programme has made significant progress since its launch given that this form of outreach is very resource-intensive and personalised. Our PGAs will continue to try and reach out to the remaining Pioneers to explain the benefits of both PGP and MSHL.The PGA Programme complements our other mass communications efforts, including print advertorials, TV interstitials and videos. These collective efforts have helped to raise awareness of the PGP and MSHL amongst Pioneers and their caregivers, and provided them assurance that their healthcare costs would be affordable to their families. Based on MCI's survey conducted in August 2015, 96% of Pioneers were aware of the PGP and 87% felt assured that their healthcare costs would be significantly more affordable.Pioneers, who are aged 67 and above this year, make up about 65% of Singaporeans aged 60 and above1. While the PGA Programme is focused on Pioneers, MOH has been reaching out to all Singaporeans on MSHL through mass media publicity efforts and extensive engagement and outreach sessions with community partners, such as People's Association and grassroots organisations. To date, MOH has reached out to over 32,000 Singaporeans through more than 100 broad-based dialogues, roadshows and community events, including individualised financial counselling sessions. MOH will continue its public education efforts on MSHL to all Singaporeans."
regulating private businesses or individuals who collect donations for charitable causes,"Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth what permissions and safeguards are there to govern businesses or individuals who claim to collect public donations on behalf of charitable causes.","Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: Anyone (including businesses and individuals) conducting fund-raising appeals in Singapore for charitable, benevolent or philanthropic purposes are regulated under the Charities (Fund-Raising Appeals for Local and Foreign Charitable Purposes) Regulations 2012. The Regulations spell out the duties and obligations of fund-raisers, which include disclosure of clear and accurate information; proper management and usage of donations; as well as keeping accounting records of donations received and disbursed.Additionally, anyone intending to raise funds for foreign charitable causes is required to apply for a Fund-Raising for Foreign Charitable Purposes (FRFCP) permit from the Commissioner of Charities (COC) prior to the commencement of the appeal.While a permit from the COC is waived for fund-raising appeals for local charitable purposes, a licence from the Police will be required when the fund-raising is conducted in publicly accessible places or from house to house.If in doubt, members of the public can check if a fund-raising appeal is for a registered charity and has a valid permit or licence through the Charity Portal or by using the SMS verification service.If there is reason to believe that a fund-raiser has violated any of the Fund-Raising Regulations, the Office of the Commissioner of Charities will look into the matter. The Commissioner may also invoke his powers to restrict or prohibit the conduct of any fund-raising appeal if there is reason to believe that the appeals have been improperly administered.Fund-raisers should be mindful of their obligations under the Fund-Raising Regulations. They should also ensure that the causes for which they are fund-raising are legitimate, as part of their duty to donors. On the other hand, members of the public should remain vigilant and be discerning in responding to such public appeals so as to avoid falling victim to improper fund-raising activities."
incentives for building owners and developers to provide space for community facilities,"Mr Ang Wei Neng asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry will consider (i) giving further incentives to building owners or developers to provide spaces for community facilities such as childcare centers, eldercare centers, libraries, and community clubs near transport nodes; and (ii) asking HDB to do the same at Town Centres that are near to transport nodes.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Since 2003, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) has been offering gross floor area incentives to building owners and developers to provide spaces for community uses in their commercial developments. Besides incentivising developers to provide public plazas and roof top gardens which can be enjoyed by the community, developers are allowed additional floor space of up to 2,000 square metres or 10% of the maximum allowable floor space for the site, whichever is lower, for community use. To date, there are 33 commercial developments in highly accessible locations that have tapped on this scheme to provide a wide range of community facilities such as childcare centres, eldercare centres, libraries, community clubs and family services centres.URA reviews the scheme regularly to ensure its relevance to the community, and will consider the need for further incentives to building owners or developers.For HDB towns, HDB will continue to work with the relevant government agencies to ensure that the community spaces within each town are adequate and well-distributed, including at the Town Centres near to transport nodes. The respective agencies will assess the demand for the social communal facilities under their purview at the site of each new development, taking into account the population catchment, demographics, and existing facilities in the vicinity. For example, in Sengkang, there is a standalone integrated hub located near to the Sengkang MRT Station that houses community facilities. The upcoming Bedok Integrated Complex located at Bedok Town Centre will also house various community facilities, such as a community club, library, polyclinic, eldercare centre and sports centre."
extension of selective lift replacement programme,Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether there are any more lifts that are eligible for the Selective Lift Replacement Programme (SLRP); and (b) whether HDB has any plans to expand the scope of this programme to include lifts that prematurely become obsolete before HDB's recommended 28-year replacement and/or upgrading guidelines in the interests of passenger safety.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB introduced the Selective Lift Replacement Programme (SLRP) in September 2014 to help Town Councils replace about 750 old lifts that did not come with key safety and security features, such as vision panels and doors with infra-red motion sensors. Following the announcement of SLRP, all Town Councils were informed of the eligible lifts within their estate. This included 56 lifts under the Aljunied-Hougang Town Council. Beyond this list, there are no more lifts eligible for SLRP.Town Councils have the statutory responsibility as well as the duty to residents to carry out the maintenance and cyclical replacement of lifts in HDB estates. This includes the replacement of lifts when they are due as well as regular monitoring and proper maintenance to ensure passenger safety and prevent frequent lift breakdowns."
waiver of replacement fee for damaged identity cards,Mr Darryl David asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether the replacement fee for Identity Cards (ICs) can be waived for those citizens whose ICs have been damaged through fair wear and tear over time; and (b) whether such waivers can be based on a specified period such as one fee-waiver for every 10-year period.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The Identity Card (IC) is made of a highly durable polycarbonate material that has been subjected to stringent tests to ensure its durability. It is not easily damaged with normal handling. Nonetheless, there are a small number of cards that may be damaged due to excessive wear and tear over time.The $60 fee for replacing a damaged IC is to cover the production cost, which includes manpower, material as well as other costs incurred in producing a new card. This fee has remained at the same level for many years.ICA will consider a waiver of the fee for cases which warrant special consideration. This includes situations where the card was damaged due to circumstances beyond the cardholder's control, such as accidents or fire."
divorcees applying to rent or buy hdb flats,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development (a) in each of the past five years, what is the number of divorcees who have (i) applied to either purchase a BTO flat or a flat in the Sale of Balance Flats scheme, or to rent a HDB flat and (ii) purchased a resale flat; and (b) what has been the success rate.","Mr Lawrence Wong: From 2011 to May 2015, about 13,300 divorcees applied for a flat from the HDB under the Build-To-Order (BTO) or Sale of Balance Flats exercises. This translates to between 1,900 and 3,700 applicants each year. Overall, about two in three were invited to select a flat.From 2011 to 2015, about 13,600 divorcees bought a resale flat in the open market. This translates to between 2,300 and 3,000 transactions each year.In the same period, about 12,100 divorcees applied for rental flats. This similarly translates to between 1,500 and 3,700 each year. Overall, about one in two were successful in their application."
progress of installation of cctvs at hdb void decks and common areas,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Home Affairs what is the status and progress of the installation of CCTVs at all HDB void decks and common areas.,"Mr K Shanmugam: As at 15 February 2016, Police have installed Police cameras at about 92% of all HDB blocks and Multi-Storey Car Parks (MSCPs) across Singapore.Police is on track to complete the installation at all HDB blocks and MSCPs by this year.Police will work with HDB to continue to install Police cameras at new BTO flats coming onstream thereafter."
long-term viability of shops in hdb heartlands,Ms Tin Pei Ling asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the Ministry's assessment of the long term viability of shops and businesses in HDB heartlands; and (b) if rents can be maintained for shops and businesses in mature and aged HDB estates during tenancy renewal.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB shops are an integral part of public housing estates. They play an important role in serving the needs of residents by providing convenient access to various goods and services.The last published Business Expectations Survey of HDB shopkeepers in 2013 found that more than eight in 10 shopkeepers intended to continue with their business in the next five years. This proportion has also been on the rise since 2007, suggesting a relatively positive business outlook. The Revitalisation of Shops or ROS scheme was also introduced since 2007 to help enhance the vibrancy and improve the competitiveness of HDB shops.HDB ensures that the rents of HDB shops are determined fairly. For new shops, the rent for the first tenancy is determined through open bidding by shopkeepers. At tenancy renewal, the rent is adjusted to the prevailing market rent. The market rents are assessed by licensed valuers, taking into account recent lettings of comparable premises in the vicinity. Adjustments are also made for the location, size and age of the premises, among other factors.HDB also allows flexibility in tenancy periods of between one and three years. Tenants who prefer more certainty can opt for a two- or three-year tenancy. HDB also has in place assistance measures to stagger rental increases."
consumer education for students,Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Acting Minister for Education (Schools) whether the Ministry will consider introducing a module in schools to learn about consumer education.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: Food and Consumer Education, formerly known as ""Home Economics"", is a compulsory subject for all lower secondary students. In this subject, students learn basic knowledge and skills related to responsible financial management, which lies at the heart of consumer education. In particular, they learn about consumer rights and responsibilities, reliability of advertisement claims and the need for comparative shopping before making a purchase.Beyond this subject, specific aspects of consumer education are integrated into the learning of other subjects that lend themselves well to such discussion. For example, in the Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) curriculum for primary school students, they are introduced to the values of thrift and savings and basic ideas on budgeting. At the upper primary level, students are taught to distinguish between needs and wants so that they can learn to manage finances better in their daily lives.Beyond the formal curriculum, our schools also expose students to other aspects of consumer education through platforms, such as talks, learning journeys and assembly programmes.Collectively, these curricular and co-curricular programmes provide our students with a good foundation in understanding and exercising their rights and responsibilities as consumers."
impact of electro-magnetic waves on residents living near power sub-stations,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the number of power sub-stations that are built near to residential estates; (b) whether studies have been conducted to assess the impact of electro-magnetic fields emitted from the sub-stations on the health of human bodies; and (c) what measures are in place to minimise potential health hazards to residents living near these sub-stations.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Currently, there are 33 electrical transmission sub-stations located near housing estates. The main function of these sub-stations is to step down high voltage electricity to low voltage suitable for usage by households.The electromagnetic field radiation from these electrical sub-stations is extremely low, at about 100 times below the exposure guidelines recommended by the World Health Organisation for the general public.The Energy Market Authority and National Environment Agency have been monitoring, and will continue to closely monitor developments in this area, and work with the Ministry of Health and other relevant authorities to evaluate any new findings from scientific studies on this matter."
"undergraduate scholarships for science, technology, engineering and mathematics courses","Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Prime Minister (a) for each of the years from 2007 to 2012, how many undergraduate scholarships were offered by PSC, DSTA and A*STAR for local students to pursue Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) courses overseas; and (b) how many of these scholars ended up breaking their bonds.","Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): From 2007 to 2012, the Public Service Commission (PSC), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) and Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) awarded a total of 511 overseas undergraduate scholarships for STEM courses or an average of 85 per year.Of these 511 overseas undergraduate STEM scholarship recipients, the majority, or 487, are still studying or working in the various agencies. The remaining 24 left the service before completing their bonds.Other public sector agencies, such as the Public Utilities Board (PUB), Economic Development Board (EDB) and Land Transport Authority (LTA) also offer undergraduate scholarships for STEM courses every year. From 2007 to 2012, approximately 200 scholarships a year were awarded to students to read STEM courses both locally and overseas. This number has been rising since 2013."
measures to limit price hikes on motorcycle coes,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the percentage of motorcycles registered under the Open Category COE in 2015; and (b) whether the Ministry can consider (i) increasing the supply of Category D or motorcycle COEs so as to reduce their COE prices; and (ii) allowing five-year renewals for motorcycle COEs.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: No motorcycles were registered using Certificates of Entitlement (COEs) from the Open Category in 2015.The objective of the COE system is to control the growth of the vehicle population in Singapore so that road traffic remains manageable, and to allocate the supply through market-based pricing. Increasing supply so as to lower COE prices would not be in line with this objective. COE prices should be determined by the market, and the Government does not set any target.Motorcycle owners can renew their COEs for a term of five years, on condition that they deregister their vehicles thereafter."
network of linkways for orchard road malls,Mr Ang Wei Neng asked the Minister for National Development whether he can provide an update on the plan to link up Orchard Road malls by a network of linkways.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) has planned for a series of underground pedestrian links along Orchard Road. These linkways provide a convenient passageway for shoppers, visitors and commuters to connect between major commercial buildings and the underground MRT stations.The URA has been imposing the requirement to build these linkways on new developments along Orchard Road, and also on existing developments when they undergo major works or redevelopment. So far, about 2.5 km of underground linkways have already been implemented."
covered walkways from mrt stations to public hospitals,Mr Ang Wei Neng asked the Minister for Transport whether there is a plan to build covered walkways from MRT stations to public hospitals such as KK Women's and Children's Hospital.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: As part of the Walk2Ride programme, LTA has been building covered walkways to link hospitals to MRT stations within a 400 metre radius. Most of such walkways have been completed. KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital will have a covered walkway to Little India Station in 2017."
cycling offences in past two years (attendance at safe cycling clinic),Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for Transport (a) how many cyclists have been booked for errant or dangerous cycling offences in the past two years; (b) how many complaints have been lodged against errant cyclists in the past year; and (c) how many participants have undergone the Safe Cycling Clinic for Youth since its launch in 2014.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Government agencies received about 600 and 800 complaints of errant cyclists in 2014 and 2015 respectively. They issued about 1,300 summons in 2014 and a similar number in 2015.Since its launch in 2014, the Safe Cycling Clinic for Youth has trained about 150 secondary school students. It is part of a larger suite of programmes to educate the public on safe cycling. For instance, LTA, in collaboration with Government and non-Government bodies, has conducted workshops to educate cyclists on safety at community events and neighbourhood touch points."
monitoring performance of contractors managing maintenance works in private estates,Ms Cheryl Chan Wei Ling asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether controls are in place to monitor performance of contractors managing maintenance works in private estates as there is no equivalent like Town Councils to ensure maintenance works are conducted.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The National Environment Agency (NEA) oversees the cleanliness of public areas in Singapore. Private estates are cleaned at least three times every week by NEA and its cleaning contractors. The actual frequencies of cleaning depend on the ground conditions such as human traffic and natural vegetation.NEA has put in place a system of regular audit checks to monitor the performance level of these cleaning contractors. Besides physically inspecting the maintenance work, NEA officers also assess the progress and outcome of cleaning works through sensors and mobile cameras. Where there are service lapses, the cleaning contractors will be given default points which translate into financial penalties.While the Government will continue to ensure the effectiveness of such cleaning services, we should not rely on cleaners to clean up after us. I would like to urge everyone to take ownership of the environment to keep it clean. It is only through our collective efforts that we can have a truly clean Singapore."
including national wage council's recommendations as requirements in cleaning contracts,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether the payment of the Annual Wage Supplement and annual increment based on the National Wage Council's recommendation for outsourced cleaning workers can be made part of the licensing conditions for cleaning companies.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Under the cleaning licensing regime, cleaning businesses are required to pay resident cleaners according to the wage levels specified in the Order by the Commissioner of Labour. The Order currently adopts the Progressive Wage Model (PWM) for cleaners, which was determined through tripartite negotiations by the Tripartite Cluster for Cleaners (TCC) to provide a pathway for cleaners’ wages to progress with training and improvements in productivity and standards.The PWM is reviewed periodically by the TCC in consultation with various stakeholders including the industry and unions, and takes into consideration the National Wage Council’s (NWC) recommendations.We will work with the Ministry of Manpower to raise the Member's suggestion of payment of Annual Wage Supplement and annual increment as a licensing condition for deliberation by the TCC."
accurately calibrated weighing scales at supermarkets and grocery stores,Mr Chen Show Mao asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) what steps are taken to enforce the requirement that all supermarkets and grocery shops maintain accurately calibrated weighing machines at all times.,"Ms S Iswaran: All weighing and measuring instruments that are used for trade purposes in Singapore have to be registered with SPRING Singapore (SPRING), and verified by authorised verifiers appointed under the Weights and Measures Regulations 2005. Only instruments that meet the relevant International Organization of Legal Metrology standards, and pass verification checks to ensure that they provide accurate measurements are affixed with the weights and measures seals and accuracy labels. Each accuracy label is valid for one year. Traders are required to submit their instruments for re-verification before the validity period lapses.SPRING and its appointed enforcement agency, Certis Cisco, conduct regular spot checks to ensure that traders comply with the verification requirements. In 2015, more than 8,000 instruments were covered by such checks. On average, spot checks are conducted at around 20 different locations every month, including wet markets, supermarkets, post offices and pawnshops. During festive seasons, SPRING steps up enforcement by checking the instruments used at festive bazaars.Traders who are found with instruments that have lapsed validity period will be issued a notice to submit the instrument for verification within 14 days. Traders using non-verified instruments will also be asked to replace them with registered and verified instruments or send the non-verified instruments for verification. SPRING conducts follow-up checks on traders who have been issued notices to ensure compliance. Should any trader fail to comply with the notice, the trader may be penalised under the Weights and Measures Act. A trader who uses an instrument that does not have the weights and measures seal and accuracy label may be fined up to S$5,000 or face up to three months' imprisonment, or both. A trader who uses an instrument that has a lapsed accuracy label may be fined up to S$2,000.Most traders use instruments that comply with the requirements under the Weights and Measures Act. From 2011 to 2015, there were seven infringement cases involving traders that used unregistered instruments. SPRING will continue to ensure that traders use registered instruments with weights and measures seals and valid accuracy labels, and will take action against those that do not comply. SPRING conducts regular outreach and educational activities to raise traders and consumers’ awareness of the requirements under the Weights and Measures legislation. This includes partnering with trade associations, and the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE)."
locations of atms,Dr Tan Wu Meng asked the Prime Minister what are the measures taken by MAS to ensure that retail banks have adequate provisions of automated teller machines (ATM) in HDB precincts so that residents need not walk significant distances to find an ATM.,"Mr Lawrence Wong (for the Prime Minister): There are currently over 2,700 ATMs distributed across Singapore, of which more than 2,300 are operated by the three local banks. This works out to almost four ATMs per square kilometre, which is comparable to the ATM coverage in other major cities, such as Hong Kong and Sydney.Banks take into account factors such as human traffic and the demand for cash in each area when locating their services. Many ATMs are therefore sited at high density locations like MRT stations, bus interchanges, neighbourhood town centres and food centres.In addition, banks like DBS/POSB and HSBC have partnered large retailers to provide cash-back services. For example, DBS/POSB customers may withdraw cash from their bank accounts, when making payments at any 7-Eleven, Cold Storage, Giant, Guardian or Sheng Shiong store. Customers may also deposit and withdraw cash at SingPost outlets. Customers therefore have the convenience of conducting banking transactions when running other errands.In general, based on the availability of bank branches, ATMs, Cash Deposit Machines and non-bank cash withdrawal points across the island, there is adequate access to basic banking services in Singapore. MAS will however continue to monitor banks’ provisions of such services, to ensure convenient access to ATM services."
take-up rates of schemes that encourage smes to hire fresh graduates and interns,Mr Chen Show Mao asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) what are the take-up rates of the schemes aimed at encouraging SMEs to hire fresh graduates and interns such as the SME Talent Programme and SkillsFuture Earn and Learn Programme.,"Ms S Iswaran: The SME Talent Programme (STP) helps local SMEs attract talent from Institutes of Technical Education (ITEs), Polytechnics and Universities by co-funding student internships, study sponsorships and fresh-hire training. Participating students are required to work in the sponsoring SMEs after graduation. In 2015, 155 STP job matches and over 700 STP internships were conducted, benefitting 192 enterprises. This was an increase from the 116 enterprises that benefitted in 2014.SMEs also benefit from the SkillsFuture Earn and Learn Programme (ELP), a work-study programme to encourage fresh graduates from Polytechnics and ITEs to enter industries which they are trained for. The ELP provides these graduates with opportunities to deepen their skills through structured workplace learning and mentorship, as well as competitive starting salaries and clearly-defined career advancement pathways. The programme started in April 2015, and as at December 2015, 144 individuals had been placed in 55 companies across 12 sectors. SMEs have responded positively to the programme, making up about half of the companies that hired new graduates from Polytechnics and ITEs under the ELP in 2015. The ELP will be expanded to more sectors in 2016.SPRING will continue to work with Trade Associations and Chambers, Universities, Polytechnics and ITEs to increase the flow of talent to the SME sector."
sale of land parcels around major mrt interchange stations,Ms Cheryl Chan Wei Ling asked the Minister for National Development how does the Ministry balance the sale of land parcels to private developers around major MRT interchange stations and the management of traffic flow when all developments are ready for occupation.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The sale of residential land parcels near MRT stations provides new homes which offer residents convenient access to public transport.As there can be high traffic volume around major MRT stations arising from the pick-up and drop off of passengers by private vehicles and public buses, Government agencies ensure that the road network can support any additional traffic generated by residents of future developments nearby.If there is a series of land parcels located around an MRT station available for development, these land parcels will be progressively released for sale and development, so that the increase in traffic volume can be managed over a period of time.In addition, before a land parcel is offered for sale, Government agencies will impose requirements on the future developer to prevent potential traffic problems. For example, a developer may be required to carry out road widening and improvement works. There may also be strict requirements on the location of entrance and exit points to the development to prevent any disruption to traffic circulation along the main roads."
early alerts for road diversions using digital message display units,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Transport whether LTA will look into increasing the digital message display units at all major roads/highways to advise motorists to divert early and use alternative roads when an accident ahead is likely to cause traffic slowdown or jams.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: In 2014, LTA had extended the digital message display units under the Expressway Monitoring and Advisory System (EMAS), to also serve major roads, in particular those that are used by motorists as alternatives to the expressways. LTA will continue to regularly review their numbers and locations."
government land for landed housing development to meet demand,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development whether the Government plans to offer land for landed housing development in the next three years to meet the demand for such housing.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: There is currently a substantial supply of about 2,300 landed housing units in the pipeline, the bulk of which remains unsold.Hence, we do not have any plans to provide land for new landed housing developments in the near term.As the unsold inventory is cleared, we will consider releasing more land for new landed housing developments, to better meet the needs of Singaporeans who prefer to live in landed homes."
cycling offences in past two years (attendance at safe cycling clinic),Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for Transport (a) how many cyclists have been booked for errant or dangerous cycling offences in the past two years; (b) how many complaints have been lodged against errant cyclists in the past year; and (c) how many participants have undergone the Safe Cycling Clinic for Youth since its launch in 2014.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Government agencies received about 600 and 800 complaints of errant cyclists in 2014 and 2015 respectively. They issued about 1,300 summons in 2014 and a similar number in 2015.Since its launch in 2014, the Safe Cycling Clinic for Youth has trained about 150 secondary school students. It is part of a larger suite of programmes to educate the public on safe cycling. For instance, LTA, in collaboration with Government and non-Government bodies, has conducted workshops to educate cyclists on safety at community events and neighbourhood touch points."
monitoring performance of contractors managing maintenance works in private estates,Ms Cheryl Chan Wei Ling asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether controls are in place to monitor performance of contractors managing maintenance works in private estates as there is no equivalent like Town Councils to ensure maintenance works are conducted.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The National Environment Agency (NEA) oversees the cleanliness of public areas in Singapore. Private estates are cleaned at least three times every week by NEA and its cleaning contractors. The actual frequencies of cleaning depend on the ground conditions such as human traffic and natural vegetation.NEA has put in place a system of regular audit checks to monitor the performance level of these cleaning contractors. Besides physically inspecting the maintenance work, NEA officers also assess the progress and outcome of cleaning works through sensors and mobile cameras. Where there are service lapses, the cleaning contractors will be given default points which translate into financial penalties.While the Government will continue to ensure the effectiveness of such cleaning services, we should not rely on cleaners to clean up after us. I would like to urge everyone to take ownership of the environment to keep it clean. It is only through our collective efforts that we can have a truly clean Singapore."
including national wage council's recommendations as requirements in cleaning contracts,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether the payment of the Annual Wage Supplement and annual increment based on the National Wage Council's recommendation for outsourced cleaning workers can be made part of the licensing conditions for cleaning companies.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Under the cleaning licensing regime, cleaning businesses are required to pay resident cleaners according to the wage levels specified in the Order by the Commissioner of Labour. The Order currently adopts the Progressive Wage Model (PWM) for cleaners, which was determined through tripartite negotiations by the Tripartite Cluster for Cleaners (TCC) to provide a pathway for cleaners’ wages to progress with training and improvements in productivity and standards.The PWM is reviewed periodically by the TCC in consultation with various stakeholders including the industry and unions, and takes into consideration the National Wage Council’s (NWC) recommendations.We will work with the Ministry of Manpower to raise the Member's suggestion of payment of Annual Wage Supplement and annual increment as a licensing condition for deliberation by the TCC."
obesity and physical activity levels among students and youths,"Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the current level of physical activity of the population according to age groups; (b) whether the proportion of overweight children in our schools is currently on the decline or rise; and (c) whether there are studies or Ministry-led initiatives to monitor the dietary habits, physical activity and healthy weight range of our children and youth.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Health Promotion Board conducts a triennial survey of lifestyle risk factors including dietary habits and physical activity of students in secondary schools, Institutes of Technical Education (ITE), Polytechnics, Junior Colleges/Centralised Institute (JC/CI). The Ministry of Education (MOE) also monitors students’ weight status (measured as BMI-for-age) at the Primary, Secondary and JC/CI levels.During the survey period 2012-2014, the median duration spent on physical activity which includes leisure, school-related physical activities, and walking or cycling while commuting between places was reported at 250 minutes per week for polytechnic students, 339 minutes per week for Secondary and JC/CI students, and 360 minutes per week for ITE students.In another survey conducted by the Ministry of Health in 2013, the median duration spent on physical activity (including leisure, work-related and commuting) was reported to be 450 minutes per week among adults aged 18 to 69 years. It was the highest among the young adults aged 18 to 29 years at 510 minutes per week but at its lowest among adults aged between 30 to 49 years at 420 minutes per week, before rising again in the 50 to 59 age group.The proportion of overweight and severely overweight children in our mainstream schools has increased from 11% in 2011 to 12% in 2015. Various initiatives have been introduced in schools to encourage good dietary habits and regular physical activity to promote health and help in weight management. For example, there are now more healthier options in school canteens. School tuckshop operators are encouraged to use healthier ingredients and healthier food preparation methods. Drinking water is strongly encouraged through extensive presence of water coolers while all beverages sold in schools have to have reduced sugar levels. Through the increase in Physical Education (PE) periods, students’ base participation in sports and physical activities has also increased to at least two hours per week. Other opportunities for physical activities participation include Physical Sports Co-curricular Activities and sports enrichments such as Sports Education Programme, inter-class games and sports carnivals. In addition, parents play a very important role in role-modelling active living and healthy eating for their children. Children develop these habits more effectively when these are done as a family, including the involvement of other care-givers.We will continue to work with the other agencies to monitor the trends of overweight and obesity; levels of physical activity; and other risk factors; in the children, youth and adult populations. Achieving a healthy lifestyle that include active living and healthy eating, need to start from young. In this regard, we are working with partners on a holistic approach to address the health challenges faced by our children and youth, including overweight. We will develop more programmes and initiatives to help them cultivate healthy habits. We will make the necessary announcements in due course."
support for retrenched workers and their families,"Ms Tin Pei Ling asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what help is available to support retrenched workers and their families in an economic downturn; (b) how quickly can help be given; and (c) whether there is sufficient capacity to cope with an increase in social welfare recipients, especially in an economic downturn.","Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: In the event of an economic downturn, different Government assistance schemes and Government-operated or funded services are available to help retrenched individuals and families in financial need. MOM and MSF will work closely with relevant government and community partners to ensure that those in need receive adequate and timely employment, financial and social assistance.To help retrenched workers find jobs, the Ministry of Manpower will scale up employment assistance and training measures.These include place-and-train programmes to help Singaporeans re-skill to take on new jobs and the recently launched Career Support Programme to provide mature Singaporean PMEs with greater opportunities to access mid-level and above jobs. WDA's Jobs Bank is another avenue for individuals to access job opportunities. For individuals who require career coaching, counselling or training advisory services, WDA's Career Centres and NTUC's Employment and Employability Institute (e2i) will organise employer networking sessions, job search related workshops and provide other relevant services. We will also help those unable to find a job immediately to upgrade their skills and become more employable.For Singaporeans who require financial assistance to tide over a difficult period, they can approach their nearest Social Service Office (SSO). MSF's officers will consider their individual or family circumstances. During a downturn, we will expand capacity and exercise greater flexibility in extending help through schemes such as the ComCare Short-to-Medium Term Assistance.Other forms of assistance are also available to help those who have difficulties with housing, healthcare and education costs during a downturn. This includes the temporary reduction or deferment of mortgage instalments for HDB flat owners who face short-term difficulties servicing their HDB loan, Medifund assistance for those unable to afford subsidised healthcare bills, and financial assistance for education-related costs for students from affected families.Some retrenched workers may need support to manage family issues triggered by financial stress. They can also approach the SSO or other social help agencies such as the Family Service Centres (FSCs) or their grassroots leaders. The FSCs, which receive MSF funding, will support the retrenched workers and their families, through casework and counselling, to manage their stress and access appropriate assistance."
effectiveness of existing disease surveillance programmes,Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked the Minister for Health if he can provide an update on our disease surveillance programmes and the challenges and constraints involved in implementing them in our clinics and hospitals.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Ministry of Health has a robust surveillance system to monitor communicable diseases and protect public health. Aside from notifications of infectious disease cases by clinicians and laboratories, MOH also works with hospitals, polyclinics and other government agencies to analyse disease syndromes and trending of different strains of infectious agents.With globalization, there is an increased risk of infectious diseases spreading across borders. We have seen this with Ebola, and more recently with Zika. In addition, infectious diseases can spread from animals to humans, as shown by diseases such as Avian Flu and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. We need to remain vigilant and regularly review our systems and processes to keep an eye on these threats.One important aspect of an effective surveillance system is for our healthcare workers to look out for suspicious cases and report them promptly. In doing so, we should be careful not to increase the administrative burden on our healthcare workers, so that they can continue to focus on their core work and patient care. We need to make good use of Information Technology and data analytics to streamline our reporting processes and continually improve the national surveillance and response system.MOH is also enhancing our national capacity and capabilities in infectious diseases. We will work closely with the Institute of Infectious Diseases and Epidemiology on prevention, surveillance and response. Building on this collaboration, we will set up the National Centre for Infectious Diseases by 2018 to serve as the national facility for outbreak prevention and containment.Through these efforts, we aim to bring together the collective efforts of all stakeholders, so that we can work together to protect Singapore from existing and emerging threats of infectious diseases."
employment rights of tertiary students who work part-time,"Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) what steps are in place to educate students from Institutes of Technical Education, polytechnics and universities, who work as part-timers during their school holidays or after school hours, on their employment rights so that they are not disadvantaged by their employers.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: Various measures are taken to educate students on their basic employment rights, especially for those involved in part-time jobs. At the national level, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and the Central Provident Fund (CPF) Board have stepped up public education and outreach efforts on the Employment Act and CPF Act via the WorkRight initiative since 2012. Recent efforts include social media videos on Facebook and mobile clinics across 16 locations in the heartlands in January 2016. Both workers and students can also find out and verify their employment rights at the MOM website.At the institutions level, the Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) have supplemented national efforts with their own initiatives. Some initiatives include ensuring that staff at the Career Guidance Offices are educated on the Employment Act and can provide first-line advice to students, and making resources available to students through their online career resource portals. At the Institute of Technical Education (ITE), basic employment rights under the Employment Act are highlighted to ITE students as part of their 40-hour Education and Career Guidance (ECG) curriculum introduced in January 2015. This covers details such as the maximum number of working hours in a week, and the timeframe within which employers must pay their salaries.The IHLs also use guidebooks provided by WorkRight to educate their graduating students about their employment rights. I look forward to the IHLs working even closer with the National Trade Union Congress (NTUC)'s Professionals, Managers and Executives Unit, and its U-Care Centre, to better educate our students on their employment rights, be it through on-campus talks or roadshows."
impact of mas's imposition of borrowing limit on easing of individual indebtedness,Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Prime Minister whether there has been a gradual easing of individual indebtedness as a result of MAS's imposition of the aggregated borrowing limit of 12 months' income.,"Mr Lawrence Wong (for the Prime Minister): MAS announced in April 2015 that the limit on the amount of unsecured credit that a borrower can take on across all financial institutions (FIs) would be phased-in over four years. The borrowing limit was set at an initial level of 24 times a borrower’s monthly income from 1 June 2015. This will be lowered progressively to 18 times from 1 June 2017 and 12 times from 1 June 2019.Since the introduction of the borrowing limit, the number of borrowers with unsecured debt exceeding 24 times of monthly income has approximately halved, from around 32,000 in February 2015 to around 17,000 in November 2015. This reduced number represents around 1% of all unsecured credit borrowers.The number of borrowers whose unsecured debt exceeds 12 times their monthly income has also dropped by about 14%, from around 84,000 borrowers in February 2015 to around 72,000 borrowers in November 2015. This reduced number makes up about 4% of all unsecured credit borrowers.The vast majority of borrowers use credit prudently and are not affected by the aggregate borrowing limit. We encourage indebted borrowers to reduce their outstanding unsecured debts over time. They can seek help from their FIs or Credit Counselling Singapore, which can help work out repayment plans and offer various assistance schemes."
application rate for additional childcare subsidy for non-working mothers,"Ms Sun Xueling asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) in 2015, how many applications have been received for additional childcare subsidies from non-working mothers and how many applications have been approved; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider liberalising the qualifying criteria for additional childcare subsidies for non-working mothers, for instance those who have to care for multiple children and the elderly at home.","Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: All parents of Singaporean children, regardless of their working status, are eligible for basic childcare subsidies. Other forms of support, such as the Baby Bonus Cash Gift and Child Development Account matched savings, are also available to help parents defray the cost of raising children. As working mothers have a greater need for childcare, we provide them added assistance in the form of additional childcare subsidies.We recognise that some mothers who are not working full-time may also need childcare services for various reasons. These reasons may include long-term illness, disability, retrenchment, training or skills upgrading or other extenuating circumstances such as needing to care for other dependants in the family. For such cases, we exercise flexibility and consider their circumstances on a case-by-case basis for additional childcare subsidies.On this basis, 660 non-working mothers were provided additional childcare subsidies in 2015. This was out of 760 applicants."
projected tourist arrivals and hotel rooms with completion of terminal 4,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) what is the projected number of tourist arrivals upon the opening of Changi Airport Terminal 4 and what is the number of hotel rooms that will be opened to meet the projected number of arrivals.,"Mr S Iswaran: Changi Airport Terminal 4 is expected to open in 2017. An additional 5,700 hotel rooms will be completed by 2017, and a further 2,800 will be built from 2018 to 2020. This is sufficient to support the projected visitor arrivals growth in the medium term. The Singapore Tourism Board (STB) is constantly monitoring demand trends, and will continue to work with industry partners and other relevant agencies to ensure that there is sufficient hospitality infrastructure to cater to the projected growth in visitor arrivals.Apart from hospitality infrastructure, STB will also continue to work closely with industry to identify and support innovative tourism hardware and software development, while improving our capabilities. This is in line with STB's approach to Quality Tourism to achieve sustainable tourism growth in the longer term."
adequacy of speed limit signs,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the present number of speed limit signs on all our roads are sufficient; (b) whether the distance interval between each sign is adequate for motorists; and (c) whether there is a plan to increase the speed limit signs in view of the speed limit monitors/cameras to be installed.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The speed limit on all our roads is 50km/h, unless otherwise stated. This is in the Highway Code and also part of the driving test syllabus. Roads with speed limits other than 50km/h are clearly marked by signs. These are placed between 500m and 1km apart. Advance warning signs are also placed about 100-150m before speed cameras.We regularly review the sufficiency of speed limit signs. But the best safeguard for motorists is not to speed at all times."
singapore's response to malaysia's imposition of higher vehicle permit fees at the causeway and second link,"Mr Ang Wei Neng asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry will consider adjusting the Vehicle Entry Permit Fee, toll charges or other related fees given that the Malaysian Government has decided to impose RM20 on Singapore-registered vehicles entering Malaysia at the Causeway and Second Link.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: If Malaysia’s proposed Road Charge on non-Malaysia-registered vehicles entering Malaysia via Johor discriminates against Singapore-registered vehicles, we will match it in some form. Currently, we do not yet have the details of the final Malaysian proposal."
public education and resolution of online commercial crime,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is the solving rate for online commercial offences; (b) whether the current legislative powers are sufficient for our law enforcement officers to tackle such cases effectively; and (c) what other measures is the Ministry implementing to improve the situation.,"28 Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what steps is the police taking to address the significant spike in online commercial crime cases; and (b) whether the public education measures taken by the police have been effective.Mr K Shanmugam: Online commercial crime nearly doubled from 1,929 cases in 2014 to 3,759 cases in 2015. Examples of such crimes include cheating involving e-commerce, credit-for-sex scams and Internet love scams. Police are taking active steps to address this increase. First, Police are stepping up local enforcement efforts. In 2015, Police conducted four island wide enforcement operations targeting online scams and arrested 139 persons. Persons found to be perpetrating an online scam or who knowingly assist foreign syndicates in such criminal activities will be investigated and prosecuted.Second, Police work closely with their foreign counterparts to foil such syndicates. For example, Police received reports of credit-for-sex scams committed by syndicates operating in China last year. As a result of collaboration between SPF and their Chinese counterparts, the Chinese police conducted simultaneous raids and detained 43 members of one such syndicate.Third, Police are reviewing our laws to enhance the powers for officers to deal with online crime.Fourth, Police have stepped up public education programmes, to raise awareness and prevent the public from falling victim to scams. Online crimes are particularly hard to solve because of the borderless nature of the internet. A significant proportion of online commercial crimes are committed remotely by foreign syndicates. Despite our best efforts in going after the perpetrators in such online commercial crimes, they will find new ways to exploit and prey on the vulnerabilities of potential victims, and hide themselves from law enforcement agencies. Awareness and prevention are therefore critical in addressing the rise in such crimes.SPF and NCPC launched a dedicated anti-scam website, www.scamalert.sg, as a one-stop resource to keep the public abreast of the latest scams and the modus operandi of various scams. The website has attracted more than 170,000 visitors since its launch in November 2014.Police also reach out to the public at locations with high human traffic, for example, displaying posters at hawker centres, bus stops, and train stations. Crime prevention commercials are also aired on local TV channels and at over 500 office buildings. Police will continually review and improve these public education measures to ensure they stay relevant and effective.Ultimately however, beyond public education and outreach efforts, it is about how we as individuals and families are aware about the threats on the Internet and how vigilant and alert we are. We have to be cautious when we are online as the stranger on the other side may not be who he says he is, and when the offer sounds too good to be true."
bogus charges for business registration services,Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for Finance what actions are taken by the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) to protect companies or businesses from being misled or deceived into paying for registration services purportedly rendered by ACRA or its related agencies.,"Mr Heng Swee Keat: The Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority or ACRA is the only statutory body responsible for the registration of companies and businesses in Singapore.ACRA does not condone any attempt to use its name or a name resembling that of ACRA's to deceive or cause confusion to the public. ACRA will not hesitate to investigate suspected breaches and prosecute offenders. Under the ACRA Act, an offender will face a maximum penalty of $10,000 and six-month imprisonment, as well as a further fine of up to $250 per day for a continuing offence after conviction.While non-Government organisations can collect information from companies through private agreements, there are safeguards against such organisations trying to pass themselves off as Government entities. Letters from government agencies, such as ACRA, have distinct letterheads, with their names and logos. Companies and other business entities are also required to state their name and registration number in all business correspondences. Those who breach this requirement are liable for a maximum fine of $1,000. In the past four years, ACRA has investigated 10 business entities for failing to properly state their name and/or registration number.In addition to having these safeguards in place, companies should exercise vigilance when dealing with any unsolicited letter or email from third parties. First, companies should check the identity of the third party or check with ACRA before engaging third parties. Companies can make use of the free business entity search function on ACRA's website to verify the identity of the third party. Second, companies should peruse carefully all the terms and conditions set out by the third party before entering into any form of agreement. Third, companies should alert ACRA if there are any suspected wrongdoings or misrepresentations by third parties. Where companies become a victim, they should make a police report."
impact of ns ippt scheme enhancement on first-attempt pass rate,Mr David Ong asked the Minister for Defence whether the recent enhancement to the NS IPPT system has improved the passing rate of the IPPT test for NSmen on their first attempt.,"Dr Ng Eng Hen: The MP has asked for comparisons of results following the change in the IPPT format from its previous five to the current three-station format. I propose to provide the data using results of the 2.4 km run and the sit-ups, as these are the two stations that were common to both formats.Operationally Ready National Servicemen (NSmen) have performed better in both these stations after the format was changed. They achieved on average an improvement of 5 sit-ups and ran 16 seconds faster for the 2.4km. Compared to the previous format, the new scoring system encourages NSmen to go all out for each station, to compensate for lower scores in any one station. NSmen can also better focus on their training with fewer stations in the new format. For the push-up station, which is new, NSmen were able to perform above the median number required in each age category. For example, Full-time National Servicemen on average did 49 push-ups, while NSmen aged 34-39 performed an average of 30 push-ups within the minute stipulated. The overall pass rates for all those who took IPPT in the new format varied from 70% to 97%, depending on selected age categories.The total number of NSmen who received IPPT monetary awards for achieving the standards for Gold, Silver, and Pass with Incentive has also increased. The proportion of NSmen who received Gold and Silver awards increased by 4% to about 30%, and the proportion of NSmen who received Pass with Incentive awards increased by 9% to about 30%. The results of the new IPPT format are therefore very encouraging and indicate that the change has motivated NSmen to train and perform better. The SAF is confident that more NSmen will show improvement in their IPPT as they become familiar with the new format. The SAF will continue to support NSmen through a variety of IPPT Preparatory Training (IPT) programmes and the IPT-in-the-Park initiative to make fitness training more convenient, flexible and effective. Better fitness will ensure that NSmen are better prepared for their operational demands."
utilisation of activesg$100 credits,"Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) what has been the utilisation of ActiveSG$100 since its launch in 2014; (b) whether the Ministry has intentions to top up the amount to encourage Singaporeans to lead active lifestyles; and (c) whether a special concession for Pioneer Generation cardholders can be allowed for them to use sports facilities for free.","Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: ActiveSG, the national movement for sport, was launched in April 2014. We are encouraged to see a growing membership that stands at more than 980,000 today. Thus far, almost two thirds have started to utilise their $100 ActiveSG credits to book a sports facility or sign up for a sports programme.The ActiveSG credits were intended to encourage members to kick-start an active lifestyle and for them to experience the various sports facilities and programmes. Originally meant for a limited period, we announced in November last year that the credits will not expire so long as members continue to use them at least once a year. The $100 ActiveSG credits will be provided to new members who joined after 2015. We do not have any plans to top up the accounts of existing members.Sport Singapore is committed to ensuring that ActiveSG sports facilities and programmes are kept affordable to encourage Singaporeans to lead active lifestyles. For example, admission to swimming pools does not cost more than $1.50 on weekdays and $2 on weekends, whilst walk-in gym admissions cost $2.50. Several of the programmes organised by ActiveSG, such as Sundays @ the Park, are free.As part of the SG50 Seniors Package, we gave an additional top-up of $25 ActiveSG credits to ActiveSG members aged 55 years and above in 2015. This is on top of the $100 ActiveSG credits received by all new members. All senior citizens (aged 55 and above) who are ActiveSG members also enjoy special discounted rates for admission to our gyms and swimming pools."
updates on licensing irregularities at singapore rifle association and singapore gun club,Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether he can provide an update on the 'serious licensing irregularities' discovered at the Singapore Rifle Association and Singapore Gun Club respectively in light of the current security environment; and (b) whether any firearms have been found missing or illegally removed from the armouries of these clubs.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The Singapore Rifle Association (SRA) and Singapore Gun Club (SGC) are shooting clubs which have historically been licensed by the Police to allow Singaporeans to pursue shooting as a sport. Both shooting clubs operate separate armouries co-located at the National Shooting Centre.On 4 February 2016, following an inspection of the SRA and SGC armouries, the Police took into custody several arms which the clubs were not able to produce valid licences for. All arms with licence were however accounted for, and none were missing from the armouries. Police investigations into these arms without valid licences are still ongoing at this stage.In the interim, the Singapore Shooting Association, the national sports association for shooting, has been issued a licence to take charge of the armouries and arms within the National Shooting Centre. While Police investigations are still ongoing, access to the Centre has since been strictly confined to national shooters from the Singapore Shooting Association and other persons specifically granted permission by the Police.Alongside ongoing investigations, the Police are concurrently conducting a holistic review of the overall security of the National Shooting Centre and will work with Sport Singapore and the Singapore Shooting Association to ensure that the security measures and processes at the National Shooting Centre are robust and satisfy all licensing requirements."
non-citizen single parents with singaporean children in hdb rental flats,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar asked the Minister for National Development (a) how many non-permanent resident/non-citizen widows/widowers with Singaporean children are currently renting a HDB flat; and (b) what are the available housing options for single mothers or fathers with Singaporean children.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: There are currently 31 public rental tenants who are non-Singapore Citizen (SC) or non-Singapore Permanent Resident (SPR) widows/widowers with Singaporean children. In general, they were allowed to retain the flat upon the demise of their SC spouses who had been the tenants of the flats.Single parents who are widowed or divorced and have an SC child may buy a flat from HDB, or a resale flat on the open market if they meet the prevailing eligibility criteria, such as the citizenship requirement and income ceiling.Single unmarried parents have the same housing options as singles. If they are SCs aged 35 and above, and have not received a housing subsidy before, they may buy a new 2-room Flexi flat in a non-mature estate, or a resale flat. They may also be eligible for housing grants.Single parents in hardship who have no other viable housing options or family support could also rent a flat from HDB on a case-by-case basis."
activation of traffic diversions to ease traffic during oil spills,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the procedure to activate traffic diversions to ease traffic jams when there is a major oil spill or accident on a busy road; (b) how long does it take to despatch the police to activate these diversions; (c) how long does it take to disseminate traffic news to the public to avoid the affected roads; and (d) what is the normal platform used in disseminating this traffic news.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Once a report of a major traffic incident or oil spill is received, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and the Traffic Police will assess its severity. If traffic diversion is needed, the nearest Traffic Police resources will be mobilised. Traffic diversions are implemented swiftly once the Traffic Police arrives on scene, which is typically within 30 minutes of the report being received. Traffic advisories are immediately disseminated through various radio and online channels, such as the LTA Traffic News radio broadcast, the OneMotoring website, smartphone apps such as MyTransport.sg and LTA's traffic news Twitter account."
impact of recent cpf changes on number and amount of cpf top-ups,Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for Manpower what has been the impact of recent CPF changes on the number and amount of CPF top-ups that CPF members can make to (i) their own CPF accounts and (ii) their family members' CPF accounts.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: Since January 2016, CPF members can transfer CPF savings above the Basic Retirement Sum (BRS) to their spouse's Special or Retirement Account. Previously, they could only do so when their CPF savings were above their Full Retirement Sum (FRS).There were over 400 transfers of CPF savings to spouses in January 2016, about two and half times more than the same month last year. These transfers to spouses totalled $12 million. About 1 in 20 of these transfers were made by members with CPF savings above their BRS but below their FRS. We expect more CPF members to benefit from this change over time.Since January 2016, CPF members above the age of 55 can have their Retirement Account topped-up to the current Enhanced Retirement Sum (ERS), instead of the FRS previously. In the month of January 2016, there were 1,700 such top-ups, with a total top-up sum of $80 million."
complaints about and bookings of errant cyclists,Ms Sun Xueling asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the number of incidents of cyclists colliding into pedestrians on footpaths in 2015; (b) what are the penalties meted out; and (c) how many complaints have been received in 2015 on near misses between cyclists and pedestrians on footpaths.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: In 2015, Government agencies received about 800 complaints of errant cyclists and issued about 1,300 summonses. Of these summonses, about 300 were related to cycling on footpaths, but not all of these would have involved collision between cyclists and pedestrians. Agencies currently do not maintain statistics on the specific type of cycling incidents.Cyclists who injure pedestrians because of rash behaviour may be prosecuted in Court. Upon conviction, the cyclist may be punished with a fine of up to $5,000, or an imprisonment term of up to one year, or both."
utilisation rates of scdf's first-responder apps for civilians,Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what has been the utilisation rate and number of users following SCDF's launch of the Save-a-Life initiative and myResponder mobile app to enhance emergency response; and (b) whether there are plans to expand the reach to more public and private spaces and to more members of the public who are trained in cardio-pulmonary resuscitation and with using automated external defibrillators.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) launched the Save-A-Life Initiative in August 2015, to increase the survival rate of cardiac arrest victims by building a network of trained community first responders to respond to cardiac arrest cases in their immediate vicinity.As part of the Save-a-life initiative, the SCDF will install AEDs at the lift lobbies of HDB blocks, with one AED for every two to three blocks. The first phase was implemented from August last year where 160 AEDs were installed in six constituencies Bedok, Bukit Panjang, Choa Chu Kang, Pasir Ris West, Radin Mas, and Tampines West. Another 227 AEDs will be installed this year at these constituencies. We will progressively extend this to all HDB estates by 2018.The AED installation will be accompanied by training for residents to be community responders. SCDF has worked with the Ministry of Health and the People's Association to provide CPR and AED training to community responders through the ""Dispatcher Assisted first Responder"" (DARE) programme. To date, about 300 residents have been trained in each of the six pilot constituencies.Residents and members of the public who are trained in CPR and AED skills are then encouraged to download the SCDF myResponder Mobile app and register themselves as Community First Responders. In the event of a cardiac arrest case, SCDF will notify, through the app, Community First Responders in the vicinity to respond. Since its launch in April 2015, the app has been downloaded about 9,000 times. The Community First Responders have been alerted to more than 3,800 cardiac arrest cases.Apart from our neighbourhoods, SCDF is working with MOH and the Singapore Heart Foundation to encourage more public and private establishments to install AEDs and train their staff. All schools, community centres, sports stadiums, SAF camps and Home Team facilities have already installed AEDs. A recent initiative that SCDF implemented last November was with SMRT and Temasek Cares to install AEDs in 100 SMRT taxis. In the event of a cardiac arrest case, the trained taxi driver can quickly go to the scene to help.SCDF will continue to expand the reach of its ‘Save-A-Life’ initiative to enhance community self-help and to improve the survival rate of cardiac arrest cases."
schools' assistance to ensure dsa students fulfil academic requirements,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Acting Minister for Education (Schools) given the recent experience of students at Raffles Institution who took the GCE ""O"" Level examinations, (a) how do schools help students who gain entry under the Direct Schools Admission (Secondary) Exercise (DSA-Sec) to juggle the schools' academic demands and their sporting commitments; and (b) what is the academic track record of students who have joined a secondary school under the DSA-Sec over the past three years.","Mr Ng Chee Meng: The Direct School Admission (DSA) scheme was introduced to promote holistic education by reducing the emphasis on examination results and recognising a more diverse range of non-academic talents, achievements and personal qualities. Schools participating in DSA are committed to develop students to their fullest potential in both their studies and areas of talent, and have put in place a range of programmes and support structures to help DSA students balance academic demands and CCA commitments.Schools help students who face academic challenges, regardless of whether they entered via DSA or not in two broad ways. Firstly, they make efforts to know these students, their learning styles, their strengths and difficulties and what motivates them. Many schools ensure that their DSA students are assigned teacher mentors and class buddies. There are regular discussion sessions with the DSA students and dialogues with parents to better understand the students’ needs. With this knowledge, schools can then provide targeted academic support, structured guidance and adjust their curriculum and programmes to better cater to them.Secondly, schools monitor these students closely. Schools track the academic performance of DSA students and have regular platforms to discuss whether and what kind of interventions are necessary. Schools also monitor the social-emotional well-being of these students and work in partnership with their parents to ensure that the students are doing well.Overall, the ""O"" Level performance of students admitted via DSA-Sec is comparable to their non-DSA peers with similar PSLE results. Of the three batches of DSA students who have sat for ""O"" Levels from 2013 to 2015, about 80% of them were eligible for Junior Colleges.Overall, DSA has broadened the definition of merit and promoted holistic education by reducing the emphasis on national examination results. As with all of our policies, we will continue to regularly review and improve the DSA scheme."
compliance rate for national childhood and adolescent immunisation schedule,"Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked the Minister for Health with regard to the National Childhood and Adolescent Immunisation Schedule (a) what is the compliance rate for Singaporeans and foreign students, including permanent residents; (b) what measures are taken when parents do not comply; and (c) whether there have been any reported adverse effects caused by the immunisations in the last three years.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Vaccinations under the National Childhood Immunisation Schedule (NCIS) are recommended as the standard of care to protect children against certain infectious diseases. Vaccinations against measles and diphtheria are compulsory in Singapore. The take up rates for measles and diphtheria vaccinations are high among Singaporeans and Permanent Residents, with coverage in children aged two years maintained at around 95% or higher in the last five years. The high vaccination coverage confers herd immunity and reduces the risk of disease outbreaks. As measles and diphtheria vaccinations are bundled together in the form of combination vaccines with vaccinations on the NCIS for other diseases such as mumps, rubella, whooping cough, polio, and tetanus, herd immunity is achieved for these diseases as well.MOH has taken an educational approach to encourage parents to comply with vaccinating their children. The National Immunisation Registry under the Health Promotion Board (HPB) tracks pre-school children, and sends letters to remind parents to bring their children for vaccination if they have not done so. HPB’s School Health Service actively follows up on unvaccinated children in primary schools. This has worked well and resulted in high levels of vaccination coverage among our children.The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) has in place a robust surveillance system to closely monitor the safety of vaccines used here. In the last three years, while there were reports of adverse reactions suspected to be associated with vaccines, majority of the reports relate to known adverse reactions, such as injection-site swelling or pain, fever and febrile fits.We will continue to work with HPB to monitor the take up rate of vaccines under the NCIS and, at the same time, enhance educational efforts to ensure that high vaccination coverage is maintained to protect our population."
recruitment efforts of singapore police force,Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what are the plans to attract more Singaporeans to join the Singapore Police Force (SPF); (b) what is the status of the Home Team's re-employment efforts; and (c) whether the SPF plans to assign more non-policing activities to civilian officers and allow uniformed officers to take on more operational roles.,"Mr K Shanmugam: Over the last 10 years, the number of Police Officers has increased by about 18%, from 8,000 to 9,400. While it is more challenging to recruit officers with fewer Singaporean new entrants joining the workforce each year, SPF has kept the Police career attractive by offering meaningful and exciting jobs, competitive terms and conditions, as well as good career development and advancement prospects.SPF is currently working on providing more seamless advancement opportunities for its officers by placing degree and non-degree holders on a single scheme of service. It is also introducing specialist career tracks to develop officers with deep expertise in specialist domains. Police jobs especially at the frontline will be redesigned to make greater use of data, technology and automation, with streamlined work processes.In October 2013, the retirement age of Police Officers was extended from age 50 to 55. This enables our older Police Officers to continue their contributions to the Home Team.After age 55, Police Officers may be offered re-employment depending on organisational needs. This is subject to performance, conduct and fitness criteria. About 60% of retired Police Officers were re-employed by SPF in the past five years, to both Police and civilian jobs.To allow our Police Officers to perform their core policing functions, more civilian officers have been recruited to take on civilian specialist roles. The Home Team Specialist Scheme was introduced in 2010 for civilian officers to take on specialised roles in areas such as engineering, technology, crime scene investigations and forensics. There are currently 290 civilian specialist officers in the Police Force. They play an important role in complementing Police Officers to maintain law and order and to fight crime."
review of arts fund guidelines,"Mr David Ong asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) what has been the take-up rate for the Arts Fund over the last five years; and (b) whether NAC will consider reviewing its funding guidelines, in particular the measurable indicators.","Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: Administered by the National Arts Council (NAC), the Arts Fund was set up by the Tote Board to bring the arts to the wider community.Following a review in 2011, the Arts Fund sharpened its funding guidelines to encourage arts groups to reach out to new audiences with quality performances that resonate with Singaporeans. Artistic excellence has remained an important criterion. This is in line with the twin goals of the Arts and Culture Strategic Review to support arts excellence as well as make the arts an integral part of the lives of our people. There was an increase in funding provided by Tote Board from $750,000 to $1.5 million per year from FY2012 onwards.The take-up rate from FY2011 to FY2015, has been healthy at about 100% in FY2011, 80% in FY2012, 95% in FY2013, 100% in FY2014 and 75% for FY2015 thus far.After the implementation of these funding guidelines, we have seen a growth in the audiences reached under the Arts Fund, from around 220,000 in FY2012 to a projected 340,000 by end of FY2015. This indicator, together with measures of audience satisfaction continue to be relevant indicators given the objectives of the Arts Fund."
update on hdb's goodwill repair assistance scheme,"Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for National Development (a) from 2013 to 2015, what is the number of HDB home owners who have been beneficaries of the ""Goodwill Repair Assistance"" (GRA) scheme; and (b) whether HDB has received feedback that the shared percentage of 25% of the repair cost required of both the upper-floor and lower-floor units is unfair and unjustifiable for the homeowner living at the lower unit.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Under the HDB lease, the repair of ceiling leaks is the joint responsibility between the upper- and lower-floor flat owners. From time to time, HDB has received feedback from lower-floor flat owners about having to co-pay the repair costs of ceiling leaks.To lessen the financial burden on flat owners faced with a leaking ceiling situation, HDB introduced the Goodwill Repair Assistance (GRA) scheme. Under this scheme, HDB will pay 50% of the ceiling leak repair cost. The remaining 50% is then shared equally between the upper- and lower-floor flat owners.The GRA scheme not only reduces the financial burden on the lower-floor lessee but also helps expedite such repairs by assisting the upper-floor lessee as well. From 2013 to 2015, HDB assisted with about 22,900 ceiling leak repairs under the GRA scheme.Notwithstanding this, lower-floor lessees who prefer not to use the GRA scheme and wish to approach their upper-floor neighbours to make their own arrangements are free to do so."
monitoring lift maintenance and repair,Ms Sun Xueling asked the Minister for National Development (a) what recourse do residents have apart from calling up the Essential Maintenance Services Unit to repair lifts that constantly break down; and (b) whether maintenance frequencies can be increased for lifts that constantly break down and their performance stability monitored so as to re-establish confidence for users of these lifts.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Town Councils have the statutory responsibility to carry out maintenance of lifts in HDB estates. Therefore, besides contacting the Essential Maintenance Services Unit appointed by their Town Council, residents may also call their Town Council directly if they encounter lift breakdowns.Under the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act (Lift and Building Maintenance) Regulations, all lifts must be maintained at least once a month. However, Town Councils can work with their appointed lift servicing contractors to review whether a higher maintenance frequency is needed for specific lifts. This can be done with the help of the Tele-Monitoring System (TMS) installed in all HDB blocks, which provides data on lift performance including lift breakdown rates."
supply and demand for pilots,Ms Tin Pei Ling asked the Minister for Transport whether the demand for pilots in Singapore meets the supply of trainees from local pilot academies and what is done to help the trained pilots secure job placements.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: There are four approved pilot training academies in Singapore. Over the last two years, about 240 pilots graduated from these academies. About 80% of them were from Singapore carriers' cadet pilot programmes. The remaining 20% were self-sponsored.Singapore carriers prefer to recruit new pilots through their own cadet pilot programmes, as they can then carefully screen and assess the candidates even before they commence their training. This approach also allows the airlines to better match their recruitment needs against their fleet growth plans.MOT and CAAS do not interfere in the recruitment decisions of Singapore carriers, as it is their responsibility to determine the suitability of each candidate for their company."
paper road tax discs,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the purpose for the road tax disc to be displayed on motor vehicles; and (b) whether the LTA will consider doing away with the paper road tax disc.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The paper road tax disc, which has to be displayed on the windscreen, shows that the vehicle has been licensed by the Land Transport Authority (LTA), has adequate insurance coverage and complies with all other regulatory requirements. In recent times, Singapore Government agencies do not rely on the discs for checks on vehicles anymore, as they do these checks electronically. We have therefore been studying doing away with the discs.However, for Singapore-registered vehicles entering Malaysia, the Malaysian authorities still rely on the discs as proof that the vehicle complies with LTA's regulatory requirements. LTA is reviewing how we can address the Malaysian authorities’ concerns."
