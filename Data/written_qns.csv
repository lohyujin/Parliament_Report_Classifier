initiatives to promote inter-generational collaboration and actions in tackling issues facing singaporeans,"Ms Ng Ling Ling asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth what are the existing platforms or initiatives that the Ministry has created to promote inter-generational collaboration and actions in tackling the issues facing Singaporeans, including the ageing population and shift in workforce composition going forward.","Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai: MCCY brings together Singaporeans from across generations to build consensus on issues that matter to them, and plan our future together. Some examples are as follows:(a) We engage Singaporeans to forge our shared identity, and to think about the values and legacy we want to leave behind for future generations. More than 80,000 people of all ages contributed their ideas and views to the Founders' Memorial to date.(b) This year, in spite of the on-going pandemic, 74 Singaporeans aged between 17 and 73 are working together to create content to update the Singapore Citizenship Journey for new citizens.(c) In June 2020, DPM Heng Swee Keat launched the Singapore Together Emerging Stronger Conversations, for Singaporeans young and old to come together, reflect on the COVID-19 crisis, and contribute their views on how Singapore can emerge from it stronger and more resilient. The conversations will lead to Singapore Together Action Networks – collaborations formed around the salient issues that emerge from the conversations – these too will reflect inter-generational involvement.There are other initiatives to encourage meaningful connections between the young and the old, and which recognise how our ageing population can still be a force for good when coupled with the strengths of our youth.(a) Seniors have stepped up to be part of the Mentoring Alliance to mentor youths; (b) Youth Corps Singapore's Eldercare Cluster has regular youth-led initiatives such as Cantonese classes taught by seniors to youths, as well as Senior Superheroes where seniors impart practical knowledge and skills including shopping at wet markets and cooking to youths;(c) NYC supports youth-led initiatives such as Interlogue aimed at strengthening relationships between grandparents and children through a museum programme involving conversation starter kits and activities.(d) Our Singapore Fund has also supported ground-up initiatives by groups such as the Cassia Resettlement Team, Empower Aging and ACE Seniors, which bring different generations of Singaporeans together to serve the community.It will be increasingly important for different generations of Singaporeans to work together to overcome our challenges – such as the ones brought to the fore by the pandemic – and to seize the opportunities ahead of us. This ability to work together, empathise with the experiences of different generations, and recognise each others’ strengths, will also make us a more competitive workforce as our workplaces will better harness the energies of a more diverse profile of employees.Therefore, MCCY will continue to work with other agencies to provide more platforms for Singaporeans of all ages to work together. However, fostering inter-generational collaboration is not something the Government can do alone. It ultimately requires all Singaporeans, young and old, to make the effort to listen and build relationships with one another. We encourage Singaporeans of all generations to step forward to be part of our democracy of deeds, and to work together to gift a stronger, better Singapore for future generations."
"efforts and upcoming plans to engage youths on views, concerns and aspirations for a post-covid-19 world","Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth what are the efforts and upcoming plans by the Government to engage youths during this pandemic so that their views, concerns and aspirations can be taken into account as Singapore plans for a post-COVID-19 world.","Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai: MCCY and the National Youth Council (NYC) have been engaging our youths during the COVID-19 period, through our digital platforms, to better understand and respond to their sentiments and concerns. During this period, our youths have been concerned about job prospect, finances, and their mental well-being. In response, NYC partnered youth sector organisations to create digital content and resources to help youths cope with the COVID-19 situation. For example, videos, articles and infographics addressing these concerns were published on Youth.sg. NYC also partnered CR8 Studio SG, a digital video channel that hired creative freelancers affected by COVID-19, to develop content to engage youths during the Circuit Breaker.Our youths also care about how COVID-19 has impacted our wider society, such as vulnerable groups. They see an opportunity to restate what Singapore stands for, and re-shape our society to be more inclusive, and sustainable. Many have stepped forward to organise or participate in initiatives to help vulnerable groups, and re-create social connections during this time when it is difficult to gather as we would usually do pre-COVID.Government and the National Youth Council will continue to enable and partner our youth, to address their concerns and also their aspirations to contribute during this time. These platforms include:(i) Youth Action Challenge (YAC), where youths can come up with innovative solutions on issues they care about, supported with funding and mentorship. The first run of YAC, held in September 2019 involved about 250 youths forming teams and pitching 57 project ideas to a panel of judges. The second run of the YAC will start this October, with a focus on COVID-19;(ii) Young ChangeMakers, a platform for youths to pitch ideas that benefit the community and receive grants to implement their ideas. NYC has made it easier and faster for Covid-19 related projects to access grants; and(iii) Youth Corps Singapore, where youths can volunteer for community activities in areas such as mental health, vulnerable groups and environment. COVID-19 has certainly not limited our youths’ perspectives or ambitions for our country. We have heard their views as part of an ongoing journey that started with the Youth Conversations in 2018, followed by the SG Youth Action Plan, and we will further build on these through the ongoing SG Together Emerging Stronger Conversations. Our youths will have more opportunities to discuss national issues and policies, and be part of the implementation plans, so that Singapore society can emerge stronger from COVID-19."
number and trend of cases of thefts and vandalism of community gardens in last five years and measures and public education programmes in place,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development (a) how many cases of thefts and vandalism of community gardens have been reported in the last five years, (b) whether there has been a rising trend; (c) whether there are measures to make it easier for the gardeners to make reports; and (d) what measures and public education programmes are in place to deter and reduce these crimes.","Mr Desmond Lee: NParks has only received infrequent feedback on theft and vandalism in community gardens over the last five years. As community gardens are shared gardening spaces set up and managed by the community, gardeners have the option of reporting such incidents to their Residents’ Committee (for public estates) or Neighbourhood Committee (for private estates), or making a police report.To allow both gardeners and other residents to enjoy community gardens respectfully and amicably, some community gardens have signs to encourage residents to contact the gardeners should they wish to request for plants or their harvest. Some community gardeners also work with the People’s Association to install community refrigerators, to allow gardeners to freely share excess harvests with other residents.NParks also encourages community gardeners to hold regular outreach events to allow other residents to appreciate the efforts and hard work that goes into these spaces, and to build stronger relationships within the community. Such events include garden open houses, gatherings to share harvests, and gatherings to grow common edible plants for the community to freely harvest. By working together, community gardening groups can ensure that their gardens continue to serve as shared spaces that beautify and add vibrancy to our neighbourhoods."
local species of flora and fauna classified as extinct and endangered and efforts to raise students and young singaporeans' awareness of biodiversity conservation issues,Dr Tan Wu Meng asked the Minister for National Development (a) how many local species of flora and fauna have become extinct in the last five years; (b) how many local species are currently endangered; and (c) what efforts are being made to improve students and young Singaporeans' awareness of biodiversity and the risks and consequences of species extinction.,"Mr Desmond Lee: There are an estimated 35,000 to 45,000 species of flora and fauna native to Singapore. No species of flora or fauna native to Singapore has been classified as presumed nationally extinct in the last five years. 857 species of native flora and fauna are currently classified as critically endangered, while 352 species are classified as endangered.Youth engagement is a key component of NParks’ biodiversity conservation efforts. NParks conducts programmes for students and young Singaporeans to raise awareness of biodiversity conservation issues, and to encourage them to participate in nature conservation-related projects. This includes the Greening Schools for Biodiversity programme, which equips students with the necessary knowledge and skills to carry out habitat enhancement within their campus. There is also the Biodiversity Friends Forum programme, which nurtures young Singaporeans to become future leaders in biodiversity conservation. In addition, NParks involves young Singaporeans in its biodiversity surveys.NParks will continue to find new ways to improve awareness by involving students and young Singaporeans in biodiversity conservation efforts, as we transform into a City in Nature."
number of requests for assistance with rent payments under hdb public rental scheme and plans to consider temporary rent freeze,"Ms He Ting Ru asked the Minister for National Development (a) under the HDB Public Rental Scheme, how many requests for assistance with rent payments has been received so far for this year; and (b) whether HDB is considering a temporary rent freeze for tenants.","Mr Desmond Lee: HDB will help public rental households who need assistance with rent payments. From January to July 2020, HDB received an average of 370 requests per month for rent assistance. Over the same period, 325 households per month had their rents reduced. The reduced rent will apply for the rest of each household’s current tenancy term (up to three years). There were also 1,470 households per month emplaced on or renewed for ComCare rent assistance.Public rental rates are highly subsidised. Rents are never raised within a tenancy term, but can be lowered at any time if the household income falls. Rents are reviewed only at tenancy renewal, which happens every two to three years. Any tenants having difficulty affording their rent should approach their local HDB Branch for assistance. We will continue to monitor the situation, and ensure that public rental households in need will get the assistance that they require."
employment rate and redundancy rate of jobs support scheme recipient firms in march 2020 versus currently,"Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the employment rate for Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) recipient firms in March 2020 versus currently; (b) whether the redundancy rate of the JSS recipient firms has increased and, if so, by how much; and (c) what is the unemployment or redundancy rate among firms that are recipients of JSS versus those that have declined the JSS payouts.","Mrs Josephine Teo: Employment rate is measured at the population level, and not at the firm level.JSS support has been tiered by the estimated impact of COVID-19 on different sectors. To date, over 150,000 employers have received JSS payouts. Of these, nearly 600 employers have declined or returned their JSS payouts. It stands to reason that these 600 employers have been less severely impacted by the COVID-19 situation, with less need to trim their workforce. The data on their employment reflects this.Between March 2020 and June 2020, resident employment fell by an estimated 2.7% in firms that received Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) payouts, compared with 0.6% increase in firms that declined JSS payouts.Data on retrenchment is based on private sector establishments with at least 25 employees. In 2Q 2020, the retrenchment rate among resident employees in firms that received JSS payouts is estimated to be 3.1 per 1,000, compared to 1.8 per 1,000 in firms that declined JSS payouts."
number of adult singaporeans not having a bank account and reasons for not having one,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis asked the Prime Minister (a) how many adult Singaporeans currently do not have a bank account; (b) what are the primary reasons for individuals not having a bank account; and (c) whether special bank accounts for Government transactions can be created through POSB for such individuals.,"Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): It is estimated that over 98% of adult Singapore residents have bank accounts. In the recent Solidarity Payment payout, 98.7% of Singaporeans who received the payments had the amounts credited into their bank accounts. As for the remaining recipients, surveys showed that many also had bank accounts but preferred to collect the payouts in cash.  Notwithstanding this high level of banking access, to ensure that Singaporeans have access to affordable and convenient basic banking services, the three local banks, Citibank, HSBC, Maybank and Standard Chartered Bank already offer Basic Banking Accounts (BBAs) since 2002. Typically, such accounts come with ATM/debit card, internet banking and electronic payment services, and can be maintained at very low or even no cost. For instance, DBS/POSB does not set any initial deposit or minimum account balance and waives the $2 maintenance fee if the individual chooses to receive eStatements. The local banks also waive fall-below fees for specific customer segments such as children, the elderly and recipients of public assistance.However, some Singaporeans remain unbanked. This may be due to low awareness of the availability of BBAs, or by choice. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has made clear its expectation that banks should provide accounts to individuals who want them. In some cases, where specific safeguards may be required to mitigate money laundering or terrorism financing risks, banks may offer accounts with more limited functionalities. There is a small number of individuals who have committed serious crimes related to sanctions imposed by the United Nations1 who may not be able to open bank accounts. Banks have significant concerns in such cases, due to the difficulty of confirming the source of the customers’ funds or the legitimacy of transactions. MAS has been working with the banks to allow accounts to be opened for such individuals with enhanced due diligence and account restrictions. MAS is working with banks on further ways to enhance financial inclusion, while ensuring that risks are adequately managed. It is collaborating with the Ministry of Education, to ensure that all Singaporean children have bank accounts."
develop responsible financing policies to address climate risks posed by high climate-risk sectors,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Prime Minister (a) what policies is MAS studying to address climate risks posed by the high climate-risk sectors that have been identified in the Guidelines to Responsible Financing Practices published by the Association of Banks in Singapore in 2018; and (b) whether the Ministry can share how the MAS will be working with banks to develop their responsible financing policies in relation to these high climate-risk sectors.,"Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): The Monetary Authority of Singapore's (MAS) objective is to ensure that financial institutions manage their climate-related risks well, and support our economy's transition to a sustainable and low carbon future. To do so, MAS is issuing new supervisory guidance that incorporates best practices on environmental risk management developed by global regulators, including at the Network for Greening the Financial System. MAS' proposed Guidelines on Environmental Risk Management1, which has undergone public consultation, will be finalised in Q4 2020. It will set out clear expectations for banks to implement environmentally responsible financing policies and practices, and includes:(a) Boards and senior management should maintain effective oversight of banks' management of environmental risk and address material environmental risk in their risk appetite framework;(b) For sectors that pose higher environmental risk, develop sector-specific policies, setting out banks' expectations on customers, taking into account relevant sustainability standards and certification schemes. Banks should also engage these customers to support their transition towards sustainable business practices over time; and(c) Disclose their approaches to managing environmental risk, and the impact of environmental risk on their financial performance, including quantitative metrics such as exposures to sectors with higher environmental risk. This will enable investors to better assess the banks' environmental risk exposures.Our approach is therefore not to outrightly disallow financial institutions from serving industries that are subject to climate-related risks at this stage. Instead, MAS expects financial institutions to assess their exposures to these industries, mitigate risks, work with each higher-risk customer to improve its environmental risk profile, and ensure there is senior level oversight on these issues. This approach strikes a better balance between supporting sustainable development, and recognising that many of these industries still play a role in the broader economic and social development needs of the region.MAS is engaging the banks on how they intend to implement the Guidelines. We are collaborating with fellow regulators to develop climate risk measurement methodologies and metrics. We will also continue to promote the best practices among banks on environmental risk analysis and management."
data on retiree landlords dependent on rental incomes of their commercial units and further grants to cover them beyond rental relief framework,Ms Ng Ling Ling asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) whether the Ministry has data on retiree landlords who are dependent on rental incomes of their small commercial units for their monthly living expenses; and (b) whether there are further grants that can cover them under the Rental Relief Framework for SMEs beyond the one-month waiver on grounds of financial hardship.,"Mr Heng Swee Keat: The Rental Relief Framework provides for the Government, landlords and SME tenants to share in the rental obligations of SME businesses during this difficult period. This framework recognises that landlords, in partnership with the Government, have a shared interest in helping their SME tenants survive and succeed.In designing the Framework, the Ministry of Law had carefully considered and consulted a range of stakeholders on the potential impact on landlords. Landlords who meet the criteria for financial hardship may apply to halve their rental waiver obligations under the Additional Rental Relief component. Based on our records, about 3,000 landlords may qualify for a reduction in obligations under the financial hardship criteria1. Of these, more than 65% are aged 62 and above. As at 30 August 2020, the Registry of Rental Relief Assessors has received about 455 applications, and we expect more in the coming months.Individual and SME landlords facing cash flow difficulties can also apply to banks and finance companies to defer principal payments on their mortgages up to 31 December 2020 and to extend the loan tenure by up to the corresponding deferment period. Individual landlords who are required to provide relief to their tenants can also apply to defer interest payments, in addition to principal payments, on their mortgages up to 31 December 2020, and to extend the loan tenure by up to the corresponding deferment period.The provisions to help landlords in financial hardship strike a balance between the needs of landlords and tenants. The Government will continue to monitor the situation closely and make adjustments as necessary."
"breakdown of number of applications received to extend social visit pass, long term visit pass or long term pass plus of foreign spouses of singaporean","Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) how many applications has ICA received to extend the social visit pass, Long Term Visit Pass (LTVP) or Long Term Visit Pass Plus (LTVP+) of foreign spouses of Singaporeans (i) between February and July 2019 and (ii) between February and July 2020, with a breakdown by social visit pass, LTVP and LTVP+; (b) what are the success rates for each category; and (c) what are the most frequent reasons for rejection.","Mr K Shanmugam: From February to July in 2019 and 2020, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) received 6,419 and 8,395 applications respectively for extension of Short-Term Visit Pass (STVP) from foreign spouses of Singaporeans. 2.6% and 2.8% respectively were rejected. From February to July in 2019 and 2020, ICA received 4,503 and 4,243 applications respectively for renewal of Long-Term Visit Pass (LTVP) from foreign spouses of Singaporeans. In both years, about 0.4% of applications were rejected. Over the same period, ICA received 987 and 1,554 applications respectively for renewal of Long-Term Visit Pass Plus (LTVP+) from foreign spouses of Singaporeans. 0.9% and 0.5% respectively were rejected. Applications for STVP, LTVP and LTVP+ are considered holistically and there may be a number of reasons why a pass is not extended or renewed. STVP extension applications are rejected mostly because the sponsor or applicant was found to have adverse records, or the applicant was unable to substantiate the need for further extensions. For LTVP or LTVP+ renewal applications, reasons for rejection were mostly because the sponsor or the applicant was found to have adverse records, or was not able to demonstrate the ability to support the family financially.To assist those with genuine difficulties during the current COVID-19 situation, ICA considers additional factors, such as the prevailing travel restrictions and flight connectivity, when assessing the extension or renewal of passes."
number of banks with qualifying full banking licences currently granting loans to local corporations with turnovers below $10 million,Mr Don Wee asked the Prime Minister how many banks with Qualifying Full Banking Licences currently grant loans to local corporations with turnovers below S$10 million.,"Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Singapore are served by a variety of lending institutions and platforms in our financial sector. The three local banks, finance companies and, more recently, crowdfunding platforms, play an active role lending to SMEs and the smaller local enterprises with annual turnover below $10 million. Mr Wee asked specifically about Qualifying Full Banks (QFBs). Five of the nine QFBs1 currently grant loans to SMEs and local enterprises with annual turnover below $10 million. The remaining QFBs serve other segments of the Singapore market, providing services such as retail banking, wealth management, Renminbi services, securities services, and credit and trade finance for larger corporates.The Government has provided a 90% risk-share on the loans granted under Enterprise Singapore's (ESG) Temporary Bridging Loan Programme, which has increased the availability of credit to SMEs. More than 80% of these loans were taken up by local enterprises with annual turnover below $10 million."
"take-up and split of loan capital smes and large firms, interest rates paid by banks and expected repayment period for banks","Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) to date, how many companies have taken up loans that are backed by the $22 billion loan capital set aside as part of the Government's COVID-19 package; (b) what is the split of loan capital taken up by SMEs and large firms; (c) what is the interest rate that is paid by the banks for tapping on this loan capital; and (d) what is the expected repayment period for banks tapping on the loan capital that is set aside.","Mr Heng Swee Keat: To help enterprises with credit and cash flow, the Government introduced and enhanced financing schemes, such as the Temporary Bridging Loan Programme (TBLP), as part of the COVID-19 support packages. The TBLP has supported $13.1 billion of loans and 16,349 companies as of 31 August 2020. 99.7% of these companies are SMEs, and 0.3% of them are larger firms.Under the TBLP, Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) can choose to tap on their own capital, Government's loan capital or the MAS SGD Facility for ESG Loans when issuing loans. For Government's loan capital, there is an interest rate of 1.9% per annum (p.a.) without collateral. The repayment period, for a PFI which borrows from the Government, is tied to the tenure of the loans offered by the PFI, i.e. up to five years. The MAS SGD Facility for ESG Loans provides funds to PFIs at 0.1% p.a. for up to two years, and requires PFIs to provide collateral.For now, most of the loans supported under the TBLP are drawing capital from the MAS SGD Facility. Overall, we have lowered the interest rates charged by PFIs to borrowers for TBLP loans to a range of 1.5% to 3.0% p.a.  "
review of personal income tax reliefs vis-a-vis dependant's income threshold and child's ns allowances since 2010,"Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance whether he will review the personal income tax reliefs in relation to a dependant's income threshold of $4,000 and the child's full-time national serviceman allowances that has increased since 2010.","Mr Heng Swee Keat: Tax reliefs such as Parent Relief, Spouse Relief and Qualifying Child Relief are given to taxpayers to recognise their efforts in supporting their family members.These reliefs are intended for circumstances where the dependent is handicapped, or is not earning any income. Nevertheless, we recognise that some dependants may derive a small amount of incidental income. Hence our approach caters for that by setting the dependant's income threshold at $4,000 a year. This income condition applies to all dependants, including parents, spouses, and children. We will continue to review our personal income tax system to ensure continued relevance and effectiveness."
number of cases of neighbour disputes arising from second-hand cigarette smoke mediated successfully in past two years,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Law in each of the past two years (a) how many cases of neighbour disputes arising from second-hand cigarette smoke have been mediated successfully by HDB; (b) how many cases have proceeded to the Community Mediation Centre and mediated successfully; (c) how many cases are filed with the Community Disputes Resolutions Tribunals; and (d) what is the extent of increase or decrease in the number of such cases after the start of the circuit breaker period.,"Mr K Shanmugam: In a densely populated state such as Singapore, disagreements between neighbours may arise. These include instances where second-hand cigarette smoke from one neighbour affects another. In some cases, neighbours are able to discuss such issues directly and resolve them amicably. Finding mutually acceptable solutions in this way strengthens neighbourly relations in the long run. In instances where neighbours are unable to resolve the dispute themselves, the Government has created avenues to help neighbours work out their disagreements. While Housing and Development Board (HDB) officers do not themselves conduct mediation, the Community Mediation Centre (CMC) provides trained, neutral, mediators who can help neighbours arrive at mutually acceptable solutions. Mediation at the CMC is generally voluntary.  Between January 2019 and July 2020, 71 cases concerning second-hand cigarette smoke were registered with the CMC. During and after the circuit breaker, there was an increase in the number of disputes over cigarette smoke registered with the CMC, up from an average of two cases before, to eight cases monthly. 70 out of the 71 cases registered were voluntary. To date, nine cases have proceeded to mediation. Six of these cases were successful. About two-thirds of the 71 cases did not proceed to mediation because one party either declined mediation or did not respond.As mediation is generally voluntary, it has its limitations. As can be seen, despite the relatively high success rate of CMC mediations, the take up rate remains low. In some cases, parties may presume that the relationship has deteriorated so much that there is no point attempting to negotiate. Mediators also cannot make binding decisions; they can only help parties reach a mutual agreement. Some parties believe that it is better to skip mediation and go straight to the courts, in order to obtain a permanent, binding order, in their favour. The Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals (CDRT) was established in 2015 as an avenue of last resort. A CDRT judge can require parties to attend mediation. If mediation is not successful, the dispute can also be litigated before the CDRT. Between January 2019 and July 2020, 25 claims relating to excessive smoke, caused by activities such as the burning of incense and cigarette smoking, were filed at the CDRT. There was no discernible shift in the number of claims filed with the CDRT during and after the circuit breaker.The Government is mindful that even with the CMC and CDRT in place, there continues to be difficult cases that are not resolved and differences not reconciled.  It has been about five years since the community dispute resolution framework was launched. It is timely to review how we can strengthen it and make it more effective."
plans to join covid-19 vaccine trials and developing a framework for administering covid-19 vaccine when adopted,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Health (a) whether Singapore will be joining trials for COVID-19 vaccines developed by other nations and, if so, when will these trials commence; (b) whether there are plans to purchase vaccines currently under clinical trial around the world; and (c) whether a framework has been developed for the manner of administration of a COVID-19 vaccine in Singapore once one has been adopted.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Government is closely monitoring the global progress in the development of COVID-19 vaccines, and taking active steps to ensure that Singapore has timely access to an effective and safe vaccine when this becomes available. Duke-NUS Medical School is collaborating with a United States biotechnology company, Arcturus Therapeutics, to co-develop a COVID-19 vaccine. The school supported the pre-clinical studies by conducting rapid screening of potential vaccine candidates for effectiveness and safety, and by conducting animal trials. Phase 1 human clinical trials for this vaccine started in early August at the SingHealth Investigational Medicine Unit (IMU). Singapore is also participating in the discussions led by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on the multi-country Solidarity Vaccine Trials.Singapore is actively pursuing the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines with a number of pharmaceutical companies, while keeping abreast of the progress of the various vaccine candidates under development. These discussions are covered by confidentiality obligations and we will not be able to provide more information at this point in time. We are also actively engaged in international discussions, such as with the WHO, CEPI and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (Gavi), as well as like-minded countries to look into early, fair and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines through the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX) Facility. MOH is working on plans for the administration of a COVID-19 vaccine when it is assessed to be safe and effective for use, and has received the appropriate approvals by the Health Sciences Authority. This will take into consideration the characteristics of the vaccine, suitability for different population subgroups, and availability of the supply and other factors. Our priority is to protect individuals who are most vulnerable or at high risk from the disease, as well as those who may be more likely exposed to infection, while working progressively towards a high level of vaccination in the population. We will need to refine and adapt our vaccination strategy as more clinical data from the various vaccine candidates become available in the coming months. "
plans to increase awareness among merchants who adopt cashless payments on payment verification and possible scams,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Communications and Information whether the Ministry will increase awareness among merchants who adopt cashless payments on how to verify payments and what they can do to protect themselves from possible scams.,"Mr S Iswaran: In recent years, the Government has made a concerted push to drive the adoption of cashless payment solutions by merchants.  We have made significant strides in developing a single, interoperable e-payment solution which unifies different payment schemes under a single Singapore Quick Response (SGQR) label, making it easy, convenient and secure for users. There are understandable concerns about fraud, errors and security threats behind cashless payment solutions, among merchants as well as consumers. Beyond existing verification measures and safeguards within payment systems, merchants and consumers are encouraged to exercise vigilance to combat such scams, keep devices secure with the latest security patches, and maintain their password secrecy.  Recently, concerns were raised that merchants unfamiliar with cashless payments may face greater risk of payment scams. In June 2020, IMDA launched the Hawkers Go Digital programme, as part of a nationwide effort to help micro-enterprises like stallholders at NEA hawker centres, HDB coffeeshops and wet markets and JTC industrial canteens, to accelerate the adoption of the unified SGQR solution. We also established the SG Digital Office (SDO), mobilising 1,000 Digital Ambassadors to work together with NETS to engage and guide stallholders. Along with the deployment of the SGQR code, NETS will also help stallholders install the NETSBiz App on their digital device and teach them how to verify successful payment transactions in real-time. This App provides real-time notifications of successful payment transactions in English or Mandarin, has a voice notification capability in English and Mandarin, and allows stallholders to view their transaction histories. Stallholders may also approach NETS personnel or SDO's Digital Ambassadors on the ground should they need further assistance. "
resources for detection of mental health issues and provision of preventive care and subsidies available,"Ms Ng Ling Ling asked the Minister for Health (a) how are the primary care providers, including polyclinics and private GP clinics, equipped and resourced to detect early onset of mental health issues and to provide preventive care; (b) what are the subsidies for Singaporeans in seeking such preventive care; and (c) whether there are integration platforms with social services in such care provisions.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Under the Community Mental Health Masterplan (CMHMP), primary care providers receive support to improve early identification and access to mental health care for persons with mental health issues. Mental health services have been set up in the polyclinics. Family physicians, nurses, psychologists and medical social workers sited at these polyclinics are trained to recognise early signs of mental distress among patients so that they can provide timely mental health assessment and intervention. In addition, over 220 general practitioners (GP) have been trained under the Mental Health General Practitioner Partnership Programme (MHGPP) to identify, diagnose and manage persons with mental health issues in the community. Government subsidies are available at polyclinics and Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) subsidies are available at CHAS GPs for Singaporeans who seek treatment for mental health issues in the primary care setting. In November 2019, CHAS Green was introduced to allow all chronic patients, regardless of income, to enjoy CHAS subsidies for mental illnesses under the Chronic Disease Management Programme (CDMP) (namely major depression, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia) at CHAS GPs clinics. Currently, patients can also withdraw up to $500 per year from their MediSave for the outpatient management of conditions under the CDMP. For patients with complex chronic conditions, this annual withdrawal limit will be raised to $700 from 1 January 2021. Lastly, those aged 60 and above may tap on Flexi-MediSave. In addition to providing accessible and affordable care for persons with mental health condition(s), the Agency of Integrated Care (AIC) helps to coordinate care across the health and social sectors for persons with mental health issues. Primary care providers, community partners, ground agencies and members of the public can refer persons with/suspected to have mental health condition(s) to AIC, who will then work with relevant stakeholders to support clients with the appropriate medical and social services.  "
consideration to allow private security firms to recruit and employ singporeans aged above 60 on a temporary basis as private security officers,"Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether the Singapore Police Force will allow private security firms to recruit and employ Singaporeans on a temporary basis for specified tasks as private security officers pending their (i) screening, training and passing the requisite tests and (ii) pending their medical screening for those aged above 60 years.","Mr K Shanmugam: Under the Private Security Industry Act (PSIA), a person must be licensed before carrying out the functions of a security officer. Security screening is part of the licensing procedures. This reduces the risk that persons abuse their positions as security officers to commit crimes against their clients or the public. Security officers perform duties such as patrol, access control, and responding to incidents. They need to be properly trained and qualified, so that they can perform these important duties effectively. The process of licence application and training can be done concurrently. A person can obtain his licence and complete the requisite training in about two weeks if he meets the security screening and course requirements. It is also a licensing condition that security officers above the age of 60 be certified medically fit for duty before being deployed. This is for their own welfare and safety, as the job of a security officer is physically demanding. In short, there are important reasons for these requirements. The Police can allow security agencies to deploy as security officers, only persons who have been security cleared and are properly qualified."
extending availability of medication delivery to patients' home for patients collecting routine medication for chronic conditions,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry will consider more widespread availability of medication delivery to patients' homes to reduce crowding and waiting time in polyclinics and hospitals especially for those patients collecting routine medication for chronic conditions.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Public healthcare institutions have been providing medication delivery services since 2003 to bring greater convenience to patients. The Agency for Logistics Procurement and Supply (ALPS) set up by the Ministry of Health, has partnered public healthcare institutions and worked with various providers to enhance the service quality and affordability of medication delivery services. With the ongoing COVID-19 situation, delivery capacity has increased tenfold from 320 deliveries per day before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic to an average of 3,200 deliveries each day. There were over 400,000 medication deliveries made from 1 February to 25 August 2020. In addition to medicine delivery services, selected polyclinics also provide the option for patients to collect their medicine at their convenience from Pilbox lockers, selected parcel deposit lockers or certain retail pharmacy outlets. Patients may approach the pharmacy staff at the public healthcare institutions to arrange for medication delivery or collection."
number of visitors and their family members allowed into singapore for medical treatment since 27 march 2020,"Ms He Ting Ru asked the Minister for Health (a) since 27 March 2020, how many visitors have been allowed into Singapore for medical treatment; (b) how many of their family members have been permitted to enter Singapore; and (c) what is the breakdown of the countries that these visitors come from.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: For the five months since 27 March 2020, 303 foreign patients on short-term visitor pass and 260 accompanying caregivers have been approved to enter Singapore for medical treatment. Of these, 183 foreign patients had entered Singapore and 147 brought along a caregiver.These are mostly existing patients cared for by medical specialists in Singapore who need active follow up, such as cancer patients on chemotherapy and patients with renal diseases who require continuing care. Approved patients can bring along one accompanying caregiver if required. Foreign patients and accompanying caregivers need to test negative for COVID-19 in their home countries before departure. They will be tested again on arrival in Singapore and are subjected to the prevailing Stay-Home-Notice requirements.The majority of foreign patients are from Indonesia, followed by Vietnam, Malaysia, Bangladesh and the Philippines. "
response to us clean network initiative while maintaining access to technologies from different providers,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) how does the Government intend to respond to the US Clean Network Initiative while maintaining access to technologies from different providers; and (b) how does the Government intend to mitigate consequences or repercussions from any non-compliance with this initiative.,"Mr S Iswaran: Singapore aims to leverage on the opportunities and benefits of digital technologies, while keeping our communications infrastructure and computer networks secure and resilient. The Government is committed to working with partners, including overseas government counterparts, and technology and service providers in both bilateral and multilateral settings, to ensure that our infrastructure is reliable, safe and world-class. We closely monitor all initiatives, including the US Clean Networks programme. Our regulatory and security agencies will continue to work with trusted partners and in relevant multilateral platforms to enhance the security, diversity and resilience of our network systems."
total number of imported covid-19 cases who are non-singaporeans and top three countries of embarkation of these cases,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Health (a) Between April and August 2020, what is the total number of imported COVID-19 cases who are non-Singapore citizens; and (b) of these cases, what are the top three countries of embarkation from where these persons came from and what are the respective figures for each of these countries.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: For the five months between 1 April 2020 to 31 August 2020, Singapore has seen a total of 292 imported COVID-19 cases who are non-Singaporeans. Of these, there were 56 Permanent Residents, 110 Work Pass holders, 99 Long-Term Visit and 27 Short-Term Visit Pass holders. Their top three countries of last embarkation were India with 183 imported cases; the Philippines with 46 imported cases; and Indonesia with 15 imported cases."
bursary applications received by autonomous universities and percentage rejected in past five years,"Ms Raeesah Khan asked the Minister for Education (a) in the past five years, how many applications that local autonomous universities have received for the Higher Education Community Bursary and the Higher Education Bursary from full-time and part-time undergraduates; and (b) what is the percentage of rejected applications.","Mr Lawrence Wong: The number of Government bursaries awarded to Singaporean full-time undergraduates and part-time undergraduates from Academic Year (AY) 2015 to AY2019 is shown below. The numbers have increased due to better outreach by the universities and the expanding undergraduate enrolment.The Government bursaries are available to Singaporean students who meet the income criterion – either gross household income of not more than $9,000, or per capita household income of not more than $2,250. This is estimated to cover up to the 66th percentile of households by household income. All Singaporean students who meet the eligibility criteria will be awarded the bursary, and we do not track the number of rejected applications."
expanding green lane for business travel to china without sponsors,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether the Ministry will consider expanding the Green Lane to allow for business travel to China without sponsors so that small businesses may continue travelling for business to China.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: The Singapore-China Fast Lane was launched on 8 June 2020 to facilitate essential cross-border travel between Singapore and six Chinese provinces and municipalities1. It was Singapore's first fast lane arrangement with a foreign partner, and China's first with a Southeast Asian country.The Singapore Government has received feedback from the Singapore business community on the challenges our businesses face in obtaining approval from the Chinese authorities for Fast Lane travel to China. These include difficulties in securing Fast Lane Letters of Invitation (LOI)2, the restrictions under a controlled itinerary, and being subjected to a 14-day quarantine by some local authorities. Requirements such as the need for a controlled itinerary supervised by a sponsoring local government agency or host company are integral to the Fast Lane. They are intended to minimise the exposure of such Fast Lane travellers to the broader community, in lieu of a quarantine period. This applies to Fast Lane users of both Singapore and China.  MTI, together with MFA, has conveyed the feedback from our business community to the relevant Chinese authorities. We will continue working with the Chinese authorities to improve the Fast Lane to bring greater benefit to the business communities of both countries."
statistics on reported cyberbullying cases in primary and secondary schools in last three years and measures to protect children against cyberbullying,"Mr Shawn Huang Wei Zhong asked the Minister for Education (a) over the last three years, what is the number of cases of cyberbullying reported in primary and secondary schools respectively; (b) whether there are established guidelines of corrective actions to be taken against the perpetrators; and (c) whether the Ministry has plans to further develop cybersecurity infrastructure and legal frameworks to protect children against cyberbullying.","Mr Lawrence Wong: MOE and schools take a serious view of all bullying incidents, including cyberbullying. Schools put in place school rules and ICT policies to create safe and supportive learning environments, both physical and online. Through the Cyber Wellness lessons, students are taught to protect themselves online, as well as help their peers who have been bullied. The number of reported cyberbullying incidents remains low and stable over the past three years. When cyberbullying incidents occur, our primary approach is to help students learn from their mistakes, restore relationships and refrain from future occurrences. When the cases are reported, they are promptly investigated, and appropriate disciplinary action is taken to guide perpetrators and restore relationships with those whom they have hurt. Counselling support is also provided to victims and perpetrators. Referrals may be made to Response, Early Intervention and Assessment in Community mental Health (REACH) as well as social and community agencies for specialised support. Schools are also supported by ICT infrastructure with technologies such as network filtering of inappropriate content, network security and endpoint protection. Best practices in classroom management to encourage proper behaviours as well as security protocol against cybersecurity threats such as hijacking of online live lessons, phishing and ransomware are shared with schools. There are also resources available for parents, such as information on parental control and monitoring of students’ device usage to reduce the exposure to cyber risks."
incentivising use of environment-friendly food and drink containers,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether the Ministry will consider incentivising the use of environment-friendly food and drink containers such as washable or reusable containers.,"Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: My Ministry and the National Environment Agency (NEA) have been actively promoting the use of reusable containers in place of disposables. For example, NEA has disallowed the use of disposables for dine-in meals at all its new hawker centres and for cooked food stallholders who started their tenancies in any hawker centre from September 2018. Through the nation-wide ""Say YES to Waste Less"" campaign launched in 2019, operators of over 1,600 premises have partnered NEA to encourage consumers to bring along reusables and decline disposables when ordering food for takeaway or delivery. Under this campaign, many Food & Beverage establishments have taken the lead to incentivise consumers who bring reusable containers. For example, Starbucks offers a $0.50 discount to customers who bring their own cups or tumblers, and SaladStop! offers a free topping for customers who bring their own bowls for takeaway orders. We are heartened by the initiatives and commitment of the private sector and encourage more companies to join in this effort.Addressing the excessive consumption of disposables remains a priority of my Ministry and NEA. A Citizens' Workgroup to look into measures to check the excessive consumption of disposables will be convened this month. We look forward to hearing their ideas on how we can encourage everyone to play his or her part to reduce the use of disposables, including incentivising the use of environment-friendly food and drink containers."
statistics and outcome of applications for covid-19 support grant,"Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) to date, what has been the total number of applications for the COVID-19 Support Grant; (b) what is the number of successful applications; (c) what is the breakdown of rejected applications based on eligibility criteria; and (d) of the rejected cases, what is the number of cases that are successful upon appeal or re-application.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The COVID-19 Support Grant (CSG) supports lower- to middle-income resident employees who, as a result of the economic impact of COVID-19, are presently i) Involuntarily unemployed due to retrenchment or contract termination; ii) Placed on involuntary no-pay leave for at least three consecutive months; or iii) Experiencing reduced monthly salary of at least 30% for at least three consecutive months. As at 16 August 2020, around 115,000 individuals had applied for the CSG. Of these, MSF approved the CSG for around 65,000 recipients. About 41,000 applicants were unsuccessful, and around 9,000 applications were still being processed. The unsuccessful CSG applications were mainly due to applicants not meeting the eligibility criteria for salary loss, job loss, or no-pay leave, or were not employees. This accounted for almost three quarters of unsuccessful applications. Other reasons included employment details not being verifiable, and the Annual Property Value and household income criteria not being met.As at 16 August 2020, MSF had received around 8,000 appeals for the CSG. Around 7,500 of these appeals were approved. When considering these appeals, MSF would have taken into account any special circumstances that would warrant special consideration for individual cases."
cost of living during covid-19 and measures to monitor and manage situation,"Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) whether the cost of living has increased during the current COVID-19 period; and (b) if so, what measures are being taken to monitor and manage the situation.","Mr Chan Chun Sing: Between January 2020 when the first local COVID-19 case was confirmed and July 2020, the Consumer Price Index-All Items1 declined by 0.2 per cent on a year-on-year basis. This decline was largely driven by a fall in the cost of pre-primary education, electricity, outpatient services and petrol, which outweighed an increase in food prices.Nonetheless, the Government recognises that cost of living may remain a cause for concern for Singaporeans, especially those who have suffered employment losses or wage cuts during the current economic downturn. To help Singaporeans tide over this difficult period, the Government has rolled out several support measures, including the Care and Support Package, COVID-19 Support Grant, and SG United Jobs and Skills Package. The Government will continue to monitor developments closely, and stands ready to provide more support to Singaporeans if necessary. "
distribution of balance in special needs savings scheme on demise of child,"Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Social and Family Development whether, under the Special Needs Savings Scheme, the Ministry will consider allowing parents of children with special needs to specify to whom the remaining money will be distributed in the unfortunate event of the passing on of the child.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The Special Needs Savings Scheme (SNSS) enables parents to set aside their CPF savings for the long-term care of their children with special needs. Parents can nominate their children with special needs to receive a regular stream of fixed payouts upon the parents' demise. If the SNSS nominee passes on before the parents, the CPF savings originally bequeathed to the SNSS nominee remain in the parents' CPF accounts. If the parents wish to, they can update their CPF nomination to specify how their CPF savings will be distributed upon their demise.However, if the SNSS nominee passes on after the parents, any unused SNSS monies upon the demise of the nominee, will form part of the nominee’s estate, and be distributed either via a will or intestacy laws. Parents who would like to decide how their bequeathed CPF savings will be distributed in the event that their SNSS nominees pass on after them can consider setting up a trust to specify how their bequeathed monies will be used. Parents of SNSS nominees who are assessed to lack mental capacity can also apply to the Court to make a will on their nominees' behalf."
proposal to bring forward schedule for building hawker centre in bukit batok hdb town,Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether the schedule for the building of the hawker centre in Bukit Batok HDB Town by 2027 may be brought forward to deal with the increased number of dwelling units and to stabilise the food and beverage prices in the area.,"Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: My Ministry announced during the Committee of Supply debates in 2019 that the Bukit Batok hawker centre will be co-located with the assisted living residential flats pilot in Bukit Batok Town. The National Environment Agency (NEA) is coordinating with HDB on the timeline of the co-located development. We will announce further details such as the expected date of completion when ready. We will also continue to engage the local adviser on the progress of the centre. Meanwhile, besides the existing coffee shops and other eating establishments already in the area, new coffee shops have also been added by HDB with the completion of new HDB flats in the area, to serve the dining needs of residents."
number of banks involved in administration of government-assisted schemes,Mr Don Wee asked the Minister for Trade and Industry how many banks are currently involved in the administration of Government-assisted schemes such as the Temporary Bridging Loan.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: Enterprise Singapore works with 18 Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) to implement financing schemes such as the Temporary Bridging Loan Programme and the Enterprise Financing Scheme. The PFIs include banks, finance companies, and leasing companies. The full list of the PFIs that administer the various schemes can be found on Enterprise Singapore’s website."
"breakdown of employed and unemployed singaporean, permanent resident and foreign pmets by industries, age and gender","Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Minister for Manpower from January 2010 to June 2020, what is the annual breakdown of Singaporean, permanent resident and foreign Professionals, Managers and Executives in industries such as manufacturing, construction, services, banking and finance, IT and communications, and professional services.","34 Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Minister for Manpower from January 2010 to June 2020, what is the unemployment rate of Singaporeans and Singaporean permanent residents who are Professionals, Managers and Executives by age and gender.Mrs Josephine Teo: A breakdown of Professionals, Managers, Executives & Technicians (PMETs) by industries and residential status, from 2010 to 2019, is provided in Table 1. The unemployment rates of PMETs by residential status, age and sex, from 2010 to 2019, are provided in Table 2. The unemployment rates of Permanent Residents have generally been lower than that of Singapore Citizens. This is to be expected because employability and ability to contribute to our economy are often key considerations of granting Permanent Residency. 2020 data for resident PMETs will be released in the annual report on the Labour Force in Singapore in January 2021."
take-up rate of sg united traineeships across sectors and need to raise awareness,"Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Manpower (a) with the introduction of SG United Traineeships, what is the latest take-up rate across different sectors; (b) whether there is a need to further reach out to more Singaporeans to raise awareness of the Traineeship programme; and (c) whether the Ministry will work with companies to eventually convert a larger proportion of the traineeships into permanent positions post-COVID-19.","Mrs Josephine Teo: Over 1,000 fresh graduate trainees have taken up traineeships under the SGUnited Traineeships programme. The majority of traineeship positions filled are in growth sectors such as Information Communications Technology and Media, Professional Services, and Financial Services. As the process of shortlisting and selecting suitable trainees by host organisations takes time, we can expect to see more placements into traineeships subsequently. We have expanded outreach to increase awareness of these opportunities. To reach out to fresh graduates on opportunities under the SGUnited Traineeships programme, WSG works closely with the Ministry of Education, the Institutes of Higher Learning, the National Trades Union Congress and People’s Association. We also reach out to graduates through various digital media.The traineeships do not automatically convert into a permanent job. However, we are hopeful that companies will find a good number of trainees a good fit and make them part of their permanent staff. This will depend largely on the fit of each trainee to the job, and the business situation and hiring needs of the host organisation when the traineeships are completed. Workforce Singapore’s experience with Attach-and-Train programmes so far has been that host organisations that are impressed with trainees will place them in full-time positions in the companies to make the most of the time and money they have invested in the attachment. The newly-launched Jobs Growth Incentive scheme will give greater support to businesses to expand and grow their local headcounts over the next six months. This will also help spur hiring of trainees.For cases where the traineeship does not result in a permanent job, the experience will equip the trainee with industry-relevant knowledge and skills, and help to burnish their credentials and value proposition to other employers. The Government will also continue to support them in their job search journey, through career matching services offered by WSG and NTUC’s Employability and Employment Institute."
firms under fair consideration framework watchlist,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the current number of firms under the Fair Consideration Framework watchlist; and (b) whether the Ministry will (i) disclose the names of firms that continue to be on the Fair Consideration Framework watchlist for more than six months and (ii) consider withdrawing these firms' access to Government grants and tax incentive schemes.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: There are currently about 400 firms placed on the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF) Watchlist for having a higher share of foreign PMETs compared to their industry peers, or high concentration of a single foreign nationality source. Employment Pass (EP) applications from these firms are held back, while the Tripartite Alliance for Fair & Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) engages these firms to help them improve their human resource practices. Firms on the FCF Watchlist have not flouted any rules but have been identified through proactive surveillance. Measures must therefore be proportional and also consider the impact on their existing local workforce. In most instances, employers on the FCF Watchlist have been responsive to TAFEP’s engagement efforts and expanded their employment of local PMETs. Naming these firms and withdrawing their access to Government grants and tax incentive schemes would likely have frustrated their local hiring efforts and is ultimately counter-productive. Instead, following TAFEP’s intervention, many firms exit the FCF Watchlist within a year. For the minority who are uncooperative, their work pass privileges remain suspended.We plan to proactively engage even more companies under the FCF, such as those whose Singaporean core has been weakening, or whose EP and S Pass workforce are concentrated with a single foreign nationality source. We will work with economic agencies like EDB and MAS to engage these firms to improve their workforce profile. We will also engage the HR community to do more."
plans to study feasibility of introducing sub-spoke bus services,"Mr Don Wee asked the Minister for Transport whether LTA will study the feasibility of introducing sub-spoke bus services that can ply along different routes as compared to the main bus service to better meet the needs of different resident groups connecting to key amenities, such as polyclinics and markets, in the adjacent towns, especially in new estates such as Brickland, without compromising operators' commercial viability.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: LTA regularly reviews the provision of public bus services to ensure that they are within 400 metres of developments, subject to a minimum level of ridership. This approach strikes a balance between providing connectivity while maintaining prudent use of public funds. The developments in Brickland are currently within 400 metres of public bus services and residents are served by Services 172, 983 and 991 to amenities such as the mosque, polyclinic and Teck Whye market. Besides the option of walking about 250 metres to the polyclinic and Teck Whye market, residents can also transfer to Service 307 along Choa Chu Kang Avenue 1. LTA will continue to monitor travel patterns and adjust the provision of bus services where necessary. This can come in the form of additional trips for existing bus services to cater to increased demand in new estates such as Brickland. We are also open to considering sub-spoke services, but these will have to be evaluated carefully as they could lead to increased waiting times, longer travel times and higher fares for some commuters."
employment rate and redundancy rate of jobs support scheme recipient firms in march 2020 versus currently,"Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the employment rate for Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) recipient firms in March 2020 versus currently; (b) whether the redundancy rate of the JSS recipient firms has increased and, if so, by how much; and (c) what is the unemployment or redundancy rate among firms that are recipients of JSS versus those that have declined the JSS payouts.","Mrs Josephine Teo: Employment rate is measured at the population level, and not at the firm level.JSS support has been tiered by the estimated impact of COVID-19 on different sectors. To date, over 150,000 employers have received JSS payouts. Of these, nearly 600 employers have declined or returned their JSS payouts. It stands to reason that these 600 employers have been less severely impacted by the COVID-19 situation, with less need to trim their workforce. The data on their employment reflects this.Between March 2020 and June 2020, resident employment fell by an estimated 2.7% in firms that received Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) payouts, compared with 0.6% increase in firms that declined JSS payouts.Data on retrenchment is based on private sector establishments with at least 25 employees. In 2Q 2020, the retrenchment rate among resident employees in firms that received JSS payouts is estimated to be 3.1 per 1,000, compared to 1.8 per 1,000 in firms that declined JSS payouts."
survey on vulnerable members of society by vulnerable-in-community (vic) network and release of report,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) when will the Vulnerable-In-Community (VIC) Network conduct its planned survey on vulnerable members of society; (b) whether the planned survey will be done periodically; and (c) when will the Ministry release the full survey report to the public.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The Vulnerable-In-Community (VIC) Network, comprising both government and community groups, was set up in November 2019 to reach out to, befriend and extend assistance to vulnerable individuals, such as cardboard collectors or tissue sellers.As part of VIC work, we are planning for a survey to better understand the needs of the individuals we have connected with so that we can provide even more targeted support. We plan to conduct the survey towards the end of the year and will review the survey frequency thereafter.  The survey will likely take a few months to complete. We will release the aggregated survey results when it is ready."
update on feasibility study of implementing noise mitigation measures along pan-island expressway adjacent to hdb blocks in bukit batok smc,Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Transport whether he can provide an update on LTA's decision announced on 6 January 2020 to study the feasibility of implementing noise mitigation measures along the stretch of the Pan-Island Expressway running adjacent to the HDB blocks in Bukit Batok SMC.,Mr Ong Ye Kung: The Land Transport Authority (LTA) has been studying the feasibility of various noise mitigation measures for this stretch of the Pan-Island Expressway (PIE). Trials have shown that low-noise pavement mix for at-grade sections of expressways are more effective in reducing noise for residents than vertical noise barriers. LTA will explore the feasibility of incorporating the low-noise pavement mix at a suitable juncture. We seek the Member and residents’ understanding and patience in the meantime. LTA remains committed to mitigating the impact of traffic noise and improving the quality of living for residents living near expressways.
plans to review and extend guidelines for covered linkways beyond 400 metres,Mr Don Wee asked the Minister for Transport whether LTA will review and extend the guidelines for covered linkways beyond 400 metres as they are an important part of our infrastructure to link people and amenities.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: The key objective of LTA's covered linkway programme is to connect large numbers of commuters to major public transport nodes like MRT/LRT stations and bus interchanges in a manner that is fiscally prudent. Covered linkways are provided within a 400 metre radius of key transport nodes, which includes connecting to nearby bus stops within walking distance. This also helps to ensure that our limited financial resources can be stretched to cover more locations and benefit more commuters after taking into account community feedback, as well as the needs of our more vulnerable commuters."
unprofitable bus services as of july 2020,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Transport (a) how many unprofitable bus services exist as of July 2020; and (b) what is the total subsidy level for unprofitable bus services each year.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: Prior to COVID-19, and as a result of better frequencies and service standards, 345 out of 356 public bus services generate fare revenues that cannot cover their operating costs and require government subsidies. This amounts to a total of about $1 billion per year. With COVID-19, commuter numbers have dropped, and as of July 2020, all public bus services generate fare revenues that cannot cover their operating costs. "
consequences for and enforcement against employers who have not made declaration for salary payment electronically,Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what percentage of employers have not made a declaration by 15 April 2020 that they will pay salaries electronically by the next salary payment due date; (b) what are the reasons cited for not doing so; (c) what are the consequences for this non-declaration given that electronic salary payment is now a legal requirement; and (d) how will the Ministry enforce this new law.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: The vast majority of employers are now paying salaries electronically. In the initial month of implementation, a very small number of employers were unable to do so, due to technical or administrative issues. For example, their workers' bank account applications were still pending approval by the bank. In these cases, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) allowed the employers to continue to pay outstanding salaries in cash. Due to its urgent necessity, this new requirement was introduced at very short notice. Nevertheless, the vast majority of employers have complied. MOM will continue to follow up and remind the remaining employers to make the switch if they have not already done so, especially now that circuit breaker measures have been lifted. MOM will in due course take enforcement action against non-compliance, as it would for other conditions under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act."
gender-disaggregated data on job and income losses during covid-19 outbreak period,Ms Yip Pin Xiu asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Ministry will release gender-disaggregated data on job and income losses during the COVID-19 outbreak period.,Mrs Josephine Teo: MOM releases gender-disaggregated labour market data such as unemployment and retrenchment indicators on a quarterly basis through the Labour Market Reports. The 1Q 2020 report will be released in mid-June.Gender-disaggregated gross monthly income data is released on an annual basis through the Ministry's Labour Force in Singapore report.
"statistics on complaints received by tripartite alliance for dispute management (tadm) in areas of wrongful dismissal, retrenchment and contractual termination",Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Minister for Manpower whether she can provide a statistical breakdown of complaints received by the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM) from 1 April 2019 to 31 May 2020 in the areas of (i) wrongful dismissal (ii) retrenchment and (iii) contractual termination.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: Table 1 below provides a breakdown of claims related to wrongful dismissal, retrenchment benefit and salary-in-lieu of notice received by the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM) between 1 April 2019 and 30 April 2020.In anticipation of the increase in claims since the start of the circuit breaker, MOM has strengthened the support to both employees and employers to resolve end-of-employment disputes. Where employees have filed wrongful dismissal claims, a good number have been due to the abrupt manner of termination rather than unfair terms – most employers have fulfilled their contractual obligations. With the complainants' agreement, we refer them to Workforce Singapore or e2i for employment facilitation. We recognise that this is a period of unusual stress for employers and employees alike. Regardless of their business circumstances, all employers should carry out termination of employment contracts fairly, responsibly and sensitively. They must continue to adhere to employment laws, contractual terms, and the relevant tripartite advisories.1 Employees are also encouraged to engage their employers to seek clarity on issues of concern. Where there are irresponsible practices by employers, MOM will investigate and take enforcement actions as necessary."
ensuring public safety when seeking mental healthcare services and standards of practice within the mental healthcare profession,Ms Yip Pin Xiu asked the Minister for Health (a) what is being done to ensure public safety when the public seek mental healthcare; (b) how can the general public check that mental health practitioners are competent and fit to practice; and (c) what is being done to uphold standards of practice within the mental healthcare profession.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Licensed healthcare institutions and clinics providing mental health services have systems in place to ensure that psychiatrists, psychologists and other mental health professionals are adequately trained. They also need to have mechanisms to monitor the quality of services provided and address any complaints.The list of registered doctors and their credentials are available on the Singapore Medical Council's website. Psychologists may choose to register with their professional associations. The public can refer to the websites of private psychology associations, such as the Singapore Psychological Society, for listings of psychologists registered with them.Both MOH and our healthcare institutions have systems in place to look into feedback or complaints against mental health practitioners. Patients may also lodge a complaint against doctors, including psychiatrists, with the Singapore Medical Council (SMC).To uphold and improve standards, the SMC requires doctors, including psychiatrists, to undergo continuing medical education before their practicing certificates can be renewed. For other professionals such as psychologists, the Skills Framework for Social Service spells out the skills and competencies required for each job. The framework helps healthcare providers, training providers and the professionals to identify training needs and develop training programmes to upskill these professionals.In addition, MOH and our healthcare institutions provide fellowships under the Healthcare Manpower Development Plan (HMDP) to send mental health professionals for specialised training. The HMDP scheme also facilitates visits by reputed overseas experts to Singapore to transfer knowledge and capability to local mental health professionals."
study on safety measures taken by other countries upon reopening of parks and nature areas,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether the Ministry has studied the safety measures taken by other countries as they reopen their parks and nature areas; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider reopening parks with safe distancing measures in place to allow Singaporeans and families to spend more time with nature.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Our parks and nature areas have remained open for the public to exercise throughout the circuit breaker period, with safe distancing measures in place. Besides deploying NParks officers as safe distancing ambassadors and enforcement officers on the ground, we also use mobile applications, robots, and drones to conduct crowd monitoring and ensure safe distancing. These allow NParks to track visitorship in real time and respond promptly to crowding. Visitors can also access real-time updates on visitorship online, so that they can exercise at uncrowded parks near their homes. Some facilities, such as car parks, food and beverage outlets, playgrounds, fitness corners, fishing areas, and certain beaches have been closed to allow for safe distancing and to prevent gathering in groups. We plan to gradually re-open these facilities in Phase 2 of the post-circuit breaker period with the necessary precautions. NParks will continue to study the measures taken by other countries as we reopen these facilities, and consider adopting additional safe management measures where relevant."
extent of information used for contact tracing from safeentry system for recent covid-19 incidents,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Health to what extent information from the SafeEntry system has been used to do contact tracing and alerts in relation to the incidents on 20-21 May 2020 whereby COVID-19 patients visited Jurong Point as well as other similar incidents.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: SafeEntry information has been used to strengthen the movement history information provided by confirmed COVID-19 cases, for purposes of contact tracing and epidemiological investigations. This includes the confirmed COVID-19 cases who had visited Jurong Point. The Ministry of Health (MOH) had used the check-in information from SafeEntry to confirm that COVID-19 cases had separately visited Jurong Point, and the specified outlets there. The information was used to formulate the list of public places that the cases had visited, and this has been made available to the public. Persons who had been at the locations during the specified times should monitor their health, and promptly seek medical care if they develop COVID-19 symptoms. MOH will continue to leverage on different modes of technology to better support the efforts to prevent and control the COVID-19 outbreak."
funds and time required in packing and distributing ndp funpacks this year and process to opt out of receiving funpacks,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Defence (a) how much state and sponsorship funds and NSF time will be used in packing and distributing the increased number of NDP funpacks this year; (b) whether the Ministry has considered specific items that the funds can be used in a way that brings forth the community spirit of Singaporeans and demonstrate our solidarity and gratitude with the workers on the frontlines of the COVID-19 crisis; (c) whether there will be a process to ensure citizens can opt out of receiving the funpacks; and (d) so, whether the savings from these opt-outs can be redirected to more urgent needs in this time of financial prudence, for example food programmes for those in need.","Dr Ng Eng Hen:  With regards to Question No. 1, the Member's question has been addressed in my reply to similar oral Questions 1, 2 and 3, as raised by MPs in this sitting."
installation of metal window grilles for hdb flats to enhance safety for young children and elderly,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry will consider installing metal window grilles for (i) owned and (ii) rental HDB flats to enhance safety for young children or the elderly who may move into these flats.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The Housing and Development Board (HDB) does not provide window grilles as a standard feature in its flats, whether sold or rental, as not all households require them.Flat owners who require window grilles, such as families with young children, can purchase them readily from the market, selecting from the range of options available based on their design preferences and budget. For HDB rental tenants, HDB will install window grilles for windows facing the external facade at no cost upon request. Tenants may approach HDB if they wish to have window grilles installed."
organisations and personnel with access to parliament livestream,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Communications and Information what are the organisations, whether Governmental, media or otherwise and what kinds of personnel within those organisations have access to the Parliament livestream offered by the Ministry.","Mr S Iswaran: Selected Government officials have access to Parliamentary livestreams to support their official work duties. Mediacorp and Singapore Press Holdings also have access, to facilitate accurate and timely reporting of parliamentary proceedings."
data on work permit holders not employed as foreign domestic workers and not eligible for work injury compensation for death and permanent disability in past five years,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Manpower in each of the past five years (a) how many work permit holders not employed as foreign domestic workers (FDWs) died from injuries or diseases for which the individual was not eligible for compensation under the Work Injury Compensation Act (WICA); (b) how many work permit holders not employed as FDWs suffered permanent disability from injuries or diseases for which the individual was not eligible for compensation under WICA; and (c) whether the Ministry will start collecting this data if it is not already doing so.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: Every year, around 0.3% of foreign work pass holders file claims under the Work Injury Compensation Act (WICA). Around 70 claims for fatal injuries and 2800 claims for permanent disability by foreign workers of all pass types are successfully resolved. They constitute the overwhelming majority of claims. Inadmissible claims were mostly because the injuries were attributed to non-work reasons. On average, around 1% of fatal injury claims and 5% of claims for permanent disability were inadmissible.Regardless of whether the WICA claims were admissible, employers are required to maintain medical insurance for their foreign workers and pay for all medical expenses incurred in Singapore. The Migrant Workers' Centre (MWC) also provides additional emergency assistance to migrant workers who are in need."
measures to strengthen singaporean core in workforce in light of deteriorating economic conditions,"Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Manpower in light of the deteriorating economic conditions that may lead to job losses, whether any steps will be taken to strengthen the Singaporean core in the workforce.","Mrs Josephine Teo: In the Unity, Resilience and Solidarity Budgets, the Government introduced measures to provide greater assurance and support to workers and businesses. Budget support measures, including the Jobs Support Scheme, have helped businesses to retain and retrain local workers. These measures have provided some cushion for the labour market. While the number of retrenchments rose in 1Q 2020, it was significantly lower than the quarterly peak during the Global Financial Crisis (1Q 2020: 3,000 (preliminary) versus 1Q 2009: 12,760). However, I expect labour market conditions to weaken in the second quarter given the sharp fall in demand globally, as well as the implementation of circuit breaker measures in Singapore. We have therefore stepped up efforts to help displaced workers reskill and find new employment opportunities.The recently-announced SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package under the Fortitude Budget aims to create a total of 100,000 jobs, traineeships, and training opportunities. We will be expanding the SGUnited Jobs initiative to provide more than 40,000 jobs for locals in 2020. There is a wide range of job opportunities under the SGUnited Jobs initiative, which has been running since end-March. This includes short-term jobs to handle COVID-19 related operations, as well as longer-term jobs created in the Public Service and publicly-funded sectors, such as healthcare and early childhood education. We will also scale up career conversion programmes under the Adapt and Grow and TechSkills Accelerator initiatives to help locals join sectors with strong growth potential.  We are providing our recent and new graduates, as well as mid-career jobseekers, with more opportunities to gain valuable industry-relevant experience through the SGUnited Traineeships and SGUnited Mid-Career Traineeships programmes. These will increase their employability and prepare them to seize new opportunities when the economy recovers. In the Unity Budget, we introduced a hiring incentive under the SkillsFuture Mid-Career Support Package. We are now enhancing the hiring incentive to cover all local workers, with higher support for mature workers. We are keeping our foreign workforce policy tight to ensure that our foreign workforce complements rather than substitutes our local workforce. We are maintaining the increases to the minimum qualifying salary at the Employment Pass and S Pass level which I announced this year, and are continuing with previously announced plans to cut the S Pass quota in various sectors. The quota system ensures companies retain a core of Singaporeans if they wish to continue hiring work permit and S Pass holders; a smaller base of locals will also mean a smaller quota. We also strengthened the Fair Consideration Framework earlier this year by requiring more jobs to be advertised and raising the penalties for all forms of discriminatory hiring practices. Strengthening the Singaporean core in the workforce remains our objective and we will continue to pursue this, even as we take into account current economic conditions."
plans to reopen economy in stages after circuit breaker ends,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Trade and Industry how will the economy be reopened in stages after the circuit breaker ends.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: Singapore will exit our Circuit Breaker from 2 June 2020. We will ramp up our economic activity safely, in order to protect lives and livelihoods.Currently, even during the Circuit Breaker period, we have allowed key companies in our global manufacturing, biomedical, and petrochemical sectors to continue functioning and supporting global supply chains.From 2 June 2020, we will resume additional economic activities that do not pose a high risk of transmission. Sectors that will be allowed to reopen or ramp up their operations in Phase One include those that are closely intertwined with global supply chains, and those in settings with lower transmission risks. These include most manufacturing and production facilities, as well as office-based businesses and those that do not require interactions with large groups of people.Businesses that reopen must comply with the requirements on safe management practices set out by the Ministry of Manpower and respective government agencies. These include enforcing safe distancing and mask wearing amongst their employees at the workplace, staggering working hours and break times, ensuring no cross-deployment of staff across teams or worksites, reducing physical interaction or mixing amongst workers, and cancelling or deferring social gatherings. In addition, businesses must allow their employees to Work From Home (WFH) to the maximum extent. Employees should only go into the office when demonstrably needed (e.g. to access systems or equipment that cannot be accessed from home, or to fulfil legal requirements such as completing contracts or transactions). The Government will conduct checks, and close businesses that do not provide a safe workplace, or fail to comply with safe management measures.If community transmission rates remain low and stable in Phase One, more firms will gradually be allowed to reopen in subsequent phases. These include more consumer services (e.g. retail shops), and fewer restrictions on existing services (e.g. dining-in will be allowed at F&B establishments). Employers should, however, still ensure that those who can WFH continue to do so."
payout conditions on employers regarding leave under jobs support scheme,Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Manpower whether employers who have received payouts under Jobs Support Scheme are required to adhere to any stipulation in relation to consumption of vacation leave by their employees or requiring employees to go on no-pay leave.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: Given the varied financial positions of employers, the tripartite partners agreed not to take a prescriptive approach on the type and degree of cost-saving measures (e.g. consumption of annual leave, no-pay leave) in issuing advisories1 to guide employers. With the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) payout, employers should provide some wage support to employees even if their employees are not working. To manage cost pressures and conserve manpower for when they are most needed, employers may request employees to clear some of their paid annual leave when business activity has been sharply reduced. Employers should be allowed to do so, and encouraged to seek their employees’ support and understanding to help the business get ready for business resumption. Where employers have genuine cashflow issues, they may not even be able to afford placing employees on paid annual leave and may have to request employees to go on no-pay leave, in order to avoid the worse alternative of retrenchment. In such instances, tripartite partners have made it clear that employers should allow their employees to seek additional temporary employment to boost their incomes. The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) is closely monitoring such cost-saving measures to ensure that they are implemented responsibly and fairly with reasonable support to employees. We will investigate employees' concerns that are brought to our attention. Irresponsible employers may see a withdrawal of Government-paid employment support including future JSS payouts, and suspension of their work pass privileges.The tripartite partners urge both employers and employees to be open, transparent and understanding in their discussions on cost-saving measures and take a long-term view on saving jobs and emerging stronger together from the crisis."
actual and expected conversion of natural spaces to urban development and carbon sequestered under ura concept plan,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for National Development (a) in the past 20 years, how much land has been converted from natural spaces to urban developments; (b) how much land is expected to be converted from natural spaces to urban developments under the URA Concept Plan; (c) what is the area of primary and mature secondary forests expected to be affected under the URA Concept Plan; and (d) what is the amount of carbon that is currently sequestered by the area expected to be affected under the URA Concept Plan.","Mr Lawrence Wong: The question by Ms Ong presumes that we are reducing the green and natural spaces in Singapore. But in fact, our urban plans seek to expand such spaces. In 2000, we had about 5,500 hectares of land in nature reserves, nature areas, nature parks, parks and gardens. We have increased this to 7,800 hectares today.  Under the Master Plan 2019, which guides development over the next 10 to 15 years, we will add another 1,000 hectares of parks, gardens, and park connectors. We announced plans to transform Singapore from a City in a Garden into a City in Nature during the Committee of Supply debate in March 2020, including plans for a new nature park at Sungei Khatib Bongsu, and planting one million trees by 2030. We will also continue implementing innovative and practical solutions to intensify greenery and restore nature in our urban areas, to further enhance liveability for our residents. In addition, where there are any new developments close to sensitive nature areas, robust assessments are undertaken in consultation with stakeholders, to ensure that the development works are done in an environmentally sensitive manner.These efforts, together with other efforts to enhance our natural ecosystem and marine environment that provide carbon storage and sequestration, will strengthen our climate resilience. Singapore is committed to tackling climate change and meeting our pledge to peak emissions at 65 MtCO2e around 2030 in support of the transition towards a low-carbon and climate-resilient future."
current and projected 2030 energy composition for electricity generation and plans to phase out fossil fuels,Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Trade and Industry with regard to the target of generating 90% of Singapore's electricity through natural gas (a) what is the current energy composition for electricity generation; (b) what is the expected composition in 2030; and (c) whether there are plans to phase out the most carbon intensive fossil fuels like coal and oil from electricity generation by 2030.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: About 95% of Singapore's electricity is generated using natural gas. Non-fossil fuel sources (e.g. municipal waste, biomass and solar) accounts for 3%. The rest comes from a mixture of coal, diesel and fuel oil.Natural gas, the cleanest form of fossil fuel, will continue to be Singapore's dominant energy source in 2030. We are working with power generation companies and industries to reduce their usage of high carbon fuels. In addition, we aim to increase our solar capacity by six-fold, achieving at least two Gigawatt-peak (GWp) by 2030. This will contribute to about 3% of our energy demand in 2030. We are also exploring opportunities to import clean energy from our neighbouring countries."
number of claims reported for work injury sustained at home while on remote working arrangement from 1 january to 31 may 2020,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Minister for Manpower what is the annual number of work injury claims reported to the Ministry from 1 January 2010 to 31 May 2020 where the work injury occurred at home while on a remote working arrangement.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: MOM started tracking work injuries at home since the start of the Circuit Breaker period from 7 April 2020.  Since then, two work injuries were reported to have occurred at home while on remote working arrangements. The claims are currently being examined. As in all work injury claims, it is necessary to determine if the injuries arose out of and in the course of work. Employees with work injuries, including injury sustained while working from home, are eligible for compensation under the Work Injury Compensation Act (WICA).   "
data on number of dogs euthanised and their causes in past five years,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for National Development (a) in each of the past five years, how many dogs have been euthanised for (i) medical reasons (ii) aggression-related reasons and (iii) non-medical and non-aggression-related reasons; and (b) whether the Ministry will start collecting this data if it is not already doing so.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Currently, NParks does not collect data on the cause of death of dogs, including from euthanasia. NParks will look into this as part of its ongoing efforts to ensure that establishments uphold standards of good practice in animal welfare.  "
number of deaths and breakdown by causes of work permit and special pass holders in each of past 10 years,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how many persons on work permits and special passes have died each year in the past 10 years; and (b) what is the breakdown of the cases by cause of death.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: Between 2009 and 2019, an average of 230 work permit holders died each year. This translates into a death rate of about 0.02%. The main causes of death were from natural causes, suicides, traffic accidents and workplace accidents. MOM does not have the corresponding data for special pass holders."
total number of scam cases reported and accumulated financial losses since covid-19 pandemic started and preventive action taken to protect senior citizens from such scams,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is the total number of scam cases reported since the COVID-19 pandemic started; (b) what is the accumulated financial losses arising from such scams; and (c) what action is the police taking to prevent such scams especially among senior citizens.,"Mr K Shanmugam: From January to April 2020, a total of 5,425 scam cases were reported with at least $60.4 million cheated. Of these, 394 were COVID-19 related scams, with at least $1.4 million cheated.There are three scam types of concern that are related to COVID-19. First, e-commerce scams relating to the sale of face masks and hand sanitisers. Second, scams where scammers impersonate officials from the Ministry of Health (MOH) to obtain from victims their personal data and information. Third, phishing scams involving fraudulent emails and text messages containing fake offers or fake information on COVID-19 payouts, to trick victims into divulging their credit or debit card details and One-Time Passwords (OTP).The Police have been taking action against such scammers. Between 3 February and 8 April 2020, they mounted island-wide operations leading to the arrest of 27 persons who were involved in scams amounting to more than $484,000. In these cases, the scammers had exploited the use of e-commerce platforms and online channels such as Gumtree, Facebook Marketplace, Carousell, WhatsApp and Telegram. Of the 27 subjects, 16 have been charged in Court.The Police are also ramping up public education and awareness efforts. They and the National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC) are working with the Ministry of Communications and Information to issue scam advisories via WhatsApp on the Gov.sg platform. Prior to the COVID-19 situation, the Police were already working with Residents’ Committees and grassroots volunteers to spread scam alerts to residents, including senior citizens, via WhatsApp and community events like block parties, roadshows, festive events and Community Safety & Security Programmes (CSSPs). One such CSSP focusing on the elderly is the Silver Watch Group. Launched in 2013, the initiative aims to impart elderly residents with crime prevention knowledge by keeping them informed of the latest crime situation and encouraging them to share relevant advice with their peers. These activities will resume gradually with the easing of safe distancing measures.The key to the fight against scams is a discerning public. We should be sceptical of promises of incredulous inducements, transact only on reliable platforms, and always check with the relevant authorities when approached by dubious entities purporting to be their officials.Everyone has a part to play in the fight against scams. Members of the public are urged to stay vigilant and report possible scams promptly to the Police."
extending relief under part 2 of covid-19 (temporary measures) act 2020 to cover rental agreements between vehicle hire companies and private hire car drivers,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Minister for Law whether relief under Part 2 of the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020 can be extended to cover rental agreements between vehicle hire companies and private hire car drivers.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020 (the ""Act"") provides temporary relief from legal action for those who are unable to perform certain contracts as a result of COVID-19. The Government has studied the possibility of extending temporary relief under Part 2 of the Act to rental agreements between vehicle hire companies and Private Hire Car (PHC) drivers, but has assessed that this is not necessary for the time being. Part 2 of the Act imposes a moratorium on legal action, so that parties have time to negotiate and work out their differences. However, this does not, in itself, address the substantive decline in earnings faced by drivers during this period. To this end, the Government has been working closely with the taxi and PHC operators, the National Taxi Association (NTA), and the National Private Hire Vehicles Association (NPHVA), to provide targeted relief for drivers. The current package of relief measures includes cash grants, initiatives by operators, creating supplementary sources of income for drivers, and providing upskilling opportunities for drivers to move into adjacent sectors.For instance, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) has worked with tripartite partners to launch the Point-to-Point Support Package (PPSP) to support drivers who have seen their livelihoods badly affected. Through the PPSP's Special Relief Fund (SRF), active PHC drivers can receive up to $10 per vehicle per day (or $300 per month), until 12 October 2020. Apart from the SRF, PHC drivers can also draw on the Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme (SIRS) which provides eligible persons with $1,000 per month for nine months (or $9,000 in total).All in all, under the SRF and SIRS, drivers can receive up to $1,300 of Government support per month in support to tide them over this challenging period. This is in addition to the Solidarity Payment, and other cash payouts announced under the enhanced Care and Support Package.The Government also notes that some PHC operators and rental companies have stepped forward to offer rental waivers and discounts on commission fees.  To enable drivers to supplement their income, LTA has also temporarily allowed drivers to deliver food and groceries. To date, more than 10,000 drivers have taken on deliveries, and this has helped to cushion the fall in ridership earnings. LTA will continue working with tripartite partners to help drivers.Support is also available for drivers who are looking to upskill and move laterally into adjacent sectors, or into new sectors. Under the Self-Employed Persons (SEP) Training Support Scheme, SEPs can receive up to $10 per hour when they attend approved courses. To sum up, the Government has been working closely with tripartite partners in the PHC ecosystem to come together and share the burden in an equitable manner. For now, the Government has assessed that legislative intervention is not necessary. We will however continue to monitor the situation, and make changes if necessary."

reason for recent flash floods and plans to tackle issue,"Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what is the reason for the recent flash floods in several areas in Singapore, including Sennett Estate in Potong Pasir, despite the drainage system being recently expanded; and (b) what are PUB's plans to further tackle this issue moving forward.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: On the afternoon of 30 April 2020, strong solar heating of land areas coupled with convergence of winds in the region led to intense thundery showers over Paya Lebar, Punggol and Hougang. The total rainfall of 128.4 millimetres that day was one of the highest daily rainfall ever recorded in Singapore over the past 30 years. As the capacity of roadside drains were overwhelmed by the intense rainfall, flash floods resulted at locations such as Upper Paya Lebar Service Road, Lorong Gambir, Tampines Road, Serangoon Avenue 2 and Lichi Avenue (which is close to Sennett Estate). These flash floods lasted between 10 to 30 minutes. PUB officers were on site to actively engage affected residents, provide sandbags and loan the portable Dam-Easy flood panels to prevent floodwaters from entering homes. These flood panels, which the Public Utilities Board (PUB) started loaning to residents and businesses in flood-prone areas since the start of the monsoon season in 2019, can be set up quickly during a flash flood. These flood panels were used by one of the residents during the 30 April 2020 rainstorm, who found them effective in preventing water from entering his home.Drainage Improvement WorksAs part of PUB's broader efforts to address the impacts of climate change, PUB had raised the drainage design standards to cater to higher rainfall intensity in 2011. Since then, the Government has invested almost $2 billion in drainage works, and will invest another $190 million this year to enhance our flood resilience.In most of the areas affected by the intense rainfall on 30 April 2020, a number of flood alleviation projects have been recently completed or are ongoing. For example, PUB completed the upgrading of the Tampines Canal (from Hougang Avenue 1 to Hougang Avenue 7) in March 2019 at a project cost of $27 million to alleviate flooding along Tampines Road. The hydraulic analysis showed that the completed works had successfully reduced the flood area by 86%, including a large section of Tampines Road. As a result, the flash flood on 30 April 2020 was confined to a localised road depression at the junction of Tampines Road and Hougang Avenue 1. PUB will study the feasibility of raising the depressed road junction.For the low-lying Upper Paya Lebar Service Road, works are on-going to divert stormflow from existing drains to larger new drains. The works are expected to complete in 2021 and will further improve flood protection in these areas. In addition, PUB will be upgrading the drains serving Serangoon Avenue 2 and Lorong Gambir to alleviate flooding. These works are expected to commence over the next two years.In the case of Sennett Estate, which is a low-lying area and prone to flooding, PUB has been progressively upgrading the drains serving the estate between 2006 and 2015. There are on-going works to upgrade the remaining stretches of drains in the estate. When completed in 2021, flood protection for Sennett Estate will be further enhanced.While PUB will continue with efforts to improve drainage systems, it is not practical to expand our drains to meet every extreme rainfall event in land-scarce Singapore. Besides drainage improvements, PUB will put in place cost-effective measures to minimise flood risks and better manage flood events. For instance, PUB is in the midst of upgrading its rainfall forecasting radar technology, which will help improve prediction of locations where heavy rainfall might occur and enhance its response time to potential flash floods. Members of the public can also stay updated on weather and flash flood warnings by subscribing to NEA's or PUB's mobile apps and SMS alerts. In the event of a flash flood, members of the public are advised to take appropriate safety measures, such as to avoid driving and walking in flooded areas."
ascertaining commercial property landlords’ compliance with requirement to pass on full amount of rebates to tenants under covid-19 support measures,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance whether tenants of commercial properties have the right to ascertain from IRAS what is the total amount of property tax rebate received by their respective landlords under the COVID-19 support measures to enable tenants to make an informed decision about whether landlords have complied with the requirement to pass on the full amount of the rebates to their tenants.,"Mr Heng Swee Keat: The property tax rebate is granted to the owner of the property, as he is the party who is liable for the property tax in the first instance. IRAS does not disclose information on the property tax and property tax rebate to third parties, including a tenant of the property.Nevertheless, the tenant of the property owner can request for information from the property owner on the amount of property tax rebate received. The property owner will then be required to provide his tenant with this information, and failure to do so will constitute an offence.If there is a disagreement on whether the property owner has complied with the requirement to pass on the property tax rebate fully, the property owner or his tenant may apply to the Valuation Review Panel to hear and determine the dispute."
supply of certificates of entitlement after lifting of circuit breaker measures,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for Transport what is LTA's plan for the supply of Certificates of Entitlement (COEs) once COE bidding resumes after the circuit breaker measures are lifted.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Motor vehicle dealerships and showrooms have been closed since the start of the circuit breaker. As COE bidding is done mostly by the motor vehicle dealers on behalf of prospective owners, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) suspended COE bidding for the months of April and May. To keep community transmission low, the Government has announced plans to resume economic activities in a cautious manner, in phases. Motor vehicle dealerships have not yet been allowed to re-open. COE bidding will only resume after the dealers are allowed to re-open. As new travel demand patterns may emerge as a result of COVID-19, LTA will monitor the situation closely before deciding how the accumulated COE quotas from the suspended bidding exercises should be factored into future bidding exercises."
gross monthly income of full-time employed resident workers above 15 years old at bottom percentiles,"Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Manpower for each year in the last three years, what is the gross monthly income of full-time employed resident workers who are above 15 years old at the bottom 5th to 20th percentiles, excluding employer's CPF contributions.",Note: Mr Speaker has given his approval for the above question to be withdrawn. 
"complaints about psychiatrists, psychologists and counsellors from lgbtq clients, complaint mechanisms available and sanctions and punishments meted out","Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the Ministry has received any complaints about psychiatrists, psychologists and counsellors from their LGBTQ clients and, if so, what are the complaints; (b) what are the complaint mechanisms available to their LGBTQ clients; and (c) how are errant individuals reported by their LGBTQ clients sanctioned or punished.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: MOH has not received any complaints against psychiatrists, psychologists and counsellors from self-declared LGBTQ patients in the past three years.MOH and our healthcare institutions have systems in place to handle feedback or complaints against psychiatrists, psychologists and counsellors. Patients may also seek assistance from the Singapore Mediation Centre for complaints against psychologists and counsellors or lodge a complaint against psychiatrists with the Singapore Medical Council. Psychiatrists are regulated under the Medical Registration Act which sets out the disciplinary processes and the set-up of disciplinary bodies, namely the independent Complaints Committees and Disciplinary Tribunals. The Complaints Committee will review each complaint and decide on one of the following actions: (a) dismiss the complaint, (b) issue a Letter of Advice, (c) issue a Letter of Warning, (d) refer the doctor to the Disciplinary Tribunal or the Health Committee for a formal inquiry. The Disciplinary Tribunal has the power to remove the doctor from the register, suspend the practicing license for a certain period of time or impose a fine of up to $100,000."
"differences in life expectancy, incidence of chronic illnesses and acute hospital re-admission rates between highest and lowest 20% income groups and progress made in tackling health inequalities","Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Health for each of the last three years, comparing between Singaporeans in the highest 20% and lowest 20% income group (a) what is the difference in life expectancy; (b) what is the difference in percentage of Singaporeans who suffer from (i) one chronic illness and (ii) two or more chronic illnesses respectively; (c) what is the difference in the acute hospital 30-day re-admission rate; (d) how does the Ministry measure health inequalities in Singapore; and (e) whether Singapore has made progress in tackling health inequalities.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Data on life expectancy, hospital 30-day re-admissions and prevalence of chronic conditions by income groups is not available. There are many factors that influence hospital re-admissions. For example, the patient's age, presence of any pre-existing conditions, reason for initial hospital admission, quality of inpatient care, transition to community care, and follow-up care. Home environment and family support are also important contributing factors. Public hospitals have introduced various programmes to reduce re-admissions. This includes the Hospital-to-Home (H2H) programme, which supports patients' transition home and links patients and care-givers with appropriate community-based services. The H2H programme has served more than 14,000 patients.For chronic conditions, using educational levels as a proxy for socio-economic status (SES), men with primary education and below were more likely to have diabetes (1.3 times), but less likely to have hypertension (0.9 times) or high cholesterol (0.6 times) when compared to men with post-secondary education. However, for women with primary education and below, the chances were higher at 3.4 times for diabetes, 1.9 times for hypertension, and 1.4 times for high cholesterol compared to those with post-secondary education.1Persons in the lower SES group with chronic diseases have good access to healthcare services and health outcomes. Among Singaporeans with primary education and below who have chronic conditions like diabetes, hypertension and high blood cholesterol, more than 90% had visited their doctor in the previous year for their condition. They had comparable disease outcomes with better educated Singaporeans in managing their blood sugar and cholesterol levels, although less so for blood pressure control.Individuals can achieve good health outcomes by taking charge of their health, seeking timely treatment and adopting healthy lifestyles. MOH facilitates this by reducing cost barriers to healthcare. For example, on health screening, subsidies under Screen for Life were enhanced in September 2017. Under this revised scheme, Pioneer Generation pays $0 for screening whereas Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) blue/orange cardholders (as well as Merdeka Generation since November 2019) pay only $2, and all other Singaporeans pay $5. This payment covers screening tests, doctor's consultation as well as the first follow-up consultation at CHAS GP clinics.MOH will continue to monitor health inequalities and put in place measures to ensure that all Singaporeans have access to quality and timely healthcare."
annual revenue generated by private security sector and value-add per worker for 2015 to 2018 and total industry revenue of security technology firms for 2018 and 2019,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what is the annual revenue generated by the private security sector from 2015 to 2019; (b) what is the value add (VA) per worker for the same period; and (c) what is the total industry revenue of security technology firms for 2018 and 2019.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: Between 2015 and 2018, the revenue of the private security industry averaged $2.2 billion per year, while its nominal value-added (VA) per worker averaged $38,300 per year (refer to Table 1).1,2 The total revenue of the security technology industry was $651 million in 2018.1,3"
additional plans to bring down high number of dengue cases in order not to overwhelm healthcare system fighting against covid-19 outbreak,Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources what are the additional plans to tackle and bring down the expected high number of dengue cases so as not to overwhelm the healthcare service providers who are currently heavily engaged in the fight against the COVID-19 outbreak.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The total number of dengue cases in 2020 has exceeded 6,000 so far – more than double that over the same period in 2019. The number of weekly dengue cases remains high, hovering at around 300 to 400 cases per week, and the total number of dengue cases is projected to exceed the 16,000 cases in 2019. To manage the expected increase in cases as we approach the traditional peak dengue season, The National Environment Agency's (NEA) dengue operations are continuing during this circuit breaker period. NEA has also called for all stakeholders to take concerted action to suppress the Aedes mosquito population.  Regular housekeeping and maintenance of premises and common areas are crucial to curb dengue transmission. Raising the standards of personal and public hygiene are not only critical for our defence against COVID-19, they also mitigate the spread of dengue. Good housekeeping at residential premises is critical, especially as more people are working from home. NEA has observed a 50% increase in Aedes mosquito breeding in homes over the past three years, compared to the preceding three years. NEA therefore brought forward the launch of the National Dengue Prevention campaign to 22 March to rally the community to be vigilant in carrying out the Mozzie Wipeout to remove potential mosquito breeding habitats. Homeowners of landed houses are also urged to check their roof gutters and perimeter drains in their compounds for potential mosquito breeding habitats.NEA is working closely with stakeholders in the Inter-Agency Dengue Task Force, including Town Councils, to remove potential mosquito breeding habitats in public areas and housing estates. Despite increased demands on the cleaning sector arising from the ongoing COVID-19 situation, NEA has worked with our cleaning service providers and Town Councils to ensure that cleaning of higher footfall areas and flushing of drains are not compromised, and even stepped up as necessary.Even though businesses are closed during the circuit breaker period, NEA requires owners of premises and work sites to continue with proactive vector control measures. Pest control operators are allowed to continue operating during the circuit breaker period. Owners of premises, especially construction and renovation sites which have a propensity for water pooling that allows for larger mosquito breeding habitats, should apply for ""Time-Limited Exemptions"" for their workers to return to their premises to perform essential mosquito prevention measures during this period. NEA has also embarked on a stepped-up inspection regime of construction sites, prioritising hotspots which are located in dengue clusters or have a previous record of mosquito breeding. NEA has reached out to members of the Singapore Contractors Association Limited and operators of dormitories to sustain their vector control works. This posture will be maintained for the entire duration of the Circuit Breaker period. All stakeholders, residents, contractors and business owners, have a part to play in preventing dengue. Everyone must step up efforts to eradicate mosquito breeding habitats together, uphold good personal and public hygiene, to protect themselves and their loved ones from dengue and COVID-19."
better support for essential service workers living outside dormitories during covid-19 outbreak,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng asked the Minister for National Development how can essential service workers such as cleaners of town councils who live outside of the dormitories be better supported by the Government and residents especially during the COVID-19 outbreak.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Workers performing essential services play an integral role in ensuring that critical functions remain operational during the circuit breaker period. In Town Councils, essential services include services such as conservancy and lift management. In response to the economic challenges posed by the COVID-19 outbreak, the Government has rolled out a series of support measures. These include the corporate income tax rebate, the waiver and rebate of the foreign worker levy, and the Jobs Support Scheme, where the Government co-funds up to 75% of the wages of local employees. These measures will help to stabilise businesses and minimise any impact on the livelihoods of our workers, including those in essential services. The Government has also taken steps to safeguard our essential service workers. To suppress the spread of COVID-19 at workplaces, employers are required, by law, to implement appropriate safe distancing measures. Specific to the cleaning sector, the tripartite partners have issued a joint advisory to ensure the sustainability of the sector in view of COVID-19. Amongst other measures, this advisory calls upon employers to provide suitable protective equipment, and to remunerate their cleaners appropriately, such as through increasing the wages of cleaners with higher workloads. Essential service workers with concerns about workplace safety or other employment matters can provide feedback to MOM for further follow-up. To minimise the risk of transmission amongst workers during the circuit breaker period, there has also been a reduction in the number of workers performing essential services. This could result in degradation of services, and we seek the public’s understanding on this matter. We thank all essential service workers for their efforts and call upon the public to also show their support."
"statistics on public rental flat tenancy terminations, downgrades to smaller rental flats, eligibility criteria for assistance measures and demographics of recipient households in last three years","Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for National Development (a) in the last three years, how many households living in public rental flats have respectively experienced (i) a termination of rental tenancy due to arrears or (ii) have been downgraded to a smaller rental flat due to arrears; (b) how many households currently owe rental arrears to HDB, broken down by duration and amount of arrears; (c) what are the eligibility criteria for financial assistance measures provided by HDB and what does the financial assistance cover; and (d) what is the demographics of the households, in terms of (i) household size (ii) flat type and (iii) household monthly income per capita, who received financial assistance measures from HDB.","Mr Lawrence Wong: About 5,200 public rental households, or about 10% of all public rental households, are in rent arrears. In terms of value, about 75% of them owe less than $3,000 in rent, and in terms of duration, about half of them owe less than one year's worth of rent. The Housing Development Board (HDB) takes a compassionate and holistic approach when assisting tenants who are in arrears, and will seek to understand their individual circumstances. HDB has various assistance measures in place to help public rental households in arrears.For households whose financial circumstances have changed (e.g. household income has fallen), HDB will assist to reduce their monthly rent upon appeal. Tenants who need more time to resolve their arrears are also allowed to pay off the arrears in instalments. HDB also works closely with MSF's Social Service Offices (SSOs), and will refer households who may be in need of financial assistance to the SSOs. For tenants who prefer to move to a smaller rental flat to ease their rental burden, HDB will help to facilitate their transfer. In the last three years, HDB assisted 159 households in arrears to move from 2-room flats to 1-room flats. The vast majority of them had four persons or fewer in the household. Termination of rental tenancies is only taken as a last resort, and would not be solely due to the accumulation of rent arrears. In the last three years, there has been only one case of such termination."
"anticipated and actual impact of circuit breaker on economy, possible trigger for another circuit breaker and singapore's preparedness",Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what is the impact of circuit breaker on our economy; (b) whether the extent is as anticipated; (c) what will trigger another circuit breaker; and (d) how prepared is Singapore should another circuit breaker be necessary.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: On 3 April, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce announced a set of circuit breaker measures, including only permitting entities providing essential services to continue operating onsite with reduced manpower. This took effect from 7 April. Around 80,000 entities were allowed to operate, with 21% of our total workforce operating on-site. On 21 April, the Taskforce directed a further reduction in work premises which could operate on-site. Around 45,000 entities were allowed to operate, with 17% of our total workforce operating on-site.We are acutely aware that the circuit breaker will disrupt businesses and have a substantial impact on our economy, but it is also essential in the fight against COVID-19. Our primary objective in this fight is to save lives and protect Singaporeans and our families. We recognise that the more stringent the measures we put in place to curb transmission of the virus, the bigger the impact on our economy. But the alternative of not taking sufficiently stringent measures to curb the virus will result in more infections and more deaths.We must therefore work together – business, workers and Government – to make the circuit breaker as effective as possible so that we protect lives and recover faster and emerge stronger. Every business can play their part – strictly observe the circuit breaker measures and shut down onsite activities if you have not received approval to operate so that your workers and their families can stay safe. For essential firms that have to continue to operate, minimise the number of workers who have to travel to work onsite and make sure that safe distancing measures are implemented at the workplace. As long as we can keep the number of cases low, this will mitigate the need for a circuit breaker."
interest rates for loans offered to smes under government risk sharing schemes vis-à-vis commercial rates,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what are the average interest rates or the range of interest rates for loans offered to SMEs under the Government risk sharing schemes; (b) how do these differ from interest rates for loans offered commercially without Government's risk sharing; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider requiring banks offering loans with 80% or 90% Government risk sharing to set interest rates at levels significantly below interest rates for non-Government-backed loans under similar circumstances.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: The Government introduced the Temporary Bridging Loan Programme (TBLP) and enhanced the Enterprise Financing Scheme – SME Working Capital Loan (EFS-WCL) Programme in the Unity Budget, to help enterprises cope with their working capital needs during the COVID-19 situation. The schemes were further enhanced in the Resilience and Solidarity Budgets. In addition, the MAS SGD Facility for ESG Loans was launched on 20 April 2020 for banks and finance companies. It provides them with funding for two years at an interest rate of 0.1% per annum, for the purpose of their loans to SMEs under the ESG loan schemes.Under the ESG loan schemes, the interest rate of loans taken up by over 95% of the SMEs applying in April 2020 ranged from 2% to 4.5% per annum, compared to 6% or more for most other unsecured working capital loans to SMEs.Following the introduction of the new MAS SGD facility, interest rates for such loans is expected to be around 2 to 3% for most borrowers. Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) have committed to pass on lower interest rates to borrowers. ESG and MAS will continue to monitor the situation to ensure that SMEs are able to access financing during this crisis."
financial assistance for essential outpatient and inpatient medical treatment and plans to liberalise use of medisave and medifund on account of covid-19 outbreak,"Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked the Minister for Health (a) since January 2020, whether there has been an increase in the number of patients appealing for financial assistance for essential outpatient and inpatient medical treatment; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider liberalising the use of MediSave and MediFund considering the economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: The number of patients who have appealed for financial assistance for medical treatment since January 2020 has remained about the same as that over the same period in previous years. Notwithstanding this, MOH has already put in place measures to improve healthcare affordability during this period. These include:(i) Free COVID-19 treatment for Singaporeans, except for those who choose to continue travelling against travel advisories during this period.(ii) Special subsidies for Singaporeans at the Public Health Preparedness Clinics for Acute Respiratory Infection diagnoses, to remove financial barriers to care.(iii) Extension of CHAS subsidy and MediSave for video-consultations of selected chronic conditions, to allow suitable patients to receive treatment at home.We will continue to work closely with healthcare institutions to identify patients who might be in need of financial assistance, exercise flexibility for appeals, and implement enhancements to our healthcare financing schemes to ensure that healthcare remains affordable for all Singaporeans."
measures to enhance cybersecurity for school websites and online home-based learning,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Education what measures will be implemented to enhance cybersecurity for school websites and online home-based learning especially after the COVID-19 circuit breaker period is over.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: Our systems need to be secure and resilient to the evolving cybersecurity threats. For schools websites, these have been migrated to the Whole-of-Government Content Websites Platform since December 2016. This allows centralised management of the infrastructure design and implementation of adequate cybersecurity controls for these websites. As for the Student Learning Space, we have put in place the necessary cybersecurity controls in the design, implementation and management of the national digital learning platform for schools. Measures include requiring robust passwords for logins as well as regular security testing and reviews. The Ministry of Education (MOE) is also working closely with video-conferencing platform providers to ensure online live lessons are conducted in a safe and secure environment. MOE has worked on centrally managing the security settings of these platforms to provide a consistent experience while safeguarding the usage of the systems.We will also continue with user education in the form of guides, training videos, and webinars. Similar guides have also been provided to parents and students on how to safeguard themselves in the online space. This is part of the Cyber Wellness Education that we already have in place."
need to advertise in jobs bank for 14 days prior to hiring of personalised employment pass holders and rationale for non-advertisement,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether employers need to advertise a job on the Jobs Bank for 14 days prior to hiring a Personalised Employment Pass holder for that job; and (b) if not, what is the rationale.","Mrs Josephine Teo: Personalised Employment Passes (PEP) are granted selectively to persons in senior or highly specialised roles. Unlike Employment Pass (EP) applicants, PEP holders do not require an employer to sponsor their application. They are however required to notify MOM when they find employment, instead of their employers applying for approval. The advertising requirement does not arise as a result.  The PEP regime is similar to schemes in other countries, such as the Global Talent Visa in the United Kingdom and the Global Talent Independent programme in Australia, which support businesses in accessing senior or highly specialised persons. In the last few years, PEP holders have accounted for around 1% of all new EPs issued.  "
efforts to assist those affected by covid-19 crisis needing urgent legal advice in light of circuit breaker and suspension of physical legal clinics,"Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Law in light of the circuit breaker and the suspension of physical legal clinics (a) what are the efforts to ensure that those who need urgent legal advice are able to receive assistance; and (b) whether the Ministry looking at coordinating more specific guidance or legal support for those who may be affected by the COVID-19 crisis such as tenants, landlords, and businesses.","Mr K Shanmugam: The Ministry of Law and many of our partners continue to provide legal services during the circuit breaker period. (a) The Legal Aid Bureau continues to provide legal advice, legal assistance, and legal aid on civil matters, to Singapore citizens and Permanent Residents with limited means.  (b) Accused persons with limited means may also continue to apply for criminal legal aid from Law Society Pro Bono Services (LSPBS) for matters which the Courts continue to hear.(c) Persons in need of legal assistance may also seek help from Law Society's Community Legal Clinics as well as several other legal clinics.Given the need to reduce movement of people, services will be delivered remotely via video conferencing, email or telephone, where possible. In addition, members of public can access various online tools that provide useful legal information. For example, the iLAB chatbot on the Legal Aid Bureau's website provides tailored legal information on divorce and family violence. It is also able to generate simple legal documents for those who can self-help. Another example is the Community Justice Centre's Automated Court Document Assembly and Generation, which provides step-by-step guidance on filing certain court forms.Ms Rahayu also asked about the Ministry's efforts at coordinating specific legal support for those affected by COVID-19. There are two aspects to our efforts. First, we are supporting law practices in their continued provision of legal services during the circuit breaker period. The Ministry of Law has worked with the Ministry of Trade and Industry to allow the continued provision of urgent and essential legal services.1 For all other legal activities, where law practices may need to work from their office on an exceptional basis, they may apply for time-limited exemptions as and when necessary. This is to enable law practices to continue serving the urgent legal needs of citizens and businesses.Second, we are coordinating measures to provide relief via legislation to individuals and businesses. One such example is the relief for certain types of contracts under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020, which recently came into force on 20 April 2020. This will help Singaporeans, from SMEs struggling to pay rent, to wedding couples whose weddings have to be postponed. We will monitor the situation closely, and will consider further measures as needed."
breakdown and rationale of funds allocated for suicide prevention services on annual basis,Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Health (a) how much funds are allocated to suicide prevention services on an annual basis; (b) what is the breakdown of such funding for (i) government-run services and (ii) community partners including the Samaritans of Singapore (SOS); and (c) what is the rationale for current funding levels for suicide prevention services.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Singapore adopts a multi-prong approach to suicide prevention based on building mental resilience, encouraging help seeking and early identification, supporting at-risk groups, and providing crisis support.The reasons for suicides are often complex and multi-dimensional requiring a holistic management approach. Consequently, funds have been allocated for overall mental health awareness, prevention, detection and intervention and not specially for suicide prevention. In FY18, MOH's expenditure on mental health was approximately $310 million, comprising operating subvention to Institute of Mental Health (IMH), psychiatry services in Public Healthcare Institutions and intermediate and long-term care facilities, including funding for the various programmes under the National Mental Health Blueprint and Community Mental Health Masterplan.  Social service agencies also have a key role in suicide prevention, by providing community-based intervention and support to individuals who are in distress. Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) provides support to individuals facing crises, thinking about or are affected by suicide. In addition to SOS, agencies such as Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH) and TOUCH community services provide helpline and counselling services to the general public and youths respectively. These early intervention and upstream support help to reduce suicide ideation and suicide attempts. The National Council of Social Service (NCSS) provided $8.7 million and $5.7 million in funding to Social Service Agencies (SSAs) for mental health support services and counselling programmes respectively in FY18. In addition to funding suicide prevention services, NCSS has launched Belle, an interactive Helpbot to consolidate and provide 24/7 access to information about helplines and mental health services to make it easier for users to seek help when they need it.MOH will continue to work with public hospitals and service providers in the community, including schools, social service agencies and family service centres, to ensure that we provide holistic and timely support for persons with mental healthcare needs.  "
quantum of wage subsidies for service industries/companies of hotels deriving 100% of business from hotels,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance whether the same quantum of wage subsidies can be given to supporting service industries/companies of hotels which derive 100% of their business from the hotels.,"Mr Heng Swee Keat: The Ministry of Finance recognises the significant challenges faced by firms during this difficult time. As such, various support measures have been introduced through the Unity, Resilience and Solidary Budgets. The Jobs Support Scheme is meant to provide wage support to employers to help them retain their local employees during this period of economic uncertainty. In this regard, all eligible employers who have made CPF contributions for their local employees will qualify for at least 25% wage support. In the Resilience Budget, greater support of up to 75% is provided for sectors that are more significantly and directly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, such as aviation, tourism and food services. In the Solidarity Budget, the support has gone up to 75% for all sectors for the month of April. This has since been extended to include the month of May. In addition, there are also other support for companies.  The economic linkages across firms and sectors are intricate, and hence, many firms have been affected by this unprecedented global pandemic. Some firms, as a matter of strategy, may choose to focus their businesses on a particular customer segment and may, as a result, have higher exposure to the harder-hit sectors. We appreciate the challenges that they are facing, and they can submit an appeal for a higher tier of support from the Jobs Support Scheme via IRAS' website. We will assess each appeal on its merits on a case-by-case basis. We encourage firms to take this opportunity to review their business strategies, accelerate their business transformation plans and diversify their revenue sources, as the economic landscape is changing rapidly.  "
measures to ensure safe distancing on public transport during circuit breaker period and thereafter,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Transport what are the measures to ensure safe distancing on public transport during the circuit breaker period and thereafter.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: During the current circuit breaker period, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) has implemented several safe distancing measures in the public transport network. All trains and train stations, as well as buses, bus interchanges and bus stops have been marked with safe distancing stickers, wherever practical. This includes marking out seats that should be avoided and where commuters should be standing. Public Transport Operators' (PTOs) Transport Ambassadors (TAs) and bus captains work together with LTA's enforcement officers to help commuters maintain a safe distance from one another.We also require all commuters to wear masks in the public transport network. Errant commuters may be refused entry or asked to leave. Offenders will face fines or prosecution in court.When the circuit breaker measures are lifted and commuter traffic returns, the measures will largely remain in place. The exception is that we will find it very challenging to implement safe distancing in public transport, especially during peak periods. It will therefore be very important for companies to continue to implement staggered working hours and maintain their telecommuting practices as much as possible. Commuters can also play their part to minimise discretionary travel and to travel during off-peak hours when the trains and buses are less crowded. However, we will continue to require all commuters to wear masks in the public transport network. Mask-wearing is also the practice in mass rapid transit systems in Taipei, Hong Kong and Seoul."
"update on management of covid-19 impact on employment of fresh graduates, general workforce and foreign worker dormitories","Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Manpower (a) to what extent are licensing conditions under the Foreign Employee Dormitories Act based on the Singapore Standards Council's Technical Reference 37 (2014) on the ""design, management, maintenance and operation of foreign employee dormitories""; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider updating the Technical Reference, adopting it as a Singapore Standard, and requiring all foreign workers' dormitory operators to adhere to it.","15 Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Manpower for each year in the past five years, with regard to foreign workers residing in purpose-built dormitories, factory-converted dormitories, construction temporary quarters, standalone temporary quarters, temporary quarters, quarters in buildings under construction, temporary occupation licence quarters, HDB flats, and private residential premises (a) what was the total number of foreign workers residing in each housing type; (b) how many of each housing type were there respectively; and (c) whether the Ministry will start collecting or compiling this data if it is not already doing so.16 Mr Ang Wei Neng asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how many Malaysian workers have stayed behind in Singapore after Malaysia started its movement control order on 18 March 2020; and (b) how many of these workers have returned to Malaysia after Singapore started its circuit breaker measures on 7 April 2020.17 Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether there is a significant number of Singaporeans returning from overseas and seeking jobs in the local job market in the past six months; (b) if so, whether the Ministry foresees challenges in placing these Singaporeans in the current job market and what are some of these challenges; (c) how can these challenges be overcome; and (d) whether the Ministry will consider creating specific programmes to help those who have returned to adjust to the local work environment by equipping them with the relevant skill sets and information about the local job market.18 Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Manpower in each of the past three years (a) how many offences has the Commissioner for Foreign Employee Dormitories charged operators for breaching the licensing standards for accommodation, health, safety and emergency preparedness; (b) how many compliance directives and regulatory actions have been issued respectively; and (c) whether there is any relationship between the violations and the severity of the COVID-19 outbreak at the dormitories.19 Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Manpower with regard to the Foreign Employee Dormitories Act, in each of the past three years (a) how many public officers have been appointed as Commissioner, Deputy Commissioners and Assistant Commissioners respectively; (b) whether the officers are appointed to these duties on a full-time basis; (c) how many staff have been appointed as Dormitory Inspectors; and (d) how many dormitories have been inspected and how frequently have the dormitories been inspected on average.20 Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng asked the Minister for Manpower how can the Ministry partner other stakeholders in the public, private and people sectors to seek permanent/temporary job or internship opportunities for fresh graduates in a labour market impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak.Mrs Josephine Teo: These questions have been responded to via a Ministerial Statement on 4 May 2020."
number and ratio of social workers-to-client in each family service centre in last three years and measures to cope with sudden increase in caseload in times of crisis,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) in each of the last three years, what is the number of social workers in each Family Service Centre (FSC); (b) whether this number deviates significantly from the capacity required at FSCs; (c) what is the number of clients served by each FSC; (d) what is the social worker to client ratio at each FSC; (e) what is the fluctuation in the number of clients across each quarter; and (f) whether there are policy measures to allow FSCs to cope with sudden increase in caseload, such as in times of crisis like COVID-19 or when a community suffers significant disruption due to relocation.","Mr Desmond Lee: Family Service Centres (FSCs) are community-based social services that support low-income and vulnerable individuals and families to achieve independence, stability and resilience, through social work intervention.The number of social workers in the FSCs has increased over the past few years, from 588 in 2017, 680 in 2018 and to 706 in 2019. This translates to an average of about 15 social workers per FSC in 2019, with the variance depending on the size and needs of the town it serves. FSC caseloads vary across centres and are generally stable from quarter to quarter. The FSCs see an annual average of 350 clients each, with social work practitioners managing an average caseload of 23 in 2017, 25 in 2018 and 22 in 2019. Each FSC distributes the cases among its staff according to the needs of their centre.MSF and NCSS work closely with our FSCs and Social Service Agencies (SSAs), both in normalcy and during challenging periods like COVID-19. During this period, MSF has been in regular contact with FSCs to understand their concerns, and issues advisories to FSCs on the precautionary measures to be taken to cope with the evolving situation. MSF also provides funding to FSCs based on their caseloads, with more funding provided for complex and high-risk cases. This ensures that FSCs have the resources and flexibility to hire more staff when needed. In addition to the support measures announced in the Resilience Budget, FSCs being NCSS member agencies are eligible to claim $3,000 from the Community Chest to help them cope with COVID-19-related expenses. NCSS will also support SSAs in adopting digital tools through the existing VWOs-Charities Capability Fund, and these tools can enable FSCs to continue serving clients remotely during this period. SSAs can also tap on the SG United portal to recruit volunteers to augment their manpower, to support them during this period.We will continue to work closely with the FSCs to support them and their clients during this challenging season."
"applications approved, help given through comcare to unsuccessful applicants and fraudulent applications detected for temporary relief fund as at 30 april 2020","Mr Ang Wei Neng asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) how many Singaporeans have applied for the Temporary Relief Fund (TRF) as of 30 April 2020; (b) of these, how many applications have been approved; (c) of those not approved, how many have been given help through ComCare; and (d) how many fraudulent TRF applications have been detected.","Mr Desmond Lee: The Temporary Relief Fund (TRF) sought to provide timely assistance to lower- and middle-income Singapore Citizens/Permanent Residents affected by the economic impact of COVID-19, for the month of April 2020, before other assistance schemes kicked in. Individuals who lost their jobs or faced an income loss of at least 30% due to COVID-19 could apply. As at 30 April 2020, we have received about 594,206 applications and approved 444,786 applications. The main reasons for non-approval include applicants not meeting the qualifying criteria of job loss or income loss of at least 30%, and applicants exceeding the qualifying income criteria of monthly per capita income of not more than $3,100 or gross monthly household income of not more than $10,000. TRF applicants may also apply for ComCare if they need further assistance with basic living expenses. We do not have readily available data on how many ineligible TRF applicants were subsequently provided with ComCare.  We are investigating all alleged fraudulent TRF applications. Investigations are ongoing and we do not have a confirmed number of fraudulent cases yet."
eligibility of lower and middle income singaporeans for covid-19 support grant whose employment offers were revoked due to outbreak,"Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Social and Family Development whether lower and middle-income Singaporeans who have accepted employment offers from employers only to have these offers revoked due to COVID-19 may be eligible for COVID-19 Support Grant, even though they have not commenced employment with these employers.","Mr Desmond Lee:The COVID-19 Support Grant (CSG) assists Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents who were employed but lost their jobs or are placed on involuntary no-pay-leave (NPL) for at least three consecutive months due to the impact of COVID-19. These individuals may apply for the CSG from 4 May 2020. Employees who lost at least 50% of their income for three consecutive months will also be eligible for CSG and may apply from 11 May 2020. These changes in employment or income situation should have occurred after 23 January 2020, which is when the first case of COVID-19 was detected in Singapore.Applicants should have been in full-time or part-time employment prior to being unemployed. Individuals whose employment offers were revoked before they started work or who have no valid employment contracts are not eligible for the COVID-19 Support Grant. Low-income individuals and families who need help with their basic living expenses may approach our Social Service Offices (SSOs) to apply for ComCare assistance. "
number of downloads of snapsafe app since 2017 and top three unsafe practices reported via app,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the number of downloads of the Snapsafe app since its launch in 2017; (b) how many reports have been made via the app on unsafe practices at the workplace; and (c) what are the top three unsafe practices reported via the app.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: Since its launch in December 2017, there were 20,233 downloads for the Snapsafe app.  From December 2017 till February 2020, there were 2081 reports on unsafe workplace practices via the Snapsafe app, as follows:The top three unsafe practices reported were (a) work at height with lack of fall protection measures, (b) lack of or improper use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and (c) unsafe lifting practices (e.g. using forklift as lifting equipment; unlicensed forklift driver; and improper use of cranes). MOM thanks those who report unsafe acts via Snapsafe. We take reports seriously and have taken action against 84% of investigated cases. For the remainder, there were no infringements upon inspection. Users can also use Snapsafe to report non-adherence to safe distances measures in the workplace. We encourage users to submit clear photos, including exact address and occupier name if possible, to facilitate our investigations."
cost of building cross island line and measures to ensure minimal impact on central catchment nature reserve and affordability to vulnerable populations,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the cost breakdown of the projected $40.7 billion needed to build the Cross Island Line (CRL); (b) whether the cost factors in (i) the depth of the tunnelling (ii) environmental protection and (iii) the distance difference between Options 1 and 2; (c) whether the cost includes buffers for mishaps and the cost of ensuring strict mitigation measures are being carried out for minimal to zero impact on the Central Catchment Nature Reserve; (d) whether this will mean an even higher cost of transport for public transport users since the CRL is double the cost of the Downtown Line; and (e) if so, what measures will be put in place to make the cost affordable to vulnerable populations.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Under our rail financing framework, the Government fully pays for the cost of building new rail lines. In other words, we do not recover the cost of building the Cross Island Line (CRL) from commuters through fares.The CRL project is being implemented and the final costs will depend on tender bids. It is not our practice to reveal project budget so as not to influence ongoing and future tenders. When the tender for the construction of the CRL in the vicinity of the Central Catchment Nature Reserve is called, it will clearly specify LTA's requirements for tunnel alignment and depth, as well as the environmental mitigation measures. The latter must be taken in accordance with the project's Environmental Monitoring and Management Plan (EMMP). The EMMP was rigorously studied and discussed with key stakeholders, including the Nature Groups, as part of the Environmental Impact Assessment concluded last year."
"number of liquor control zone breaches reported, liquor licences revoked and plans to further reduce number of such licences in little india",Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Home Affairs since the introduction of the Liquor Control Zone (LCZ) at Little India in 2015 (a) what has been the annual number of LCZ breaches for shops and individuals respectively; (b) what are the top three types of breaches reported; (c) how many liquor licences have been revoked; and (d) whether the police has plans to further reduce the number of liquor licences in Little India.,"Mr K Shanmugam: Within the Liquor Control Zone at Little India, there have been about 30 breaches recorded against shops and about 260 breaches recorded against individuals each year, for the past four years.The most frequent breaches are liquor consumption outside prescribed hours, public drunkenness, and the supply of liquor outside trading hours. As of 30 March 2020, Police have revoked three liquor licences in Little India.MHA's assessment is that liquor-related law and order issues are under control, and there is no need to further reduce the number of liquor licences in Little India, for now. MHA will regularly review this policy."
flexible work arrangements for frontline workers and employer support for better work-life harmony,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how can employers provide flexible work arrangements for frontline workers such as nurses, cleaners and security officers; and (b) when flexible work arrangements are not readily available for these frontline workers, how can employers support better work-life harmony for this group of workers.","Mrs Josephine Teo: The majority of companies in sectors employing nurses, cleaners and security officers are able to offer some form of flexible work arrangements (FWAs) to their employees. In 2018, between seven to nine in 10 companies in these sectors offered formal FWAs1.2Although frontline workers often have to be physically present in their workplaces, employers can still offer FWAs by way of staggering the start and end times of their shifts (i.e. flexi-time), or enabling shifts to be shared by multiple workers (i.e. flexi-load).To help more frontline workers benefit from FWAs, MOM and tripartite partners are developing sector-specific resources and employer support groups to help employers overcome challenges in offering FWAs unique to some sectors. These are in line with recommendations recently made by the Citizens' Panel (CP) on Work-Life Harmony, which comprises diverse participants including business owners and employees.As emphasised by the CP, both employers and employees have a part to play in achieving better work-life harmony. Employers and senior management need to better understand challenges faced by frontline employees, optimise work processes and enhance staff welfare. Employers should also be mindful about giving workers excessive workloads, and respect their workers' rest hours and off days. Employees, on the other hand, have to take personal responsibility in defining what they want out of their work and personal life. This will help guide them in achieving their individual work-life harmony goals."
breakdown of number of people who have stayed in crisis shelters in last three years and their profiles,"Ms Yip Pin Xiu asked the Minister for Social and Family Development in the last three years, what is the breakdown of the number of people who have lived in crisis shelters by (i) gender (ii) age (iii) marital status (iv) citizenship status and (v) length of stay.","Mr Desmond Lee: Crisis Shelters are community-based facilities that provide temporary accommodation for women and children facing violence, while the social service professionals work through safety plans and longer-term housing arrangements with them. The Crisis Shelters, funded by MSF, take in about 180 family violence cases on average each year. Each case may involve more than one client, depending on the family. The demographic profile below is based on the main female client admitted into the crisis shelter between 2017 and 2019, and does not include the male and female children of the adult client.The median age of the main female clients was 36. About seven out of 10 of them were married, and three quarters were Singapore residents.More than 90% of clients stayed less than one year, with more than one third staying less than one month."
community improvement projects committee funding applied for and allocated to each grassroots adviser and/or citizens’ consultative committee from fy2016 to date,Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for National Development how much Community Improvement Projects Committee funding was applied for and allocated to each grassroots adviser and/or Citizens' Consultative Committee from FY2016 to date.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The Community Improvement Projects Committee (CIPC) provides funding support for improvement projects in HDB estates for the benefit of local residents. Such facilities include covered walkways, footpaths, playgrounds and bicycle racks.The CIPC sets aside budget for the Citizens' Consultative Committees (CCCs) each year based on the number of HDB residential units in each constituency. The CCCs can decide how to utilise these funds for their projects, and have to raise their own funds to co-pay 10% of the project costs.As the Town Councils have to maintain the completed CIPC projects that are built on HDB common property, the CCCs also have to seek the Town Councils' agreement to maintain the infrastructure before construction work can commence.It is not meaningful to compare CIPC funding across CCCs as every constituency is different and their residents have different needs. This is why the CIPC generally lets the CCCs, who are closer to the ground, decide on the selection of the projects to best meet the needs of the residents."
applications received for letter of consent to employ ltvp/ltvp+ holder in restricted occupations and number approved and approval criteria in each of last five years,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Manpower in each of the last five years (a) how many applications have been received for a Letter of Consent to employ a LTVP/LTVP+ holder in restricted occupations such as media and religion-related occupations; (b) of these, how many applications are approved; and (c) what are the criteria for approving such applications in the areas of media and religion respectively.","Mrs Josephine Teo: In the past 5 years, MOM had received 134 Letter of Consent (LOC) applications for LTVP/ LTVP+ holders to work in the media and religion-related occupations. Most of these applications were approved.Similar to all other work passes, LOC applications, including those for media and religion related occupations, are assessed on the individual merits of the case. MOM will seek inputs from relevant government agencies before giving our approval."
average and median waiting times between adult rape victim first approaching police station and filing of first information report in each of last five years,"Ms Yip Pin Xiu asked the Minister for Home Affairs in each of the last five years, what are the average and median waiting times between when an adult victim of rape first approaches a police station and when the first information report is filed.","Mr K Shanmugam: The Singapore Police Force (SPF) does not track the time taken for a person to file a report upon arriving at a Police station.For rape cases, the victims should approach the service counters directly, and the officers will attend to them as soon as possible.SPF takes all reports of sexual assault very seriously and investigates them expeditiously."
number of transnational households with at least one singapore citizen spouse by monthly household income,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Prime Minister what is the current number of transnational households consisting of at least one Singapore citizen spouse, broken down by monthly household income.","Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): The latest available estimate is from the General Household Survey, which was conducted in 2015. Based on the survey, there were an estimated 18,700 couples comprising a Singapore Citizen (SC) married to a Non-Resident (NR) in 2015.1 The breakdown of the data by monthly household income is unavailable."
number of covid-19 tests performed and daily updates on national health statistics for comparison,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry will report the number of tests for COVID-19 conducted daily since the start of the outbreak and any additional COVID-19 related national level health statistics daily, so as to enable global health researchers to assemble internationally comparable datasets on the current state of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Ministry of Health reports the relevant COVID-19 information and statistics regularly to keep Singaporeans updated. We also share information on the number of tests conducted from time to time where relevant. To date, we have conducted more than 65,000 COVID-19 tests. An average of around 2,000 tests are conducted daily."
gender composition on corporate boards and update on council of board diversity’s latest findings and plans to achieve its 20-20 vision,Ms Yip Pin Xiu asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) why gender quotas for corporate boards are not mandatory; and (b) why the voluntary quota is set at 20% when most other countries have a higher mandatory quota.,"16 Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) whether the Council of Board Diversity's latest findings include data on how many existing board members in public-listed companies, statutory boards and IPCs hold more than two board seats across these organisations and, if not, why not; (b) what are the Ministry's plans to achieve the 20-20 vision for at least 20% female representation on boards of public-listed companies by end-2020; (c) whether there should be a higher target than 20% as a First World country; and (d) what are the Ministry's strategic plan and priorities after 2020 for achieving gender equality at home and at work.Mr Desmond Lee: The importance and benefits of having more women on boards and in senior management are well recognised. Indeed, having more women on boards adds to the boards’ diversity in skillsets, experiences and perspectives, thus leading to better decisions. However, while there has been some progress on this front, more needs to be done to quicken the pace. The Council for Board Diversity, or CBD in short, was formed by MSF in 2019 to increase the representation of women on the boards of private, people and public sectors organisations. This is an expanded scope from its predecessor, the Diversity Action Committee, or DAC, which focused on the private sector.CBD has been working towards its 2020 target of achieving 20% women on boards in the top 100 primary-listed companies. The Council has been actively engaging the Chairpersons and Board Members of these companies. To help achieve the 2020 target, MSF is also working with the Council in its engagement efforts and in building a pipeline of board-ready women candidates. The Council’s efforts include collecting data on board renewal so that it can encourage, ahead of time, the organisation concerned to nominate women candidates to be appointed. It encourages organisations, where possible, to consider creating additional positions on their boards so that we can achieve the 20% target sooner rather than wait for the renewal of existing board members.The CBD has been doing good work since it was established and it is on the way towards achieving its 20% target. We have seen an increase in women participation on the boards of the top 100 listed companies, top 100 institutions of public character (IPCs) and Government Statutory Boards. But both MSF and CBD see the need to look beyond this short-term target. As such, we should aim higher. Ultimately, boards should have an approximately equal number of men and women directors. To achieve this, CBD will gradually set higher targets as we progress. For example, CBD has set an interim target for all SGX-companies to have 25% women on boards by end-2025, and 30% women on boards by end-2030. In response to Ms Yip's point on quotas, we note that some may see mandatory quotas as a straightforward means to having more women on boards. Voluntary quotas require a lot more time and effort, as it requires changing mindsets. However, mandatory quotas would not be effective in creating a meaningful increase in the representation of women on boards, as it does not address root causes of the issue. The causes for the low percentage of women on boards are complex and intertwined. It has to do with culture and traditions. Many countries, like the United States and Denmark, face similar challenges.Thus, a multi-stakeholder approach that empowers stakeholders to collaborate and collectively address underlying root causes would be more effective. Moreover, we understand that candidates, both men and women, prefer to be appointed on their own merits, rather than being seen as mandatory 'token' representatives on boards, which would undermine their standing credibility. As the pipeline of board-ready women candidates grows and boards have more candidates to select from, there will be an organic increase in the representation of women on boards based on their own merits. Ms Anthea Ong asked whether the Council has information on how many board members are sitting on more than two boards in public listed companies, statutory boards and IPCs. I assume she is thinking of whether we can restrict the number of boards a person can sit on to allow for more people, especially women, to be appointed.  Such information is available. But I think it is better not to be too restrictive as it may not be helpful to the organic growth that we want to see in the number of women on board by having them appointed on their own merits. If a person has the capacity and the capability, he or she should not be prevented to serve on more than one board.Besides the efforts to get more women on boards, the Government also supports the multiple roles that women play in our society. Women are active in leadership positions at work and in their community. Currently, Singapore is the only ASEAN country with a female Head of State. We have three female full Ministers, several other Political Office Holders and senior Civil Servants, including Permanent Secretaries. We have 24 women Parliamentarians in this Thirteenth Parliament, which is about 24% and about the same as the Inter-Parliamentary Union’s world average of 24.5%. Women also make up half of our public service and Judicial Officers posts in the State and Supreme Courts Our approach is to empower women with choices to pursue their aspirations, be it career, family or both. As such, we will continue eliminating barriers for women at the workplace, in the community and at home. To do so, we need a whole-of-society movement to change mind-sets, attitudes and expectations. Our colleagues at the Ministry of Manpower recently announced plans to enhance the implementation of Flexible Work Arrangements, or FWAs, after hearing from the citizens' panel on work-life harmony. Apart from increasing awareness and facilitating easier adoption of FWAs, MOM will also work on shifting societal norms to make FWA more acceptable.We will continue to encourage the people, private and public sector organisations to work together towards having more women on boards and in leadership positions. "
adequacy of estimated $100 billion for coastal defences over next 100 years in view of rise in sea level from melting of antarctica,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether the estimate of $100 billion for coastal defences over the next 100 years is based on Singapore's Second National Climate Change Study released in 2015 by the Meteorological Service Singapore, which did not take into account the melting of Antarctica; (b) how much more will sea levels rise for Singapore given that Antarctica is melting with the latest scientific evidence; and (c) how much more will it cost Singapore to adapt to the increase in sea level rise due to this melting of Antarctica.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Being an island state, Singapore is vulnerable to sea level rise. Our coastal protection efforts could cost us S$100 billion over the next 50 to 100 years.The S$100 billion cost estimate was based on BCA's Coastal Adaptation Study (CAS) which was commissioned in 2013. The findings referenced the Fourth (AR4) and Fifth (AR5) Assessment Reports from the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as well as Singapore's Second National Climate Change Study published in 2015. These reports did not fully account for the ice-sheet melt in Greenland and the Antarctic as the science then was still nascent.Over the past five years, scientific understanding of this issue has developed significantly and the IPCC released a Special Report on Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) in September 2019. The SROCC found that: global warming has increased the rates of ice loss from ice-sheets and glaciers worldwide, and contributed to accelerated rise in global mean sea levels; global mean sea level is projected to rise by up to 1.1 metres in 2100 (about 0.1 metre higher than the AR5 projections); and historically rare extreme sea level events could occur at least once per year, especially in tropical regions.Scientists from the Centre for Climate Research Singapore (CCRS) have studied the SROCC findings closely and note that sea level rise in tropical areas could be up to 30% higher than the global average. As this is a complex topic, CCRS will be studying this in greater detail under the National Sea Level Research Programme (NSLP). The findings from the NSLP will provide important insights to help strengthen our defences against sea level rise. As part of the Third National Climate Change Study to be completed in 2022, CCRS will develop the new framework for future sea level projections for Singapore, making use of the upcoming Sixth Assessment Report's (AR6) climate projections. This will ensure that CCRS' sea level rise projections are robust and informed by the latest scientific knowledge.PUB, who has been tasked as the national coastal protection agency, will focus on studying our coastal areas, beginning with City-East Coast and Jurong Island, to ascertain the type, feasibility, and extent of protection measures required, and derive detailed cost estimates. To provide for the substantial capital outlay, the Government will set up a Coastal and Flood Protection Fund within PUB, with an initial S$5 billion injection.Other countries are looking at investments of similar or even greater magnitude to protect their coastlines. For example, reports have suggested that the US may need to spend more than US$400 billion between now and 2040 to defend its coastlines. The Netherlands currently commits around 1 billion Euros a year to address flood protection and water supply challenges.Climate science is constantly evolving, and projections of sea level rise will continue to change. Our coastal protection plans will need to be flexible and dynamic to be able to accommodate both future needs and the latest science. The $100 billion is an estimate that could change as science advances. This is a long-term and large-scale effort that the Government will undertake to protect Singapore and Singaporeans."
recurring dengue clusters in specific estates/areas in bukit batok east over last five years and efforts in place to contain its spread,"Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether NEA has observed recurring dengue clusters in specific estates/areas in Bukit Batok East over the last five years; (b) if so, where are these specific estates/areas; and (c) what are the efforts in place to contain the spread of dengue in these estates/areas.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Between 2015 and 2019, 41 dengue clusters were reported in Bukit Batok East division. The top areas with frequently occurring clusters in the past 5 years include the landed residential estate at Jalan Jurong Kechil / Upper Bukit Timah Road / Chun Tin Road / Yuk Tong Avenue, as well as the public housing estates at Bukit Batok East Avenue 4 / Bukit Batok East Avenue 5 and Toh Guan Road. The largest cluster of 35 dengue cases in that period was reported in the Chun Tin Road/Jalan Jurong Kechil/Yuk Tong Avenue area in November/December 2018. As of 1 April 2020, there were nine clusters in the Bukit Batok East division this year, of which five have closed. The National Environment Agency (NEA) addresses the risk of dengue transmission through a multi-pronged evidence-based approach. This is consistent across all clusters in Singapore, including Bukit Batok East. NEA conducts comprehensive surveillance of the mosquito population through its network of more than 64,000 Gravitraps. This allows NEA to target its vector control operations early and prioritise areas with higher mosquito population. NEA also adopts a preventive approach by conducting regular inspections for potential mosquito breeding habitats, and taking enforcement action against premises owners found to be breeding mosquitoes. NEA works closely with members of the Inter-Agency Dengue Task Force (IADTF), including Town Councils, to step up vector control operations in dengue cluster areas. Dengue cluster alert banners and posters are also put up at the lift lobbies of HDB blocks to heighten residents' awareness on the dengue situation. Residents living in cluster areas are urged to co-operate with NEA officers to allow them to carry out checks for mosquito breeding habitats. Residents can also apply mosquito repellent to protect themselves from mosquito bites, and spray insecticide in dark corners within their homes to kill adult mosquitoes. Since 2019, NEA has published, on the NEA website and myENV app, information on areas with relatively higher Aedes aegypti mosquito population. In February 2020, a total of 103 areas were detected with higher Aedes aegypti mosquito population by NEA's Gravitraps Surveillance System, including one in the Bukit Batok East division. Residents of Bukit Batok East and members of the public are encouraged to subscribe to the notification on dengue clusters and areas with higher Aedes aegypti mosquito population in the myENV app, and do their part to stem dengue transmission.NEA has ongoing educational and publicity campaigns to promote community action to prevent dengue transmission. The annual National Dengue Prevention Campaign was launched on 22 March 2020, to rally the community to fight dengue ahead of the traditional mid-year peak dengue season. NEA also launched the SG Clean campaign to galvanise collective community action to keep our public spaces clean. The SG Clean campaign, which calls on members of public to adopt good public and personal hygiene habits, goes hand in hand with our fight against dengue. For instance, throwing litter into trash bins, to remove potential mosquito breeding habitats. NEA alone cannot prevent dengue transmission in Singapore. NEA has observed a 50% increase in Aedes aegypti mosquito larval breeding habitats found in homes over the past three years, compared to the preceding three years. There is hence an urgent need for all stakeholders and home owners to step up their efforts to eradicate mosquito breeding habitats. Everyone must do their part to protect themselves and their loved ones from dengue."
tripartite standard on gender-equal workplace practices to require companies to adopt regular audits of employee wages to ensure gender parity and adequate female representation in key positions,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Ministry will consider introducing a Tripartite Standard on Gender-Equal Workplace Practices that requires companies to adopt practices such as regular audits of employee wages to ensure gender parity and adequate female representation in key leadership positions.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: MOM has continually adopted policies to encourage fair employment practices that support men and women in our diverse workforce. While well-intended, instituting a Tripartite Standard on Gender-Equal Workplace Practices may not lead to the desired outcomes of gender wage parity or greater representation of females in key leadership positions. Instead, there may be some unintended consequences.For instance, audits of gender pay gaps may lead to firms hesitating to employ lower-wage women as they try to avoid widening gender pay gaps. This could then restrict opportunities for many women in rank and file jobs. Rather than impose a Standard, we need to address the underlying reasons for gender pay gaps and low female representation in leadership roles. One of the root causes lies in current social norms or gender roles. In Asian families, women typically take on the primary role of caring for their children and elderly persons. This affects the amount of time women can spend at work and the extent of their work experience, and hence it impacts their career progression and earnings.Therefore, our policies aim to achieve a more balanced share of caregiving responsibilities by men and women. To reach this goal, we spur the adoption of flexible working arrangements, or FWAs, through the Tripartite Standard on FWAs and Work-Life Grant so that they can better manage their work responsibilities and at the same time fulfil family and personal aspirations. With FWAs, women are better supported to remain in the workforce, gain work experience, earn higher wages and assume leadership roles. In addition, to increase the board representation of women, the Council for Board Diversity, started by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), actively engages Chairpersons and Board Members of private and public sector organisations to encourage the appointment of women candidates.  We have seen encouraging results thus far. Singapore’s adjusted gender pay gap narrowed from 8.8% in 2002 to 6% in 2018. Our women's participation on the boards of the top 100 listed companies increased from 15.2% in 2018 to 16.2% last year.As a society, adjusting social norms can also help men and women achieve greater parity in their roles at home and at work, which is key to reaching greater wage parity and more female representation in key leadership roles."
default arrangement for fathers taking paternity leave in any combination within 12 months after birth of child without mutual agreement from employer,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Prime Minister whether the Ministry will change the default arrangement of taking paternity leave so that fathers can split the two weeks of paternity leave into working days and take them in any combination within 12 months after the birth of the child without mutual agreement from the employer.,"Mrs Josephine Teo (for the Prime Minister): Fathers play an important role in their children's care and development, as partners to their wives in raising the family. The default arrangement to consume two weeks of paternity leave within 16 weeks after delivery allows fathers to play their part in caring for their newborns, during this time when the family's caregiving load is higher. Without this default arrangement, it may be difficult for fathers to be excused from work for an extended period. The consumption of parental leave in a continuous block soon after birth is also practised in other countries such as France, Spain and the United Kingdom. For those who wish to take it flexibly, the two weeks of paternity leave can already be taken in days within a year from the child's birth, if there is mutual agreement with their employers. This arrangement recognises that fathers have different work arrangements, and balances support for fathers to take their leave flexibly with employers' manpower needs. Beyond leave provisions, the Government encourages and provides support for employers to implement the Tripartite Standards on Flexible Work Arrangements (FWAs) and Unpaid Leave for Unexpected Care Needs, to develop a more family-friendly work culture. Parents may tap on such arrangements to care for their children as well.  We will continue to work with tripartite partners to encourage companies to better support parents in managing their work and family responsibilities, including being understanding when fathers take paternity leave for their caregiving needs."
effect of malaysia’s lockdown on public transport operations in singapore and measures to minimise disruptions and ensure optimisation of resources and cost efficiency,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Transport (a) how will our public transport be affected by the lockdown of Malaysia since almost all operators employ Malaysians who commute to work in Singapore daily; (b) whether there will be measures targeted for affected operators so as to minimise disruption to our public transport system; (c) whether ridership has been affected due to an increasing number of people working from home; and (d) how are operators ensuring the optimisation of resources and cost-efficiency during this challenging period.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Malaysia's Movement Control Order has so far not affected our public transport services drastically. First, the number of public transport workers who remain in Malaysia is a very small proportion of the public transport workforce. Most chose to stay and work in Singapore. Second, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and the public transport operators worked overnight to adjust the duty rosters promptly, to respond to the sudden announcement.Since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, public transport ridership has fallen by more than 30%. This is due to individuals and companies responding to Government’s safe distancing measures, which include telecommuting and minimising discretionary travel.As the situation is still evolving, we will continue to work closely with public transport operators to better match supply with demand. If intensified safe distancing measures result in a significant dip in ridership, we will adjust bus and rail capacity, to optimise resource allocation. But we will do this carefully, to allow buses and trains to remain less crowded during this extraordinary period."
private bus operations and ridership in 2018 and 2019 and their contribution to total carbon emissions and measures to achieve goals of land transport masterplan 2040,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the total number of private bus operators, private buses, private bus trips and passengers, including tourists, NS men, workers, students in 2018 and 2019; (b) what is the total carbon emission contribution from these private bus trips per year; and (c) how and when will the Ministry begin supporting private buses and coaches to become cleaner to complement the goal of 100% clean energy public bus fleets as part of Land Transport Masterplan 2040 and Singapore's overall commitment to climate change.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: There are around 5,000 private bus operators with a combined fleet of 13,500 private buses. As we do not track the number of private bus trips and passengers, we do not have data on their carbon emissions.The Government announced its vision for all vehicles to run on cleaner energy by 2040 and is committed to supporting efforts by private bus operators to adopt cleaner vehicle models for their fleets. From 1 April 2021, they will be able to benefit from the Commercial Vehicle Emissions Scheme (CVES) and an enhanced Early Turnover Scheme (ETS). Under the CVES, private bus operators who choose lower emissions alternatives for their private buses with maximum laden weight not exceeding 3.5 tonnes can enjoy an incentive of up to $30,000. The enhanced ETS will further encourage turnover of older diesel commercial vehicles, including buses, to newer and cleaner models.Separately, the Government will also work with the private sector to increase charging infrastructure provisions at public and private carparks island-wide. This will support greater adoption of electric buses."
factors that led to higher percentage of eligible fathers in public sector taking paternity leave compared to private sector,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Prime Minister (a) what are the factors that have led to a higher percentage of eligible fathers in the public sector taking their paternity leave as compared to the private sector; and (b) how will the Ministry help the private sector achieve a higher uptake of paternity leave.,"Mrs Josephine Teo (for the Prime Minister):  A study commissioned by the National Population and Talent Division in 2019 found that most fathers in Singapore want to use their paternity leave and play a bigger role in child-raising. However, across different types of jobs and companies, a key factor affecting fathers’ utilisation of paternity leave is workplace support from supervisors and colleagues.  The healthy social norm in the Public Service where the majority of fathers (84%) already take paternity leave is self-reinforcing: it helps fathers feel assured about taking paternity leave, and contributes to the high take-up rates in the public sector.1 One of the key reasons for this social norm is that fathers from the public sector generally have supervisors and colleagues who are supportive of them taking paternity leave. A whole-of-society effort is needed to support fathers to be more active in parenting, and to take time-off from work to spend time with their children. We will continue to work with tripartite partners, employers and community partners, to strengthen attitudes and norms in support of fathers taking paternity leave to care for their children."
proposal to provide a set of guidelines and encourage hawkers to refrain from practices that cause contamination risks,"Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources as part of the SG Clean campaign, whether the Ministry will provide a set of guidelines and encourage our hawkers to refrain from practices that cause contamination risks.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: All hawkers are licensed by the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) and are required to comply with licensing conditions and regulatory requirements. These include maintaining and cleaning their stalls regularly, and having proper infrastructure in place to safely prepare, handle and sell food. Hawkers and their assistants who handle food must also pass the Basic Food Hygiene Course, which equips them with relevant food safety and hygiene knowledge, including proper food handling and good personal hygiene practices. SFA conducts regular inspections to ensure that the regulations are adhered to. The National Environment Agency (NEA) also encourages best practices for the cleaning of hawker centres, such as the use of two separate cloths for table cleaning, as well as sanitising and soaking of cleaning cloths in household bleach at the correct concentration according to manufacturer's instructions. Following the SARS episode in 2003, NEA has also instituted quarterly ""spring cleaning"" for all hawker centres, where hawkers are required to clean up their stalls and the centre is closed for thorough cleaning, such as high pressure jet-wash of the whole centre and cleaning of hard-to-reach surfaces.When COVID-19 cases were first detected in Singapore, NEA and SFA issued joint advisories and stepped up engagement efforts to food establishments, including hawker centres and hawker stalls, to ramp up cleaning efforts and safeguard public health. Last month, the national SG Clean campaign was launched to rally all Singaporeans to keep Singapore clean. As part of the campaign, NEA and SFA introduced sanitation and hygiene checklists for hawker centres and stalls which highlight key practices to safeguard hygiene and reduce contamination risks. Practices include regular cleaning of premises, especially frequent touch points or heavily soiled areas, and sanitisation of food preparation surfaces, utensils and cooking equipment. Hawker centres and stalls that adhere to the checklists will be awarded the ""SG Clean"" quality mark. To date, 19 hawker centres and one in five hawker stalls have been certified ""SG Clean"". We will audit all hawker centres and stalls for the ""SG Clean"" quality mark standards by this year.Every Singaporean must also play our part to keep Singapore clean in our battle against COVID-19. As individuals, we should continue to practise good personal hygiene and responsibility like frequent handwashing and temperature monitoring. As a community, we need to exercise social responsibility and collectively keep our premises clean and pest-free to reduce the spread of diseases and viruses. I encourage all Singaporeans to practise the ""7 Habits of Good Public Hygiene"":1) Keep premises clean and pest-free;2) Return trays and keep table clean;3) Keep toilet clean and dry;4) Wash hands regularly with soap;5) Take temperature and see doctor if unwell;6) Use tissues when sneezing or coughing; and7) Bin litter and soiled tissue."
proposal for all pre-schools to have at least one lactation room,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what percentage of preschools currently have at least one lactation room; and (b) whether the Ministry can make it compulsory for all preschools to have at least one lactation room.,"Mr Desmond Lee: The Early Childhood Development Agency does not require all preschools to have a lactation room within their premises. Preschools have the flexibility to manage the use of their space, depending on the needs of their children, staff and parents. For preschools with older children (for example kindergartens) and preschools with more working mothers, the need for a lactation room within the centre itself may be less pressing. For others, we encourage preschools to consider setting up a lactation room or making space arrangements for breastfeeding, as and when the need arises. In general, preschools should ensure efficient use of space for child development and staff welfare, based on their needs of their children and staff. "
proposal for all mrt stations and bus interchanges to have at least one lactation room and breastfeeding room,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Transport (a) what percentage of MRT stations and bus interchanges currently have at least one lactation room and breastfeeding room; and (b) whether the Ministry can make it compulsory for all MRT stations and bus interchanges to have at least one lactation room and breastfeeding room.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: There are nursing rooms at 50% of our bus interchanges. We will provide nursing rooms at all new bus interchanges and integrated transport hubs. For the MRT network, we will provide nursing rooms at all new interchange stations. We will also explore providing such facilities when MRT stations undergo upgrading.Not all MRT stations and bus interchanges need to be provided with nursing rooms as many of them are adjacent to major developments with nursing rooms, such as shopping centres and libraries. This is a balanced approach, to avoid duplication while meeting the needs of nursing mothers. "
trend observed in audienceship for annual singapore international festival of arts,"Mr Terence Ho Wee San asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) what is the trend observed in the audienceship for the annual Singapore International Festival of Arts; and (b) how can the audienceship be improved.","Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: Singapore International Festival of Arts (SIFA) shifted to a more compact model in 2018 under Festival Director Gaurav Kripalani. All events happen over three consecutive weekends to generate more buzz, instead of four months in the past. The average attendance for the past two editions has been about 50,000 attendees each year. SIFA's strength in curating and showcasing high-quality artistic works has culminated in a 17% increase in returning visitors to SIFA in 2019 as compared to the previous year based on audiences surveyed.As articulated by the National Arts Council in Our SG Arts Plan (2018 to 2022), growing audiences is a key priority area for the development of Singapore's arts landscape. For SIFA, close to half (47%) of the audiences surveyed last year were first time patrons, of which 70% were Singapore residents – this is heartening and we would like to see more Singaporeans attend SIFA or an arts event. SIFA will continue to present interesting programmes and experiences that can reach people from all backgrounds to attend this national event. SIFA will also keep tickets affordable to break down barriers of entry. For example, it offered a $10 Front Row Student Special to attract the younger audiences.SIFA seeks to look at audience development holistically and explore different ways to reach audiences, such as bringing the arts out into our public spaces. It held performances in unconventional spaces such as the Armenian Church and the National Library at Bras Basah to attract new audiences.Participative arts has also been another way to engage more audiences, such as SIFA 2019's De Relaxeratte (which invited audiences to journey on a merry-go-round of hammocks as they listen to stories with headphones) and We can Dance had audiences learning dance steps, and their experiences were then filmed and projected for a larger community to enjoy."
breakdown by gender and current employment status of singaporeans eligible for budget 2020 matched retirement savings scheme and average and median balances in cpf accounts,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Manpower in respect of the estimated 435,000 Singaporeans eligible for the Budget 2020 Matched Retirement Savings Scheme (a) what is the breakdown by (i) gender and (ii) current employment status; and (b) what are the average and median balances in their CPF accounts, also broken down by gender and current employment status.","Mrs Josephine Teo: The Matched Retirement Savings Scheme, or MRSS, helps Singaporeans aged 55 to 70 who have yet to meet the CPF Basic Retirement Sum to save more for retirement. This can include lower- to middle-income seniors, and in particular, caregivers and self-employed persons (SEPs) who typically have less in their CPF.  By fully utilising the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme, members can increase their Retirement Account balances by more than $6,000 over five years, which can result in up to an $80 increase in their CPF LIFE payout per month.About half of those eligible for MRSS are active CPF contributors, with slightly more women than men among them. On average, eligible and active CPF contributors who are women have $108,000 in their Ordinary, Special and Retirement Accounts combined, including amounts withdrawn under the Investment, Education and Housing schemes. At the median, it is $90,000. Among eligible active CPF contributors who are men, the average and median balances are $146,000 and $133,000 respectively.About one-third of those eligible for MRSS are inactive CPF contributors (likely to be full-time care-givers), with 2.5 times as many women as men among them. On average, eligible but inactive CPF contributors who are women have $60,000 in their Ordinary, Special and Retirement Accounts combined, including amounts withdrawn under the Investment, Education and Housing schemes. At the median, it is $39,000. Among eligible inactive CPF contributors who are men, the average and median balances are $96,000 and $63,000 respectively.About 20% of those eligible for MRSS are SEPs who have lower CPF contribution obligation. For comparison, 8% to 10% of our workforce are SEPs. In this group, there are twice as many men as women. On average, eligible SEP contributors who are women have $72,000 in their Ordinary, Special and Retirement Accounts combined, including amounts withdrawn under the Investment, Education and Housing schemes. At the median, it is $48,000. Among eligible SEP contributors who are men, the average and median balances are $113,000 and $88,000 respectively."
"number and breakdown of households under public rental scheme, interim rental housing scheme and parenthood provisional housing scheme","Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for National Development (a) how many households currently live in HDB's rental flats under the (i) Public Rental Scheme (ii) Interim Rental Housing Scheme and (iii) Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme respectively; (b) how many of these rental flats house more than one nuclear household, broken down by housing scheme; (c) how many applicants under the Joint Single Scheme are unable to secure a rental flat due to difficulty in finding a suitable person to rent with; and (d) how many rental flats house (i) 3 persons (ii) 4 persons (iii) 5 persons (iv) 6 persons and (v) more than 6 persons, broken down by (i) 1-room (ii) 2-room (iii) 3-room and (iv) 4-room flats respectively.","Mr Lawrence Wong: About 52,000 households currently live in rental flats under the various HDB rental schemes, of which about 50,000 households are under the Public Rental Scheme.Around 70 rental flats are occupied by more than one nuclear household. This means that they are able to form more than one family nucleus comprising one Singapore Citizen (SC) and another SC or Singapore Permanent Resident (SPR). Those under the Public Rental Scheme may rent separate flats, subject to each household meeting the prevailing eligibility conditions for the Public Rental Scheme.85% of households with at least three persons are living in 2-room or larger rental flats under the various HDB rental schemes. For the households residing in 1-room rental flats, some may not have been able to retain their larger flats due to arrears.HDB does not track the number of applicants under the Joint Single Scheme who are unable to secure a rental flat due to difficulty in finding a suitable co-applicant. Singles looking to apply for a rental flat under the Joint Singles Scheme are encouraged to find someone they know to be their co-applicant, such as a relative or a friend. For those who need help to find a co-applicant, HDB will assist by offering them a listing of single persons who are also looking for a possible pairing. HDB also conducts facilitated sessions to help the singles on the list find a flatmate."
emphasis on local arts scene in singapore international festival of arts 2020,"Mr Terence Ho Wee San asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) whether there is enough emphasis on the local arts scene in the Singapore International Festival of Arts 2020 (SIFA); and (b) what percentage of the programmes and productions presented are from overseas.","Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: The National Arts Council (NAC) believes Singapore International Festival of Arts (SIFA) as our pinnacle arts festival, should be a platform for Singaporean arts groups to create exciting new works. It seeks to profile and open up opportunities for local arts practitioners as a highlight in our cultural calendar. In the past two years, half of all productions and programmes at SIFA involve local artists. This will continue to be the case for future SIFA editions.NAC has decided to cancel SIFA 2020 in view of the current challenges posed by COVID-19."
breakdown on number of persons above age 65 receiving cpf transfers from their child in last three years,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Manpower in each year of the last three years (a) how many persons above the age of 65 received a CPF transfer from their child (i) in cash and (ii) through CPF; and (b) what is the average transfer quantum received among such persons, broken down by the children's and the parents' (i) age (ii) gender and (iii) income, and the modes of transfer by cash and CPF including the amounts.","Mrs Josephine Teo: The number of recipients above age 65 receiving Retirement Sum top-ups from their children increased to about 17,800 in 2019, with more than $169 million received. Tables 1 to 4 show that: (a) The number of unique recipients increased slightly; (b) Cash top-ups are more popular; (c) Female recipients receive more than males; and (d) Givers who earn less, top up more in cash than those who earn more. To further encourage members to make top-ups for themselves and their loved ones, the Government will introduce the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme (MRSS) from 2021 to 2025. Under MRSS, the Government will match every dollar of cash top-ups, up to an annual cap of $600, made to eligible members under RSTU. "
licence fee payments made by dog farms and pet shops in 2018 and 2019 under animals and birds (dog licensing rules),"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for National Development for the nine licence fee categories in Part II and Part III of the First Schedule of the Animal and Birds (Dog Licensing Rules), how many (i) dog farms and (ii) pets shops respectively, have paid the licence fee in (i) 2018 and (ii) 2019 respectively under each category.",Mr Lawrence Wong: Table 1 provides the number of dog farms that paid annual licence fees for dogs kept for breeding at their premises under Part II of the First Schedule of the Animals and Birds (Dog Licensing and Control) Rules.Table 2 provides the number of dog farms and pet shops that paid annual licence fees for dogs kept for sale at their premises under Part III of the First Schedule of the Animals and Birds (Dog Licensing and Control) Rules.
plans to expand green bond grant scheme with stricter regulations,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Prime Minister whether there are plans to expand the Green Bond Grant Scheme with stricter regulations to ensure the adherence to the Scheme's definition of eligible expenses.,"Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): The MAS' Green Bond Grant Scheme was launched three years ago to catalyse the green bond market in Singapore. To-date, more than SGD 6.5 billion of green bonds have been issued in Singapore.Over the years, we monitored the take-up of the grant, reviewed and refined the scheme. In February 2019, MAS lowered the minimum issuance size from SGD 200 million to SGD 20 million to support more issuers, including medium-sized enterprises. MAS also expanded the scope of the scheme to include social and sustainability bonds and renamed it the Sustainable Bond Grant Scheme. Even with changes to the scheme, issuers of green bonds are still required to have in place a green bond framework based on internationally accepted principles – governing the use of proceeds, the evaluation and selection of projects, and reporting on the allocation of proceeds to eligible projects. Issuers are also required to obtain independent external reviews1 to assure investors that their frameworks are robust and not subject to ""greenwashing"", where unsubstantiated or false claims on the environmental contribution of one's products, services or business activities are made. To further reduce greenwashing risks, more work needs to be done globally to develop common standards and definitions, as well as to enhance disclosure and reporting. Beyond green bonds, having access to a wider range of sustainability financing options would facilitate SMEs' adoption of sustainable business practices. MAS is thus looking into developing a grant scheme for green and sustainability-linked loans, which could potentially be more relevant to SMEs as the loan proceeds can be used for general corporate purposes so long as borrowers meet relevant sustainability metrics. MAS will calibrate the minimum qualifying loan amount to better meet the needs of SMEs."
study on impact and mitigation factors of climate change on low-income groups,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Prime Minister (a) whether the National Climate Change Secretariat has conducted a study on the impact and mitigation factors of climate change on low-income groups; (b) if so, what are the results of the study; and (c) if not, whether it will consider conducting such a study.","Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): Our strategies for climate action take into account the needs of all stakeholders, including the low-income and the vulnerable. Our range of adaptation and mitigation measures is designed to be inclusive. The measures aim to minimise the adverse effects that climate change could have on the economy, society and on our daily lives.For example, the Government has been improving the liveability of our public housing estates through novel ways of weaving greenery into our estates and towns, which reduces temperatures while improving air quality. HDB flats are also designed to maximise cross-ventilation, thereby reducing reliance on air-conditioning which is a large contributor to household utility bills. The recently announced HDB Green Towns Programme will further enable reduction in energy consumption and cool our HDB towns. These sustainability measures ensure that the impact of climate change on all residents, including low-income groups, are minimised.The Government also ensures that cost of mitigation measures is minimised for households. As recently announced, the Government will introduce incentives to support lower-income households in purchasing more energy efficient appliances. To help households adjust to the impact of the carbon tax on their electricity and gas expenses, eligible HDB households are given an additional $20 GST Voucher – U-Save on top of the regular U-Save rebate each year from 2019 to 2021. Eligible households living in smaller HDB flats benefit more as they receive a larger quantum of U-Save rebates, and typically have smaller annual utilities bills."
singaporeans under 21 years of age residing in singapore with non-pr foreign parent,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) how many Singaporeans who are under 21 years of age reside in Singapore currently with a foreign parent who has not been given PR status; and (b) since 2016, how many of these non-PR foreign parents are (i) women (ii) sole supporters of their Singaporean child, having been separated, divorced or widowed from their citizen spouse and (iii) persons who have left Singapore with their Singaporean child to reside elsewhere following the expiry of their Long-Term Visit Pass or other visit passes.","Mr K Shanmugam: As at 31 December 2019, about 13,400 Singapore Citizen (SC) children under the age of 21 had foreign parents who were residing in Singapore on either a Long-Term Visit Pass (LTVP) or a Work Pass.Based on ICA's records from 2016 to 2019, there were around 14,400 unique non-PR foreign parents with SC children under the age of 21 who applied for LTVPs.Of these 14,400 parents, around 12,100 of them were female. Among this group, only 1.5% or 177 of them were widowed, divorced or separated. Seven did not eventually qualify for long-term stay through an immigration or employment facility. As at 24 February 2020, the SC children of these seven were still residing in Singapore."
number of cases requiring an assistant registrar to sign documents for sale of matrimonial property due to refusal by spouse to sign sale documents,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Law for each year of the past five years (a) how many cases has an Assistant Registrar been required to sign on documents for the sale of the matrimonial property because of refusal by the spouse to sign the sale documents; (b) for these applications, what is the average and mean duration of the Assistant Registrar's signing from the date of the initial order requiring the sale of the matrimonial home; (c) what is the average and mean number of previous applications also involving such non-compliance by the spouse to sign the sale documents; and (d) if such data is not currently collected, whether the Ministry will consider collecting such data.","Mr K Shanmugam: Currently, the data referred to in (a), (b), and (c) is not collected.In relation to (b), the time between the Registrar's signing of documents to effect the surrender, sale, or transfer of the matrimonial property and the making of the initial court order depends on the facts of the case, including the actual terms of the initial court order. Where the application is approved, the relevant documents are signed on the same day.We will explore with the Courts if they are able to collect such data."
number of court applications involving spouse refusing to comply with court orders on sale of matrimonial home in the past five years,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Law for each year of the past five years (a) what is the number of court applications involving a spouse who refuses to comply with court orders pertaining to the sale of the matrimonial home; (b) for these applications, what is the average and mean duration of the application from the date of the initial order requiring the sale of the matrimonial home; (c) what is the average and mean number of previous applications also involving such non-compliance by the spouse; and (d) if such data is not currently collected, whether the Ministry will consider collecting such data.","Mr K Shanmugam: Currently, the data referred to in (a), (b), and (c) are not collected.In relation to (b), the time between the making of the initial order and the enforcement or variation of that order depends on the facts of the case, including the terms of the initial order, the circumstances of that case, and when the party concerned decides to make the application. We will explore with the Courts if they are able to collect such data."
number of children granted singapore citizenship born to pr mothers and non-pr mothers each year since 2016,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Home Affairs in each year since 2016, how many children granted Singapore citizenship have been born to (i) mothers with permanent resident (PR) status and (ii) foreign mothers without PR status respectively.","Mr K Shanmugam: From 2016 to 2019, an average of around 4,280 citizen children were born in Singapore each year to mothers who were Permanent Residents (PRs). For the same period, an average of around 2,210 citizen children were born to foreign mothers who were not PRs."
"requiring association support for companies' applications to recruit process, construction and maintenance work permit holders","Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Manpower what is the rationale and intent of requiring the Association of Process Industries (ASPRI) to support a company's application to recruit Process, Construction and Maintenance (PCM) work permit holders.","Mrs Josephine Teo: Contractors in the Process Construction and Maintenance (or ""PCM"") industry require specialised skills and expertise to build and maintain process plants.In January 2000, MOM enlisted ASPRI's help to verify the business nature and activities of PCM contractors so that only suitably qualified contractors are granted access to foreign workers. The association is well placed to do so given its specialist knowledge of the sector. Upon successful verification, the contractors submit work pass applications directly to MOM without ASPRI's involvement."
grounds of rejection in request to hire foreign domestic worker,Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Manpower what are the grounds that the Ministry uses to reject (i) an employer's request to hire a foreign domestic worker and (ii) an employment agency's application to place a foreign domestic worker.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: The reasons for rejecting foreign domestic worker (FDW) applications are the same whether they are made by employers or their employment agents. The main reasons are unacceptable accommodation for the FDW, the employer having no or unstable income or the FDW being over the age limit."
number of households hiring at least two domestic workers in last three years,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Manpower in each year of the last three years (a) how many households have hired at least two domestic workers, disaggregated by the number of domestic workers; and (b) of these households, how many consist of at least one person above the age of 65.","Mrs Josephine Teo: From 2017 to 2019, an average of 14,000 households per year hired at least two foreign domestic workers (FDWs). Half of these households have at least one person who is aged 65 or older."
support for children aged below seven with developmental needs to secure preschool placements,Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Social and Family Development since the shift of early intervention services from MSF Disability Office to Early Childhood Development Agency (a) how many children aged below 7 with developmental needs have been (i) declined for enrolments or (ii) expelled by preschools; and (b) how is the Early Childhood Development Agency supporting families with children with developmental needs secure preschool placements.,"Mr Desmond Lee: Today, many young children with developmental needs are enrolled in a preschool. Three-quarters of children aged five to six who are enrolled in the Early Intervention Programme for Infants & Children (EIPIC) are also enrolled in preschools.There is a range of support available within preschools for children with developmental needs. For example, about 550 preschools offer the Learning Support and Development Support programmes, which cater to children with learning and mild developmental needs respectively. However, some preschools may find it challenging to cater to a child with moderate to severe developmental needs. The Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) receives feedback on a few such cases per year. Where needed, ECDA works with parents and stakeholders such as SG Enable, EIPIC centres and preschools to find a solution that meets the needs of the child. This includes engaging the parents and the preschools to better understand the child's needs, and arranging for the preschools to work with EIPIC centres to adopt appropriate strategies to support the child. ECDA may also refer the child to suitable preschools which are better placed to support the child’s development. The Government is continuing to enhance support for children with developmental needs in preschools. For example, we introduced the Development Support-Plus (DS-Plus) programme last year to cater to children who have made sufficient progress under EIPIC and are able to transit to receiving intervention in a preschool setting with added support. Under DS-Plus, early intervention professionals from EIPIC centres work with the child in his or her preschool up to twice a week, co-teaching the child alongside the preschool teacher. We have also set up the Inclusive Preschool Workgroup, which will develop recommendations on how to better support children with moderate to severe developmental needs in preschools."
efforts made to investigate open cases against four companies under transboundary haze pollution act initiated in 2015,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether, and to what extent, efforts are still being made to investigate the open cases against four companies under the Transboundary Haze Pollution Act initiated in 2015; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider giving whistleblowers some financial incentives to provide information leading to successful investigation and prosecution.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Singapore enacted the Transboundary Haze Pollution Act (THPA) in 2014 to send a strong signal that we will not tolerate the irresponsible actions of errant companies, whether Singapore-based or otherwise, that harm our environment. In 2015, NEA issued legal notices under the THPA to six companies to take immediate measures to stop the fires that caused haze that affected Singapore. Two of the companies responded and explained that they were no longer associated with the affected lands. Upon further investigation, NEA accepted their explanation and closed these two cases. The cases against the other four companies are still open. If the directors of the relevant companies enter Singapore, they will be required to assist in our investigations. Action will also be taken against one of the directors who has an outstanding court warrant against him.The THPA is not a panacea or the only tool to fight transboundary haze. Although none of the investigated companies has been prosecuted yet, the THPA has nevertheless put added pressure on companies to behave responsibly. We have no plans to offer financial incentives to whistle blowers at this moment."
measures to assist self-employed tourist excursion bus owners impacted by covid-19,Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether there are any measures to assist the self-employed tourist excursion bus owners who are directly impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak and whether the Point-to-Point Support Package can also be extended to them in some form.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: The $4 billion Stabilisation and Support Package announced in Budget 2020 provides broad-based as well as targeted support for workers and enterprises affected by COVID-19 outbreak.Tourist bus owners, including sole proprietors (i.e. self-employed tourist excursion bus owners), are eligible to apply for the Temporary Bridging Loan Programme (TBLP). TBLP provides additional cash flow support, allowing eligible enterprises to borrow up to $1 million, with the interest rate capped at 5% p.a. from participating financial institutions. Those that hire local workers are also eligible for manpower support, such as the Jobs Support Scheme. We have received feedback that self-employed private hire bus owners which cater to tourist groups may require additional support, and are studying how we can help them. "
number of foreign domestic workers repatriated back to their home countries before finishing a two-year contract,Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Manpower in each year of the last three years (a) how many foreign domestic workers have been repatriated back to their home countries before finishing a two-year contract; (b) what are the top three reasons for their repatriation; and (c) how many of those repatriated are hired by an employer in Singapore within six months of their repatriation.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: Over the past three years, about 20% of foreign domestic workers (FDWs), or 49,000 FDWs, in Singapore return home without completing their contract each year. Of these FDWs, about 20% return to Singapore to work as an FDW within six months.The common reasons for FDWs to return to their home countries before the end of contract include: (i) family exigencies back home; (ii) employer found the FDW not suitable for the household; and (iii) FDW did not wish to continue working in Singapore."
steps taken to encourage schools and centralised institutes to achieve at least bca green mark gold certification,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for National Development what steps will the Ministry take to encourage more primary schools, secondary schools, mixed-level schools, junior colleges and centralised institutes to achieve at least the BCA Green Mark Gold certification.","Mr Lawrence Wong: MOE and BCA have been working together on many infrastructural improvements and upgrades over the years for more Government and Government-Aided schools to meet Green Mark Gold standards. Of 332 such schools, 115 have attained at least a Green Mark Gold certification to date. The aim is to have the remaining schools achieve this certification by early 2025."
percentages of public sector buildings certified as bca green mark gold plus and bca green mark gold,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for National Development what percentages of public sector buildings, excluding schools, with air-conditioned floor areas of (i) at least 10,000 sqm and (ii) at least 5,000 sqm and less than 10,000 sqm, are respectively certified as BCA Green Mark Gold Plus and BCA Green Mark Gold.","Mr Lawrence Wong: As of December 2019, close to 70% of public sector buildings with air-conditioned floor area of 10,000 square metres or more, excluding schools, have attained the Green Mark Gold Plus certification. 60% of public sector buildings with gross floor area exceeding 5,000 square metres but with air-conditioned floor area below 10,000 square metres, excluding schools, have attained the Green Mark Gold certification."
consideration to evaluate battery-swapping as alternative to charging for electric vehicles charging points,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Trade and Industry in respect of the target of 28,000 charging points for electric vehicles, whether the Ministry is evaluating battery-swapping as an alternative to charging.","Mr Chan Chun Sing: Yes, the Ministry is exploring battery swapping as a complement to charging. The efficacy of battery swapping, along with technological progress in electric vehicles (EVs) and the charging infrastructure, will influence the final design of the EV charging network."
consideration to create a singapore carbon agreement,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether the Ministry will consider creating a Singapore Carbon Agreement to facilitate the exchange of best practices for emission reductions across the 23 major sectors of Singapore's economy following the model of tripartite collaborations like the Singapore Packaging Agreement.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Singapore's Climate Action Plan outlines our climate mitigation strategies across key sectors – namely, the power, industry, transport, buildings, households, and waste and water sectors. Improving energy efficiency is a key strategy that not only contributes to emission reductions, but also enhances companies' long-term business competitiveness.The Energy Efficiency National Partnership (EENP) launched by the National Environment Agency (NEA) in 2010, aims to support companies in their energy efficiency efforts. The EENP is a voluntary, industry-focused programme, in partnership with the NEA, the Economic Development Board and the Energy Market Authority. As of January 2020, 302 companies have joined the programme. As part of the EENP's learning network, NEA organises the biennial National Energy Efficiency Conference. Companies, organisations and individuals are also recognised for their achievements in energy management through the annual EENP Awards. These platforms allow companies to share best practices and promote the adoption of energy efficient technologies. The Government also works closely with industry-led work groups such as the Singapore Chemical Industry Council Industry Sustainability Committee, the Biopharmaceutical Manufacturers Advisory Committee and the Food Manufacturing Energy Efficiency Committee to support companies in energy efficiency improvement.The manufacturing sector in particular is heterogeneous, with varied manufacturing processes and bespoke equipment and systems. In addition to setting energy efficiency standards for common industrial systems and equipment, NEA analyses the energy performance of systems and equipment of more than 180 energy-intensive companies regulated under the Energy Conservation Act and shares the findings with individual companies, as benchmarked against others in their respective manufacturing sub-sectors.Climate action requires collective action from all stakeholders. We have been working with our 3P (People, Private and Public) partners to co-create and co-deliver solutions for our environmental challenges. My Ministry will continue to work closely with all stakeholders to build a more sustainable and climate-resilient future."
arrangements to ensure workers subjected to stay-home notices are effectively segregated in dormitories,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how many of the 30,000 or so Chinese workers returning to work in Singapore are in dormitory accommodation; and (b) what arrangements are in place to ensure that workers who are subject to Stay-Home Notices are effectively segregated from other workers who are not subject to the Notice, be it in their assigned rooms or in the use of common facilities in the dormitories such as bathrooms, canteens, shops, or recreational or open areas.","Mrs Josephine Teo: A big majority of the Chinese work pass holders who travelled to China over the new year period have yet to return to Singapore. This is because of MOM's strict requirement for their employers to seek prior approval, to ensure an orderly flow and enable effective enforcement of the Stay-Home Notices (SHN) upon arrival. An average of 220 applications have been approved daily. Upon their return, all the workers are expected to serve the SHN. Those found to have wilfully flouted the SHN have had their work passes revoked and permanently banned from working in Singapore. Employers who were non-compliant have also had their work pass privileges suspended.Among those who have not returned, an estimated 25% stay in HDB units while 75% stay in other accommodation including dormitories and private residences.In line with the advice from the public health professionals, persons who are on SHN need not be segregated. Nevertheless, MOM informed dormitory operators to take additional precautionary measures to minimise contact between persons on SHN and their other residents. Residents on SHN would thus reside in a section of the dormitory that is separate from the other residents. Food and daily necessities are provided so that there is no need for them to leave their room, except to seek medical attention.Apart from specific measures for residents on SHN, MOM has also advised dormitory operators to cease mass activities, stagger the use of common facilities, and manage residents who have mild flu-like symptoms by isolating them and seeking medical attention immediately."
number of applications made under guardianship of infants acts in last five years,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Law in the last five years (a) how many applications have been made under the Guardianship of Infants Act; (b) how many applications have been made to assign guardianship to a person not biologically related to the child; and (c) under what circumstances are applications to assign guardianship to a person not biologically related generally approved.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The number of applications made under the Guardianship of Infants Act (Cap 122) (""GIA"") from 2015 to 2019 is as follows: These applications include those for guardianship and other types of applications relating to infants such as maintenance, custody, care, and control under the GIA.We do not track the cases where the guardian appointed under the GIA is not biologically related to the infant.Applications to appoint a guardian under the GIA must first fall within one of the applicable provisions of the GIA.Under section 6 of the GIA, the court may appoint a guardian where:(a) Either the infant's father or mother has passed on and no guardian had been appointed by that father or mother. The court may appoint a guardian to act jointly with the surviving parent.(b) The infant has no parent, no guardian, and no person having parental rights with respect to him.Under section 10, the court may remove and replace an infant's guardian. Testamentary guardians may be appointed by parents by deed or will under section 7.The appointment of the proposed guardian must also be in the best interest of the infant, as the welfare of the infant is the first and paramount consideration in such applications.There is no requirement for the proposed guardian to share a biological relationship with the infant."
consideration to formulate regulations binding on artificial intelligence systems deployed locally,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Communications and Information whether the Government is considering formulating regulations binding on artificial intelligence (AI) systems deployed locally so as to ensure the ethical and safe use of AI.,"Mr S Iswaran: As AI technology is still nascent, MCI does not have immediate plans to introduce new laws to regulate AI.    However, MCI has launched several initiatives to ensure the safe and ethical use of AI, and to promote consumer trust and innovation. These include:(a)  A Model AI Governance Framework (""Model Framework"") which translates ethical AI principles into practical steps to guide organisations' responsible adoption of AI;(b)  An Advisory Council on the Ethical Use of AI and Data, which provides guidance to manage legal, ethical and sustainability risks; and(c)  A Research Programme on the Governance of AI and Data Use, which examines ethical and legal issues arising from the development and use of AI.The Personal Data Protection Commission (""PDPC"") also works with sectoral regulators such as MAS on sector-specific guidance (i.e. MAS' Fairness, Ethics, Accountability and Transparency (""FEAT"") principles)1 that is in line with PDPC's Model Framework.Organisations are also required to comply with relevant laws and regulations when deploying AI technology such as those pertaining to safety, data protection and fair competition.MCI and PDPC will continue to monitor global developments, and ensure that our regulatory approach safeguards individuals' interests and preserves public confidence in AI, while enabling data-driven innovation to thrive in the Digital Economy."
consideration to incentivise fathers to take government-paid paternity leave,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Prime Minister whether the Government will consider incentivising fathers to take their Government-Paid Paternity Leave (GPPL) by providing additional leave to couples which can be used by either the mother or father where the father has consumed his full entitlement of GPPL.,"Mrs Josephine Teo (for the Prime Minister): Fathers play an important role in their children's care and development. As more fathers play an active role in raising their children, the take-up rate of paternity leave has risen from 25% when it was first introduced in 2013, to 53% for recent cohorts. As mentioned in a recent response to Mr Louis Ng's Parliamentary Question on barriers to fathers taking paternity leave, our research showed that fathers' utilisation of paternity leave is dependent on workplace support, especially from supervisors and colleagues. As such, giving fathers additional leave may not help to raise the take-up rate of paternity leave. Instead, it is especially important for us to work together to shape more supportive workplace norms and culture for parents. When considering further enhancements to leave schemes, we also have to balance support for parents with employers’ concerns over manpower needs at the workplace. This is especially so in times of business uncertainty. Beyond leave provisions, the Government encourages employers to adopt the Tripartite Standards on Flexible Work Arrangements (FWAs) and Unpaid Leave for Unexpected Care Needs. The Ministry of Manpower's Work-Life Grant also provides funding support for employers to implement FWAs. These practices are helpful to parents in caring for their children and make for a more family-friendly workplace. We will continue to work with tripartite partners to encourage companies to better support parents in managing their work and family responsibilities. "
conduct independent environmental assessments and release regular reports to public during construction of cross island mrt line,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry will conduct independent environmental assessments and release regular reports to the public on the implementation and effectiveness of mitigation measures during the construction of the Cross Island MRT Line within and around the Central Catchment Nature Reserve.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: LTA will require its appointed contractor, who will construct the Cross Island Line (CRL) in the vicinity of the Central Catchment Nature Reserve (CCNR), to engage an environmental consultant. The consultant's role is to strictly implement the mitigation measures identified in the Environmental Monitoring and Management Plan (EMMP). The EMMP is part of the gazetted Environmental Impact Assessment report for the CRL alignment in the vicinity of the CCNR. It was formulated in close consultation with stakeholders, such as nature groups. LTA will also invite key representatives of nature groups to be part of the implementation process, which includes jointly reviewing these mitigation measures. In addition, LTA will engage a group of experts to form an Environmental Advisory Panel (EAP). The EAP's role is to review and provide an independent assessment of the environmental consultant's implementation of the EMMP."
consideration for ministries to produce climate compliance certificate prior to budget approval,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Prime Minister whether the Ministry will consider requiring all Ministries to produce a climate compliance certificate explaining how their budgets and operations will comply with Singapore's climate commitments prior to budget approval.,"Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): Meeting Singapore's climate commitments requires a whole-of-nation effort. Under the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change (IMCCC), various government agencies are involved in implementing a series of sectoral mitigation measures to enable Singapore to meet our climate commitments. For example, the Building and Construction Authority's (BCA) initiatives under the Green Building Masterplan will accelerate the proliferation of green buildings. This will help Singapore become an even more sustainable and highly liveable city.The public sector itself is taking concrete steps to lead in the adoption of sustainable practices and initiatives. This is coordinated through the Public Sector Taking the Lead in Environmental Sustainability (PSTLES) initiative, which was introduced in 2006 and updated in 2017. PSTLES serves as a platform to leverage the collective capabilities across the Whole-of-Government (WOG) to improve resource efficiency in the public sector and effect our commitment towards environmental sustainability.Under PSTLES, the SolarNova Programme aggregates demand for solar deployment across public sector buildings and spaces, catalysing solar adoption in Singapore. For example, HDB's target to deploy 540 Megawatt peak (MWp) of solar on the rooftops of HDB blocks will make up a significant proportion of our national target to deploy at least 2 Gigawatt peak (GWp) of solar deployment by 2030.Under the PSTLES initiative, the Government has set targets to reduce our electricity and water consumption, achieve Green Mark standards for our buildings, procure green electronics and paper products, and hold events and functions in venues with at least a Green Mark certified rating.We intend to raise our ambition for the next phase of the PSTLES initiative. More details will be announced later this year.Key efforts in environmental sustainability undertaken by government agencies are reported in the biennial publication – Singapore Public Sector Outcomes Review (SPOR). The publication takes stock of how Singapore has fared in addressing climate change, water and energy usage, and waste management, amongst other government programmes. In the light of these efforts, there is no need to require the Ministries to produce a climate compliance certificate."
statistics on number of emergency calls related to sucides and mental health conditions received by scdf and police in last three years,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) in the last three years, how many (i) emergency calls and (ii) 999 calls were received by the SCDF and Police respectively that are related to suicides and mental health conditions; (b) how many of these calls were false alarms; (c) what is the average and total number of hours spent by these frontline officers supporting people with mental health difficulties; (d) how are frontline officers trained to conduct psychological or other appropriate interventions; (e) how many persons attempting suicide were (i) able to receive timely support from emergency services and (ii) not able to receive such support and died by suicide before emergency services could reach them; and (f) why it is not feasible to adopt a specialised mental health ambulance or emergency response team.","Mr K Shanmugam: From 2017 to 2019, Police received an average of 1,204 reports of attempted suicide each year.We do not have statistics on the number of false alarms, the number of persons who were found dead from suicide by the time emergency services arrived, nor the total number of hours spent by our officers to engage persons with mental health issues. When the Police receive a report of attempted suicide, the nearest available resource will be dispatched to respond quickly to the case. If medical intervention is needed, the SCDF will also send the nearest available ambulance to the scene. If you want specialised ""mental health ambulances"" then you will have to have these in sufficient numbers to respond immediately to cases at any part of the island. That would not be a sensible approach. The right approach is to quickly get to such persons, with the use of normal ambulances, and make sure they get care. They can receive specialised mental healthcare thereafter. All Police officers receive training on how to manage cases involving individuals who are mentally distressed or traumatised. They also undergo regular refreshers through after-action reviews of such incidents.Where necessary, the frontline officers will activate additional resources to assist with the case such as SCDF's Disaster Assistance and Rescue Teams (DART) and the Police’s Crisis Negotiation Unit (CNU). DART is specially trained for complex rescue operations, including cases of attempted suicide at height and in confined spaces. CNU has Police officers and psychologists who are trained in suicide intervention. This includes how to negotiate with the person attempting suicide to dissuade them from doing so."
number of students admitted to institute of mental health or other public hospitals in last three years,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Health in each of last three years, how many students were admitted to the Institute of Mental Health or other public hospitals for (i) mental health conditions and (ii) attempted suicides.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Over the past three years, the number of children aged 7 to 18 years old1 admitted into public hospitals2 for mental health conditions3 was approximately 569 in 2016, 640 in 2017 and 607 in 2018.4 Hospitals currently do not track whether an admission is due to attempted suicide. Based on records from the Ministry of Home Affairs, from 2017 to 2019, an average of 1,204 cases of attempted suicide was reported each year.5A whole of society approach would be key in supporting youths with mental healthcare needs as the Ministry of Health continues to work with health and social agencies to ensure that we provide timely and holistic care."

criteria used in assessing electricity retailer's application to pass on additional costs to consumers,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Trade and Industry what set of criteria does EMA use when assessing an electricity retailer's application to pass on additional costs, arising from the carbon tax, to consumers.","Mr Chan Chun Sing: Retailers offer two main types of plans to households. For standard price plans (SPPs), retailers are not allowed to change the electricity rates midway through their contracts. For non-SPPs, retailers can include contract clauses that allow them to change the electricity rates at specific points in time through the contract, for various cost changes and other reasons. The clauses must clearly specify the exact dates, reasons and formula/ quantum of the rate changes upfront at the point of contract signing. When rates are changed, the onus is on the retailers to ensure that they are reasonable and in compliance with the clauses.The Energy Market Authority (﻿EMA) will not hesitate to investigate and take actions against any retailer which has imposed unreasonable prices on consumers or engaged in unfair contracting practices."
incorporate water points and sunshades into proposed redesign for future ns square,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for National Development in relation to the proposed designs submitted for the future NS Square (a) whether water points and sunshades for large audiences have been incorporated into the proposed redesign; and (b) if not, whether the Ministry will ensure that these facilities are incorporated into the final redesign.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Features such as water points are standard stadium-related amenities, and will be incorporated in the final design. The brief for NS Square also calls for designers to ensure that the proposed design provides an enjoyable and comfortable spectator experience during events, and this could include sunshades or other innovative designs."
air quality tests done at end of incineration plant flues,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources given that Singapore incinerates over 90% of its plastic waste (a) how is air quality coming out of the flue monitored; (b) whether there is a testing for a broad range of toxins and, if so, which toxins are tested for; and (c) whether the results of the air quality tests done at the end of the incineration plant flues be published in order to give comfort and shed light on the safety and health impact of this process.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The National Environment Agency (NEA) requires all operators of Waste-to-Energy (WTE) plants to engage an accredited laboratory to conduct emissions tests and submit results of those tests to NEA at least once a year. This is to ensure that the emissions from WTE plants comply with emission standards specified under the Environmental Protection and Management (Air Impurities) Regulations. These standards cover key pollutants associated with the incineration of plastics waste, such as carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, as well as dioxins and furans. Under the Environmental Protection and Management Act (EPMA), operators who fail to meet the specified standards can be fined up to $20,000 on the first conviction and up to $50,000 on the second or subsequent conviction. To complement emissions testing, NEA inspects WTE plants twice a year to verify that pollution control equipment are properly maintained and operating effectively.Singapore's emission standards are published as part of the Environmental Protection and Management (Air Impurities) Regulations under the EPMA. They are comparable with those in other jurisdictions. Our regulations do not require operators of individual facilities, including WTE plants, to publish their emissions test results. Nonetheless, operators of WTE plants may do so voluntarily. For the NEA-operated plants, data on the most common pollutants of concern, namely particulate matter, sulphur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen, are published annually on NEA's website."
"salaries of work permit holders since 1990, 2000 and 2019","Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether salaries have risen or fallen for work permit holders since (i) 1990 (ii) 2000 and (iii) 2019, and by how much; and (b) how much have industries that rely mostly on work permit holders seen a rise or decline in their profits since (i) 1990 (ii) 2000 and (iii) 2019.","Mrs Josephine Teo: From 2005 to 2019, the median monthly salary of work permit holders (excluding foreign domestic workers) increased by 2.2% per annum in nominal terms. Data from 2004 and before are not directly comparable as they also include the equivalent of S Pass holders who are generally higher skilled than work permit holders.Wages tend to reflect demand and supply of specific labour markets and may not correlate with profitability of the industries. In any case, as reported by the Economic Development Board (EDB), net operating surplus for the Marine Shipyard sector declined by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.2% per annum (in nominal terms) between 2005 and 2018. The Building and Construction Authority (BCA) reported that net operating surplus for the Construction sector grew by a CAGR of 9.3% per annum (in nominal terms) between 2005 and 2017. Work permit holders are a significant share of the workforce in both sectors."
consideration for government-paid paternity leave to be taken in shorter duration,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Social and Family Development whether the Ministry will consider allowing Government-Paid Paternity Leave (GPPL) to be taken in shorter durations such as half-days or hours.,"Mr Desmond Lee: Fathers play an important role in their children’s care and development, and paternity leave supports fathers in caring for their newborns. As fathers may have different work arrangements, the two weeks of paternity leave can already be taken flexibly, in durations shorter than one day, if there is mutual agreement between employers and employees. Beyond leave provisions, the Government encourages and provides support for employers to implement the Tripartite Standards on Flexible Work Arrangements (FWAs) and Unpaid Leave for Unexpected Care Needs, to develop a more family-friendly work culture. Parents may tap on such arrangements to care for their children as well. We will continue to work with tripartite partners to encourage companies to better support parents in managing their work and family responsibilities."
breakdown and statistics on plastic waste generated by households compared to commercial and industrial sectors,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources given that the official recycling rate for plastic in 2019 was 4% (a) what is the breakdown between plastic waste generated by households, as compared to plastic waste generated by commercial and industrial sectors; and (b) what percentage of plastic, by volume, remains after incineration and is left on Semakau Island.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The recycling rate for plastic in 2018 was about 4%. The National Environment Agency is reviewing Singapore's waste management and recycling statistics for 2019, and will publish them when ready.In 2018, Singapore generated 949,300 tonnes of plastic waste in Singapore. 41% was generated by domestic and trade sectors including households, and the remaining 59% by the industrial and commercial sectors. Plastic waste in Singapore is either recycled or incinerated in Waste-to-Energy plants, and not directly landfilled. Incineration reduces the volume of general waste, which includes plastics, by about 90%. The incineration ash is then disposed of at Semakau Landfill."
number of applications received from work permit holders to marry singapore citizens or permanent residents past five years,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Manpower (a) for each year of the past five years, how many applications have been received from current or former work permit holders to marry Singapore citizens or permanent residents; (b) of these, how many applications have been rejected; (c) what are the top three reasons for rejecting such an application; and (d) what are the considerations in determining whether an application is to be approved.","Mrs Josephine Teo: From 2015 to 2019, the Ministry received about 1,200 marriage applications per year from current or former work permit holders to marry Singapore Citizens or Permanent Residents. We assess all marriage applications holistically taking into account the applicants' ability to look after themselves and their families. In recent years, about 8 in 10 applications were approved. The most common reasons for rejection were lack of gainful employment or income instability."
measures to reduce active dengue clusters and efforts to protect vulnerable groups,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) how has the Ministry been dealing with the increasing number of reported dengue cases since mid-December 2019; (b) what is the current number of active dengue clusters; (c) what are the current plans and measures to reduce the number of active dengue clusters; (d) whether efforts have been stepped up to ensure Singaporeans are prepared for the dengue outbreak; and (e) whether there is a need to step up efforts to protect vulnerable groups such as young children and seniors.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: As of 22 February 2020, there were 110 active dengue clusters. Since the start of the year, a total of 2,894 dengue cases have been reported, with 386 cases reported in the week ending 22 February. The number of Dengue virus serotype 3 (DENV-3) cases has risen over the last three months. The monthly proportion of DENV-3 cases in January was approximately 46%, higher than the proportion of Dengue virus serotype 2 cases at 40%. We are watching very closely whether there is a potential for a serotype switch. Such a switch is historically associated with dengue outbreaks. Singapore has not had a dengue outbreak driven by DENV-3 in over two decades, hence our population’s immunity to DENV-3 is low. The National Environment Agency (NEA) is monitoring this closely.NEA, together with Inter-Agency Dengue Task Force partners and Town Councils, has stepped up inspections to remove potential mosquito breeding habitats. Community volunteers and grassroots leaders have also been working hard to raise awareness on dengue prevention. Of the 346 clusters notified this year, nearly 70% have been closed, with the cooperation of our partners and the community.NEA has made available information on dengue clusters and areas with high Aedes aegypti mosquito population on the NEA website and myENV app. These are useful indicators to encourage early intervention, heighten community awareness to the risk of dengue transmission, and facilitate targeted action by stakeholders and residents. From January 2020, NEA started distributing flyers to alert residents living in areas with high Aedes aegypti mosquito population. Dengue cluster alert banners have also been put up in cluster areas to update the residents and members of the public of the latest dengue situation within the precinct.In view of the dengue outlook for 2020, NEA will bring forward the launch of the annual National Dengue Prevention Campaign to March, ahead of the traditional mid-year peak dengue season. Together with grassroots leaders and Dengue Prevention Volunteers, NEA will embark on intensive nationwide outreach efforts. NEA does outreach to elderly at neighbourhood elderly corners using customised, vernacular-language videos. NEA also works with preschools and schools to provide dengue prevention materials depicting the life cycle of the Aedes mosquito, which also serves as a teaching aid.But NEA alone cannot prevent dengue transmission in Singapore. 60% of mosquito breeding habitats detected continue to be found in residential premises. In addition to doing the Mozzie Wipeout, residents, especially those living in dengue clusters or areas with high mosquito population, are advised to regularly spray insecticide inside their homes, targeting dark areas where adult mosquitoes are likely to be resting. Young and old, there is an urgent need for everyone to step up their efforts to eradicate mosquito breeding habitats together with community partners and NGOs. Everyone must do their part to protect themselves and their loved ones."
statistics on average period of stay and age of singaporeans in aged homes,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what is the average period of stay of Singaporeans in aged homes over the last five years; (b) what is the average age of Singaporeans when they first moved into aged homes and whether there is an increasing trend; (c) what is the breakdown of male to female ratio of Singaporeans residing in aged homes; (d) whether it is necessary to increase Singapore's pipeline of aged homes; and (e) whether the existing and planned pipelines of aged homes are able to meet future demands.,"Mr Desmond Lee: Sheltered Homes (SHs) provide residential and care services to seniors aged 60 and above, who have little or no family support. There are 14 SHs licensed under the Homes for the Aged Act. We do not track residents' age at admission to SHs. Based on a recent survey conducted in 2019 on SHs which are funded by the Ministry of Social and Family Development, the average age at admission was 72 years; and the average length of stay was about six years. The gender ratio of residents in SHs is about one male to one female. There are no immediate plans to set up more SHs as the occupancy rate has been relatively stable.Not every senior requires the services and close supervision provided by SHs. Most seniors prefer to grow old where they live, and with or close to their loved ones. To enable seniors to age in the community, there are other housing options such as senior group homes which provide assisted living in public rental flats for seniors with mild care needs. The Ministry of National Development and Ministry of Health will also launch a pilot on assisted living typology, where seniors can purchase a flat bundled with a package of programmes and services. Seniors with care needs can also access other services in the community, which include centre-based and home-based care services. The Government will continue to ensure that there are various options for seniors to age-in-place."
number of work permit holders not issued with key employment terms from 2016 to 2019,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how many work permit holders have not been issued with Key Employment Terms in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively; and (b) whether the Ministry will start collecting such data if it does not currently do so.","Mrs Josephine Teo: Under the Employment Act, employers are required to issue Key Employment Terms (KETs) in writing to all employees within 14 days from the start of employment. Employers who fail to issue KETs or issue an incomplete set of KETs may be subject to an administrative penalty of a fine up to $400 for each breach. Uncooperative employers will also be directed to rectify the breaches and failure to abide by the direction will be a criminal offence. A 2019 survey by MOM found that 98% of employees worked in private establishments that issued written KETs. This is consistent with our enforcement findings. The Ministry also ensures that the employment rights of workers are protected even if they are not given KETs by their employers. For work permit holders, employers will be required to pay minimally the salary that was declared in the In-Principle Approval letter and provide the statutory benefits as prescribed under the Employment Act. In resolving disputes, the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management and the Employment Claims Tribunals will draw adverse inference against employers who do not comply with our employment laws, such as failing to issue complete KETs in writing. MOM will continue to strengthen our enforcement and education of legislative requirements for KETs through mass media, WorkRight initiatives and targeted outreach to employers and workers. "
requirement for employers to declare reasons for salary reduction from amount stated in in-principle approval letter,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Ministry will consider requiring employers to declare the reasons for the salary reduction from the amount stated in the In-Principle Approval letter of a foreign worker when they notify the Ministry and the foreign worker of the reduction.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: When there is a dispute involving salary reduction from the amount stated in the In-Principle Approval letter, the onus is on the employer to show that he obtained the work permit holder's (WPH) written agreement and notified the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) beforehand. If the employer fails to prove either of the two requirements, the original declared salary holds and the employer will be required to make good any salary shortfall, regardless of reason for the salary reduction. In addition, MOM will also impose a fine of up to $10,000 per worker on the employer.The requirement for employers to obtain their workers' written agreement ensures that the WPH can refuse to give his consent. WPHs whose contracts are terminated by their employer for refusing to provide consent should seek help from MOM. MOM allows such WPHs to find a new employer and we work with the Migrant Workers’ Centre to facilitate the process.The suggestion by the Member to make employers declare the reason for the salary reduction when notifying MOM is redundant. Even if the employer did so, he would still need to obtain the written agreement of the WPH. In addition, it could have potentially unintended consequences, such as causing the worker to believe that the mere fact of notifying MOM regularises the salary reduction, even if the worker did not give his consent."
rationale for requiring work permit holder to seek approval to marry singapore citizen or permanent resident,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Manpower what is the rationale for the requirement that a current or former work permit holder who wishes to marry a Singapore citizen or permanent resident must seek approval from the Ministry when S Pass and Employment Pass holders are not subject to the same requirement.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: Work pass holders are meant to be transient. Persons who wish to stay in Singapore for the long-term must meet stringent criteria. Work permit holders (WPHs) are much less likely to meet the criteria than Employment or S Pass holders. As marriage to a Singapore citizen (SC) or permanent resident (PR) does not confer an automatic right of stay, it is better to have conveyed a clear signal in certain cases by not permitting the marriage in the first place. That said, in the last five years, about 8 in 10 WPHs have been granted approval to marry an SC or PR."
conduct study on why fathers are not taking their paternity leave,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Prime Minister (a) whether the Government has conducted a study into why fathers are not taking their paternity leave; (b) if so, what are the results of the study; and (c) if not, whether it will consider doing so.","Mrs Josephine Teo (for the Prime Minister): The Government has studied the barriers to fathers using their paternity leave, which can be taken within a year of the child's birth, through focus group discussions and interviews with fathers from a range of backgrounds.Our research showed that most fathers are keen to use their paternity leave and play a bigger role in child-raising. Across different types of jobs and companies, the key factor affecting fathers' utilisation of paternity leave is workplace support. This includes whether supervisors are adequately assuring that using paternity leave will not affect fathers' career prospects and that colleagues are willing to cover fathers' duties in their absence. The influence of workplace norms on paternity leave take-up is similar to other East Asian societies, such as South Korea and Japan, where take-up rates of paternity leave are less than 10%.1Even though workplace norms take time to change, we have seen encouraging progress. Our paternity leave take-up rate has risen from 25% in 20132 to 53% in recent cohorts. In the public sector, the majority of fathers (84%) take paternity leave. Even in Nordic countries where paternity leave has been implemented much earlier, the take-up rates are around 70% to 80%.3 More employers in Singapore are also adopting the Tripartite Standards on Flexible Work Arrangements and Unpaid Leave for Unexpected Care Needs, to support their employees in managing their work and family responsibilities.A whole-of-society effort is needed for fathers to feel supported in taking time-off from work to spend time with their children. We will continue to work with employers and other community partners such as the Centre for Fathering to provide better support for parents and promote greater paternal involvement in child raising."
factors considered in shortlisting and selection of design proposal for future ns square,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for National Development with regard to the procurement process for the future NS Square (a) whether sustainability and energy use are factors considered in the shortlisting and selection of the design proposal; (b) if so, what are the specific measures of sustainability and energy use that the Ministry considered; and (c) if not, why are these two factors not considered in the process.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Like all new large public sector buildings, the future NS Square will be required to attain the Building and Construction Authority's (BCA) Green Mark Platinum rating. The assessment takes into consideration factors such as the building's energy and water efficiency, and its operations and maintenance practices, including the use of sustainable and environmentally friendly products.In addition, shortlisted teams have the flexibility to propose other green features that can further enhance the sustainability and energy efficiency of the development. Agencies are evaluating the shortlisted design proposals for NS Square and will take into consideration the measures proposed to enhance sustainability and energy efficiency."
"data on median and mean road taxes paid by owners of electric, hybrid and petrol cars in past three years","Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Transport (a) for each year in the past three years, what was the median and mean road tax paid for a car owner of (i) an electric car (ii) a hybrid car and (iii) a petrol car respectively; and (b) whether the Ministry will start collecting such data if it does not currently do so.",Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The data are tabulated below.
number of cars registered under vehicle emission schemes from january 2018,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) for each month from 1 January 2018, how many cars have been registered under the Vehicle Emission Schemes in the A1, A2, B, C1 and C2 bands respectively; and (b) whether the Ministry will start collecting such data if it does not currently do so.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The Vehicular Emissions Scheme (VES) has been implemented for all new cars, taxis and newly imported cars since January 2018. It assesses vehicles on five key pollutants – carbon dioxide (CO2), hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter (PM). The VES band for the vehicles is determined by the worst-performing pollutant of the five being assessed. The quarterly registration trends under the respective VES bands show promising results in encouraging the uptake of cleaner cars."
"data on number of registered electric cars, hybrid car and petrol car in past three years","Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Transport for each year in the past three years (a) what are the numbers of registered (i) electric cars (ii) hybrid cars and (ii) petrol cars; (b) for each of the three categories of registered cars, how many are (i) between 600 cc to 1,000 cc (ii) 1,000 cc to 1,600 cc and (iii) 1,600 cc to 3,000 cc; and (c) whether the Ministry will start collecting such data if it does not currently do so.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The numbers of registered electric, hybrid and petrol cars are tabulated below."
update on possibility of disallowing downward revisions from salary indicated in in-principle approval letter of foreign workers,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Manpower whether she can provide an update on the Ministry's consideration on the possibility of disallowing downward revisions from the salary indicated in the In-Principle Approval letter (IPA) of a foreign worker.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: The Ministry has reviewed the possibility of disallowing employers from making downward salary revision entirely, and consulted relevant stakeholders, including Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF), Association of Small & Medium Enterprises (ASME) and the Migrant Workers' Centre (MWC). Through our consultations, tripartite partners recognise that there is a need to retain the flexibility to renegotiate employment terms, including making salary revisions to reflect the demonstrated performance of the worker. Disallowing downward revisions of salary entirely will leave the employer with no other option except to terminate the employment of a non-performing worker. Furthermore, tripartite partners have an understanding that in certain situations such as an economic downturn, businesses will reach an agreement with their workers on wage flexibility instead of retrenching the workers. Such approaches that cut costs to save jobs would no longer be possible if the Member's suggestion is adopted. Given the feedback from tripartite partners, the Ministry has decided to retain the flexibility for employers to revise the salaries of their foreign workers. We will continue to focus on protecting the interests of foreign workers by strongly enforcing against employers who reduce their workers' salaries without their agreement. When there are disputes involving salary reduction, the onus is on the employers to declare and substantiate their reasons for the salary reduction. The Ministry of Manpower's (MOM) actions against errant employers include requiring them to make good any salary shortfall to the workers and imposing a fine of up to $10,000 per worker. In 2019, we imposed a total of $488,000 in administrative financial penalties on 68 employers. MOM also allows such workers to be transferred to a new employer."
incorporating lessons on personal hygiene in school in fight against viruses and to cultivate good hygiene habits from young age,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Education whether the Ministry will work with the relevant agencies on incorporating lessons on personal hygiene in school as part of the fight against viruses so as to cultivate good hygiene habits from a young age and teach students to protect their health and well-being.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: Schools have been inculcating good hygiene practices in our students, through Physical Education and Form Teacher Guidance Periods. The lessons would start from Primary 1, and include the 8-step hand washing technique and 5-step Mozzie Wipeout.In response to the COVID-19 situation, schools have further enhanced these lessons, to further emphasise on personal hygiene, social responsibility and national resilience through a lesson package conducted in conjunction with the Total Defence Day commemoration. In addition to personal hygiene, students were also taught to enhance group hygiene using the daily wipe-down routine, and cleaning up after themselves in the canteen.An online Science learning package on ""Understanding COVID-19"" was developed to support students in understanding the coronavirus and its transmission. As a result, students will better appreciate the rationale for personal and group hygiene practices, and the importance of being socially responsible."
update on investigations into alleged animal welfare-related offences by operator of pet boarding facility platinium dogs club,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for National Development whether he can provide an update on its investigations into alleged animal welfare-related offences by the operator of the pet boarding facility Platinium Dogs Club.,Mr Lawrence Wong: NParks has concluded its investigations into the alleged animal welfare-related offences by the operator of the Platinium Dogs Club. The matter is currently undergoing legal assessment. It would not be appropriate to share investigation findings at this stage.
targeted efforts at reducing number of new drug abusers among our youths,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether there can be more targeted efforts at reducing the number of new drug abusers among our youths; and (b) whether the Ministry can equip VWOs and NGOs that work with at-risk youths with the needed anti-drug knowledge and measures.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) has put in place many preventive drug education (PDE) programmes targeted at youths. CNB also reaches out to youths through persons in positions of influence like parents, counsellors, educators, youth advocates, community leaders and National Service commanders, so that they can also help to advise the youths.A key touchpoint is the school setting. In January 2019, CNB launched a new exhibition for schools, incorporating Augmented Reality (AR), to give students a more immersive experience on the harms of drugs. CNB has reached out to close to 3,000 students so far, and received good feedback.Another initiative launched in August 2019 in collaboration with MOE is the After-School Engagement (ASE) programme, targeted at vulnerable and at-risk students.1 The ASE programme is an additional platform for students to learn about the harms of drug abuse and its consequences, through activities such as sharing by former drug abusers.Social media is another key platform. CNB regularly publishes on its social media, content about drugs. For example, it has pushed out a series of bite-sized infographics to explain the harmful effects of cannabis and the cost to society of cannabis legalisation, to de-bunk the misinformation surrounding cannabis.CNB also equips staff of community agencies such as the Ministry of Social and Family Development's (MSF) Boys' and Girls' Homes, Youth Centres supported by MSF, self-help groups and Social Service Agencies (SSAs) such as Fei Yue Family Service Centre and Care Corner Singapore Ltd, with knowledge of the tell-tale signs and behavioural changes of abusers. This facilitates the agencies' work when managing youths under their charge, and enables them to surface potential abusers for early intervention.CNB has also been working with the National Council Against Drug Abuse (NCADA). NCADA will be launching a media campaign in March 2020, built around Singapore's first interactive film ""HIGH"" directed by local filmmaker Royston Tan. The purpose of this campaign is to engage youths in conversations around drug abuse and anti-drug advocacy.CNB and NCADA engage community partners and volunteers through the United Against Drugs Coalition (UADC) and Anti-Drug Abuse Advocacy (A3) Network to amplify and strengthen anti-drug narratives.2 So far, CNB has recruited 162 youth advocates under the A3 Network. Last but not least, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and MSF co-chair the National Committee on Prevention, Rehabilitation and Recidivism (NCPR), which was set up to coordinate efforts in research, rehabilitation, as well as to address offending and re-offending, among at-risk children and youths, offenders and their families."
plan to commemorate 30th anniversary of singapore-china relations,Ms Tin Pei Ling asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs what is planned to commemorate the 30th anniversary of Singapore-China relations this year.,"Dr Vivian Balakrishnan: Singapore established formal diplomatic relations with China on 3 October 1990. We have a close, vital and multifaceted relationship with China involving our leaders, our corporate sector and at the people-to-people level in many fields including education, science and culture. Consequently, we have many frequent high-level exchanges, institutionalised platforms and substantive cooperation all across China. The Government-to-Government projects at the 1994 China-Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park; the 2008 Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City; and the 2015 Chongqing Connectivity Initiative are icons of success that reflect Singapore's complementary roles at various phases of China's spectacular development. We share deep economic relations. China has been Singapore's largest trading partner and Singapore has been China's largest foreign investor since 2013. Singapore and China are commemorating the 30th anniversary of Singapore-China diplomatic relations this year in the face of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. China has borne the brunt of the impact of the epidemic. The Singapore Government, our business community, as well as our people have come together to offer support to a friend in need by donating funds, some critically needed test kits and medical supplies to support communities in China which have been severely affected by COVID-19. As of 25 February 2020, the Singapore Red Cross has raised more than S$6 million. This is a reflection of concern for our Chinese friends and our solidarity with China and the international community to fight the virus, understand the disease, and prevent its further spread. We are confident that through close cooperation, Singapore, China, and the international community will ultimately overcome this challenge. I have just returned from attending a Special ASEAN-China Foreign Ministers' Meeting on COVID-19 in Vientiane, Laos where I also had a bilateral meeting with Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi. He thanked me for Singapore's encouragement and support during this challenging period for China. We reaffirmed the strong, multifaceted and mutually beneficial partnership between Singapore and China and discussed new areas of cooperation, including in enhancing public health. As part of our commemoration of 30 years of diplomatic ties between Singapore and China, we have planned a number of high-level exchanges this year. President Halimah Yacob has accepted President Xi Jinping's invitation to make a State Visit to China, while Singapore will host the 16th Joint Council for Bilateral Cooperation (JCBC), our apex institutionalised platform, co-chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat and Chinese Vice Premier Han Zheng, to advance bilateral cooperation. The 30th anniversary also coincides with the anniversaries of some of our key projects in China. This includes the 5th anniversary of the Chongqing Connectivity Initiative – our third Government-to-Government project – as well as the 10th anniversary of the China-Singapore Guangzhou Knowledge City, a state-level bilateral cooperation project. We will expand cooperation in existing and new areas, such as the Belt and Road Initiative and smart city development. Both sides have also planned activities that will highlight our close cultural ties, such as an exhibition of the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM)'s Tang Shipwreck Collection at the Shanghai Museum, which will showcase the longstanding links between Singapore and China, as well as the region along the maritime silk routes. ACM will also present an exhibition in Singapore titled ""Yongle.Wanli – Emperors of the Ming"", with the spotlight on China's Ming Dynasty and featuring artifacts loaned from the Palace Museum in Beijing. Such exchanges will further promote mutual understanding and enhance people-to-people ties, and we look forward to many years of close cooperation between Singapore and China."
lessons learnt from recent covid-19 outbreak,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Prime Minister (a) what lessons can be learnt from the recent COVID-19 outbreak; (b) what can be improved upon to better equip and prepare Singaporeans, including education in total defence, against a pandemic outbreak; and (c) whether the Government will include production of masks and other medical protective gears as a strategic facility and support of the investment of such a facility in Singapore.","Mr Lawrence Wong (for the Prime Minister): Singapore has faced several infectious disease outbreaks since SARS in 2003, including H1N1, Zika, and most recently Monkeypox. Many lessons have been drawn from these past experiences to improve our readiness for the next outbreak. Over the years, we have strengthened our epidemiological surveillance and containment capabilities, and held regular emergency preparedness exercises to keep ourselves operationally ready. The setting up of the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) has enhanced our infrastructure and capabilities to manage a disease outbreak in Singapore.When COVID-19 emerged, we alerted all our healthcare institutions and put in place precautionary measures according to our response plans. Even before Singapore had its first confirmed case, we anticipated that we would need a Whole-of-Government effort to respond effectively to this threat and we set up the Multi-Ministry Taskforce on 22 January 2020 to coordinate our responses and measures. Since then, the Taskforce has put in place in place a whole range of measures from border controls to extra precautions within Singapore. We will continue to monitor the situation and take more measures when necessary. We recognise that an important part of our system of defence is the role that every individual plays, by exercising social responsibility, practising good personal hygiene, and supporting our fellow citizens, especially our healthcare workers on the frontline. We must not let our fears overwhelm us and cause us to behave irrationally, selfishly or irresponsibly. Instead, let us support and look out for one another, so that we can all get through this together and emerge stronger.  It is also important not to spread unverified information or false news which can cause panic and fear. The Government has and will continue to push timely information through various platforms including broadcast media, display panels in HDB estates, websites and social media, so that Singaporeans can easily refer to these authoritative sources for news, health advisories and the latest updates.  The Government has also taken proactive steps to secure essential supplies, including masks. In peacetime, we had built up a stockpile of surgical and N95 masks. As we draw down on this stockpile, we will also need to replenish it with new supplies. In recent weeks, some places like Taiwan, Thailand and India have banned or tightened regulations on the export of masks. We are therefore strengthening the resilience of our supply chain, including looking for new sources, and developing local manufacturing capabilities.We will continue to do everything we can, to keep Singaporeans safe, and to overcome this challenging situation together."
measures to protect children at home from sexual grooming and harassment on social media,Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what measures are being taken to protect children from sexual grooming and harassment through their exposure to social media in the home and from a very early age; and (b) what percentage of all reported sexual assault cases involving children in the last three years took place in homes under the Public Rental Scheme.,"Mr K Shanmugam: We have strengthened the law to enhance protection for children against sexual offences. The amendments to the Penal Code came into effect on 1 January 2020. In particular, the threshold for the offence of sexual grooming has been lowered, by reducing from two to one, the number of instances of prior contact between the offender and the child needed to make out the offence. Another amendment is the reduction of the age floor below which an offender cannot be charged for the offence of sexual grooming, from 21 to 18 years of age. In addition, new offences were introduced, for example, to criminalise sexual communication with a minor or showing a minor a sexual image. This allows authorities to intervene earlier, before the offender is able to commit additional and more serious sexual offences.The Government has taken steps on various fronts to raise public awareness of the risks associated with the use of the Internet and social media. Through MOE's Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) programme, students learn about the harmful and criminal exploitation of the internet and how to protect themselves. MCI, on its part, has been strengthening digital literacy in Singapore. In July 2019, the Digital Media and Information Literacy Framework was launched to deepen Singaporeans' appreciation of the benefits and risks of digital technologies and information. MCI's partner agencies and programme owners, such as NLB, have incorporated this framework into their programmes. Police do not track statistics on the number of sexual assault cases involving children, broken down by the type of housing in which the crime was committed. We take a serious view of sexual assault against all children, regardless of where it takes place. "
projected cost in grants and incentives and net job creation from $15.2 billion in fixed asset investments in 2019,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Trade and Industry regarding the $15.2 billion in fixed asset investments in 2019 (a) what is the dollar cost in grants and incentives to attract these investments; (b) how many of the 32,814 new jobs to be created are projected to be net job creation, rather than substitution of existing jobs in other firms or sectors; and (c) of the $15.2 billion, what amount is projected to be invested in the absence of grant and incentive support from EDB.","Mr Chan Chun Sing: The Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) uses a range of grant and tax incentives to attract investments into Singapore. These are compliant with the World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules, as well as with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) rules to address base erosion and profit shifting. The value of incentives awarded is a fraction of the projected total investment. Tax incentives are notional, and do not erode the tax base from existing activities. In addition, if a tax incentive recipient is not profitable, it will not enjoy any benefit. Other incentives such as training or research and development (R&D) grants are modest. Moreover, these grants are administered on a reimbursement basis. In other words, if the grant recipient does not incur the expenditure, it will not receive the grant.  The number of jobs created are new jobs linked to new and expansion projects committed in that particular year. It is not meaningful to hypothesise the investments into Singapore absent these incentives. Competition for these investments is intensifying, and we must continue to remain globally competitive and an investment destination of choice. Doing so requires us to go beyond incentives, to strengthen our fundamentals such as our strong rule of law, pro-business environment, physical and data connectivity, and access to skilled talent. MTI will continue to do so, to grow our economy and better Singaporeans' lives."
projection on absolute and percentage change in net carbon emissions each year from 2019 to 2023,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources for each year from 2019 to 2023 (a) what does the Ministry project will be the absolute and percentage change in net carbon emissions in each individual year; and (b) what percentage of absolute change in each individual year does the Ministry project will be attributable to the carbon tax rate of $5 per tonne of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: For our 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), we have pledged to reduce our emissions intensity (emissions per dollar GDP) by 36% from 2005 levels by 2030, and to stabilise emissions with the aim of peaking around 2030. Given expected growth in economic activity and increased energy demand, Singapore's greenhouse gas emissions are projected to rise over the next few years before stabilising. Short-term year-on-year emissions projections may be affected by a multitude of factors such as unforeseen disruptions, and are thus not a good reflection of the emissions trajectory.To achieve our 2030 NDC, the Government is putting in place mitigation measures to reduce emissions across all sectors, such as the industry, transport and building sectors, and ensure that Singapore continues to develop in a sustainable manner. The carbon tax is not standalone. It forms part of our comprehensive suite of mitigation measures. It provides an important economy-wide price signal to spur emissions reduction, while giving companies the flexibility to take action where it makes the most business sense. The Government is prepared to spend more than the expected carbon tax revenue of about $1 billion over the first five years to help companies improve their energy and carbon efficiency. As such, it is more meaningful to monitor the progress and impact of our mitigation package as a whole. "
"number of ""virtual"" restaurants operating by food apps in singapore","Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what is the current number of ""virtual"" restaurants that operate by food apps in Singapore; (b) whether there have been any hygiene lapses in these shared food preparation premises; and (c) what additional measures is the Ministry taking on ""virtual"" restaurants to safeguard public health and prevent food poisoning.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: ""Virtual"" food businesses, also known as ""cloud kitchens"", are food establishments that do not have a physical store front but sell food directly to consumers through online food delivery platforms. They are licensed by the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) under the Environmental Public Health Act. There were 61 of such food businesses as of 31 January 2020.Just like any other food establishment, ""virtual"" food businesses must comply with SFA's food safety requirements and standards, and ensure that the food they prepare is safe to eat. For instance, their food handlers and food hygiene officers must all be trained and certified under the Basic Food Hygiene Course and the Workforce Skills Qualifications' ""Conduct Food & Beverages Hygiene Audit"" programme respectively. These ""virtual"" food businesses are also subjected to inspection and enforcement actions by SFA just like other food establishments. Since ""virtual"" food businesses started being licensed in 2017, there has been one food hygiene and safety offence committed which involved an unregistered food handler. Should a ""virtual"" food business be suspended due to food hygiene and safety lapses, its food handlers and food hygiene officers must undergo re-training and re-certification as per any other food establishment. Food safety is a joint responsibility across the industry, consumers and the Government. All food establishments must play their part to upkeep high standards of food safety as well as environmental and personal hygiene at all times."
increase in number of non-renewal of road tax offences after implementation of e-notification to vehicle owners,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether there has been an increase in the number of offences related to non-renewal of road tax after the implementation of the e-notification to vehicle owners; and (b) whether LTA can consider withdrawing the notice of offence related to non-renewal of road tax especially if the offence was committed for the first time by the motorist.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: In November 2018, LTA introduced e-notifications for vehicle-related transactions such as road tax renewals to provide vehicle owners with timely and convenient updates. To ensure reasonable notice, vehicle owners are sent notice of renewals one month ahead of the expiry date. Subsequent electronic reminders are issued seven days and three days before road tax expiry. These reminders are issued via hardcopy letters to vehicle owners who prefer physical notifications. It is an offence for vehicle owners to fail to renew their road tax on time. Since the introduction of e-notifications, the number of such offences has decreased from 7.3% in 2018 to 6.9% in 2019.  We have no plans to withdraw the offence of non-renewal of road tax, which ensures compliance with the road tax regime. LTA will assess each appeal carefully, taking into account extenuating circumstances."
records on death of licensed dogs at dog farms and pet shops in past three years,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for National Development for each year in the past three years (a) how many dogs have died while licensed to (i) dog farms and (ii) pet shops respectively; (b) how many of these dogs died as a result of euthanasia in these premises respectively; and (c) whether the Ministry will start collecting such data if it is not already doing so.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: In 2019, dog farms and pet shops reported that 134 and 14 licensed dogs died at their establishments respectively. In 2018, the figures were 162 and 26 licensed dogs respectively. We do not have figures for 2017, as the requirement for these establishments to report deaths of licensed dogs in their care only came into effect then.  Currently, NParks does not require the establishments to provide information on the cause of death. NParks will look into this as part of its ongoing efforts to enhance traceability of animals, in order to protect public and animal health. "
breakdown of number of covid-19 cases by type of residence prior to diagnosis,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Health whether he can provide a breakdown of the number of COVID-19 cases by type of residence in Singapore prior to diagnosis, namely (i) registered hotels and serviced apartments (ii) group quarters such as dormitories and hostels (iii) residential housing where the case is an unregistered commercial occupier (eg. through Airbnb, unregistered sublet, or other commercial arrangement) (iv) residential housing where the case is an unregistered family or friend of a registered occupier (v) residential housing where the case is a registered occupier or owner and (vi) no residence, as the case was quarantined immediately on entry.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: As of 17 February 2020, there were 77 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Singapore. Of these, 10 were staying in hotels or serviced apartments. One was living on board a cargo vessel, one was living in Malaysia, and one was living in a dormitory. Six were evacuated from Wuhan and quarantined on entry. The remaining cases were living in residential housing prior to diagnosis.  "
statistics on workplace harassment in last three years and efforts to set up watchlist on employers,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Manpower for each year in the last three years (a) how many employers have been the subject of complaints regarding workplace harassment; (b) whether the Ministry has set up a watchlist or other measures to identify employers who have not dealt adequately with workplace harassment; (c) how many employers have been placed on such a watchlist, if it exists; and (d) how many employers on such a watchlist have received training or other help from TAFEP and successfully exited the watchlist.","Mrs Josephine Teo: With greater awareness following the global #MeToo movement in late 2017, and TAFEP's establishment of a help & resource centre for managing workplace harassment in 2019, we have seen more reports of workplace harassment where employers have been the subject of such complaints.In each of these cases, the employer had not properly followed up on allegations of workplace harassment. TAFEP engaged the employer to educate and ensure they implement measures in the Tripartite Advisory on Managing Workplace Harassment, including asking the employer to re-investigate the complaint, where necessary. Specifically in one of these 22 cases, as the employer was alleged to have verbally harassed the complainant, TAFEP additionally advised the employer to be more mindful of his behaviour and respectful when engaging his staff. So far, all the employers that TAFEP engaged have been cooperative and receptive to their advice.A watchlist allows MOM to monitor specific workforce metrics of employers suspected of errant behaviours to see if they have improved their employment practices. However, workplace harassment complaints typically involve specific incidents and persons. There are no clearly identifiable metrics to monitor. A watchlist approach is therefore impractical. Instead, MOM's policy is to revoke the work pass privileges of egregious offenders, such as employers who fail to provide a safe environment for employees or refuse to improve their grievance handling processes. So far, we have not encountered a case of such severity."
reduction of salary of work permit holders to below amount stated on in-principle approval letter,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Manpower for each year in the past three years, among notifications sent by employers to the Ministry to reduce the salary of a work permit holder to below the amount stated on the in-principle approval (IPA) letter (a) what has been the median absolute amount of reduction; and (b) what has been the median percentage of reduction compared to the initial salary.","Mrs Josephine Teo: In the past three years, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) was notified of salary reductions affecting less than two percent of non-domestic work permit holders (WPH) per year. The median amount of salary reduction reported was $170 in 2017, $160 in 2018 and $100 in 2019. The median percentage of reduction reported was 20% in 2017, 22% in 2018 and 17% in 2019, compared to the initial salary declared.Under our laws, employers are not allowed to reduce the salary of their work WPHs below what was declared on the In-Principle Approval (IPA) letter unless they have obtained the workers' written agreement and notified the Ministry beforehand. WPHs who have their salary reduced without their agreement should approach MOM or the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM) to lodge a case. MOM will require him to make good any salary shortfall to the worker and impose a fine of up to $10,000. WPHs whose employment contracts are terminated by their employers for not agreeing with the salary reductions should also come forward to seek help from MOM. MOM will allow such WPHs to transfer to a new employer."
statistics on primary and secondary school children homeschooled in past five years and assessment on their social-emotional and character development,"Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Education (a) what is the number of primary and secondary school children who are home-schooled currently and whether this has increased over the past five years; (b) whether the Ministry assesses or tracks the socio-emotional and character development of the home-schooled children; and (c) if so, how is the assessment done.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: The number of home-schooled children has remained small and generally constant, at an average of 50 Singaporean children for each primary age cohort every year. We do not track the number of Singaporean children who are home-schooled at the secondary level as they do not come under the ambit of the Compulsory Education Act. But it is likely to be fewer than primary school for each cohort as many home-schoolers do eventually enrol in mainstream primary schools, or secondary schools after PSLE.  Each application for home schooling is approved on a case by case basis. Parents have to submit an academic learning plan, as well as a plan on how they are going to develop their child's character, deliver education in citizenship and social emotional competencies. Annually, parents are required to submit a progress report updating MOE of the progress of their child's learning in the different areas. In addition, MOE Inspectors engage parents during home visits to ascertain the delivery of the learning outcomes in the different domains. "
update on number of mediation requests and their outcomes since establishment of tripartite alliance for dispute management,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Manpower since the establishment of the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management in April 2017 (a) what is the number of mediation requests that do not result in a mediation session; (b) what types of cases typically result in amicable resolution and which do not; and (c) what are the outcomes of cases that cannot be resolved through mediation, broken down by type of case and outcome.","Mrs Josephine Teo: Between April 2017 and December 2019, there were 26,000 mediation requests lodged with the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM), of which more than 70% went to mediation. Of the remaining cases, most claimants withdrew their claims before mediation took place. Of the claims that went through mediation, more than 80% were resolved amicably by TADM. These tend to be cases where the facts were clear or salary arrears had not been accumulated over a long period. Claims that could not be resolved through mediation would be referred to the Employment Claims Tribunals (ECT) for adjudication. About 40% of cases that were referred to the ECT resulted in money orders issued to employers to settle the claims. The remaining claims were dismissed by the ECT or withdrawn by the claimant.For more details, the Member may wish to refer to the Employment Standards Report published by MOM in October 2019."
number of in-principle approval letters issued for foreign domestic workers with zero rest days declared,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Manpower in the last five years, how many In-Principle Approval (IPA) letters has the Ministry issued for foreign domestic workers with zero rest days declared.","Mrs Josephine Teo: Employers are required to provide their Foreign Domestic Workers (FDWs) with a weekly rest day. If an FDW agrees to work on her rest day, her employer is required to provide compensation in lieu of the rest day.  Based on information collected by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) over the past four years, about 20% of FDWs agreed to be compensated in lieu for all their rest days at the point of work permit application. Nonetheless, FDWs and employers tend to subsequently make changes to the rest day arrangements during the employment period, based on mutual agreement. For example, some FDWs may wish to take more rest days per month after they have paid off their placement loan. Based on MOM's survey with FDWs in 2015, 98% of FDWs surveyed had at least one rest day a month. This is consistent with a survey of FDWs conducted by the Centre for Domestic Employees in 2017, where 96% had at least one rest day a month."
statistics on primary schools with highest alumni under integrated programme in last three years,Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Education for each of the 17 Integrated Programme (IP) schools in the last three years (a) which are the three primary schools with the highest alumni respectively; and (b) what percentages of their respective student populations are made up of students from the three primary schools.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: In general, IP schools are drawing from a larger number of primary schools. This is because parents are more willing to send their children to primary schools near their homes, instead of popular schools. To the Member's specific question, across our 17 schools that offer IP, there is considerable variation in terms of which are their three highest-contributing primary schools. On average, these primary schools account for 24% of IP schools' admission, falling from 27% in 2019 and 28% in 2018.  Our IP schools are taking active steps to ensure that they remain accessible to deserving students from all primary schools, including through the Direct School Admission scheme. IP schools also undertake individual efforts to increase diversity in admissions, from enhancing their school-based awards to reaching out to the community."
publishing absolute and percentage change in total carbon emissions for facilities that paid carbon tax to provide clarity on emission impact of carbon tax,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) for 2019, what has been the absolute and percentage change in total carbon emissions for facilities that paid the carbon tax compared to 2017 and 2018; (b) when does the Ministry plan to publish this data if it is not yet available; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider publishing this data on a yearly basis to provide clarity on the emission impact of the carbon tax.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The Carbon Pricing Act (CPA) came into force on 1 January 2019, giving effect to the carbon tax. The carbon tax provides an economy-wide price signal to encourage emissions reduction and the transition to a low-carbon economy. The carbon tax covers around 80% of our national emissions and applies to facilities in the manufacturing, power generation, waste and water management sectors which emit 25,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent or more annually. These companies have been monitoring their emissions for the year 2019, and must submit verified 2019 emissions reports to the National Environment Agency by 30 June 2020. The Government is unable to disclose company- or facility-specific data due to data confidentiality requirements as provided for in the CPA. The Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR) publishes data on Singapore's total greenhouse gases annually in the Key Environmental Statistics, which is available on the MEWR website. We also publish more detailed information on our greenhouse gas inventory in accordance with guidelines under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Our latest National Communications and Biennial Update Report was submitted to the UNFCCC in December 2018 and this report can be found on the website of the National Climate Change Secretariat. We will be submitting the next report by December 2020, and it will similarly be made available publicly. "
"changes in protocol for spf, scdf and imh following decriminalisation of attempted suicide in singapore","Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what are the changes in protocol for SPF, SCDF, IMH and other agencies respectively given the decriminalisation of suicide from 1 January 2020; (b) whether the Ministry will consider including suicide first-aiders as part of the SGSecure Responder effort in the SGSecure application, similar to how first-aiders are tapped on to respond to individuals with physical health emergencies; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider piloting an emergency response model that adopts a specialised mental health ambulance or emergency response team.","Mr K Shanmugam: As attempted suicide is no longer a crime, the Singapore Police Force (SPF) will no longer record it as an offence. However, the Government will continue to track data on attempted suicide that are made known to us.The Member suggested tapping on first-aiders to help in cases of attempted suicide. SGSecure Responder is an initiative to alert community responders to fire and cardiac arrest cases. It is much more challenging for community responders to intervene in attempted suicide cases due to their complexity. Members of the public should continue to call the Police or the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF).The Member also suggested specialised emergency response for suicide cases. That may not be feasible. We have SPF and SCDF officers who are trained to intervene in suicide attempts, and they will be mobilised when such cases are reported. The SPF's Crisis Negotiation Unit will also help where necessary. The SCDF's Disaster Assistance and Rescue Teams (DART) are specially trained for complex rescue operations, including cases of attempted suicide at height and in confined spaces. There are also helplines, such as the Institute of Mental Health's (IMH) 24-hour Mental Health Helpline, that distressed persons can call."
breakdown of number of families consisting of singaporean citizens married to non-resident spouses with citizen and non-resident children,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Prime Minister in each of the last five years, what is the number of families consisting of a Singaporean citizen married to a non-resident spouse, with (i) at least one citizen child and at least one non-resident child and (ii) at least one non-resident child respectively.","Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): The latest available estimate is from the General Household Survey, which was conducted in 2015. Based on the survey, there were an estimated 18,700 couples1 comprising a Singapore Citizen (SC) married to a Non-Resident (NR) in 2015. Of these, around 1,200 couples had at least one NR child. By comparison, around 7,000 couples had at least one SC child2. We currently do not have an estimate on the number of couples who have at least one SC child and at least one NR child living with them. From the Census of Population 2020 to be conducted this year, we will assess if we can obtain this data."
plans to study effectiveness of pilot household services scheme,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether the Ministry will be studying the effectiveness of the pilot Household Services Scheme that allows foreign workers to provide domestic services to households; (b) if so, what factors will be used to determine the effectiveness of the Scheme; and (c) how long does the Ministry intend to run the pilot before deciding to formalise the Scheme.","Mrs Josephine Teo: The Household Services Scheme (HSS) was piloted in 2017 to allow eligible companies to hire more foreign workers to provide part-time domestic services, such as home cleaning. Since then, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has been monitoring the demand for part-time domestic services and studying the effectiveness of the HSS in meeting households' needs for part-time domestic services. As demand for part-time domestic services picked up, MOM expanded the number of HSS companies from 15 in 2017 to 50 in 2019. We are still monitoring the Scheme to assess how it is meeting the needs of households and providers of domestic services, and the risks of HSS workers being diverted by companies to non-domestic work. The pilot has been extended to run until August 2020, and MOM will evaluate the results of the pilot thereafter."
government expenditure on singapore bicentennial activities and outcomes achieved,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Prime Minister (a) what is the total Government expenditure on the Singapore Bicentennial, broken down by major activities or heads of expenditure such as the Bicentennial Experience; (b) what are the estimates of attendance and participation for each major activity; and (c) what have been the social, cultural and economic outcomes.","Mr Desmond Lee (for the Prime Minister): The Singapore Bicentennial commemoration was a success. There were more than 250 events held in 2019, mostly organised by the community. The total visitorship was more than 9 million, with many attending more than one event. We also worked with 340 community partners and more than 3,500 volunteers, reflecting the broad support for the commemoration.Expenditure on The Bicentennial Experience at Fort Canning was about $35.5 million, of which $23 million was for the original run, and $11 million for the three-month extension due to overwhelming public demand. Just under $1.5 million was for conferences and books that explored Singapore's longer history. The commemoration also leveraged several existing annual events (e.g. iLight Singapore Bicentennial Edition, Singapore Night Festival) which were enhanced to feature the bicentennial themes.We received positive feedback from those who attended the various Singapore Bicentennial events. Many visitors appreciated the importance of reflecting on our past, in order to glean lessons for our future. Response to The Bicentennial Experience was particularly good. It was the first time that a large-scale exposition on Singapore's history had attracted such strong interest from over 760,000 visitors. In particular, younger Singaporeans including almost 20,000 NSFs and 105,000 students and pre-schoolers, came on learning journeys with their school teachers. More than 96% rated The Bicentennial Experience 'Good' and 'Very Good', reflecting the breakthrough in storytelling that benefits the visitors and offers lessons for other institutions to reference. About 93% said that it had increased their knowledge of Singapore’s history, and offered lessons for our future.The positive outcomes from this, and other community events, cannot all be quantified. For example, our community partners also felt that the Singapore Bicentennial commemoration provided a meaningful platform to showcase their community's history and origins, as well as to examine different aspects of Singapore's past. Many of their events engaged new audiences. Much of the new content created has also made different aspects of our longer history more accessible to the public, and will enrich our archives for future generations of Singaporeans.We would like to thank our community partners and volunteers for their support throughout the bicentennial year."
review requirement for singaporean staff of companies tendering for government contract to be members of trade unions,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Ministry will review and require all companies who are tendering for contracts called by the Government, statutory boards or town councils that their Singaporean workers must be members of the relevant trade unions.","Mrs Josephine Teo: The Ministry of Manpower supports workers seeking membership in a union registered with the Registry of Trade Unions. They can benefit from union support and representation, in areas such as training and upskilling, collective bargaining and dispute resolution.  However, it would be inappropriate to insist as a condition of Government contracts, that the contractors' workers be union members. Such a condition could lead to perverse outcomes. For example, a contractor may feel compelled to terminate a worker on account of his preference not to be a union member, in order to be eligible to bid for government contracts. To avoid unemployment, a worker may then feel compelled to join the union. This goes against the fundamental right of a worker to decide on union membership.The Government recognises unionised companies in other ways. For instance, companies can tap on an extra 10 per cent in funding support through the Enterprise Development Grant, if they work with unions to train workers as the companies' jobs transform. We also support unionised companies' efforts to be more progressive employers, through engagement programmes organised by the tripartite partners."
number of cases of employment-related disputes not covered under employment act and outcomes of these cases,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Manpower (a) when did the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM) start to hear employment-related disputes not covered under the Employment Act; (b) what led TADM to start hearing these disputes; (c) what is the total number of such cases received to date; and (d) what are the outcomes of these cases.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: Since Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM) was established in April 2017, it has been able to mediate employment-related disputes not covered under the Employment Act (EA). For disputes covered under other employment laws1 such as the payment of allowances, bonuses and commissions provided for in the employment contract, mediation is compulsory. For other disputes such as workplace grievances and poor employment practices, mediation is voluntary.In total, TADM has conducted mediation for about 12,000 employment-related disputes not covered under the EA, with about 70% resolved amicably. "
statistics on claims under medishield life and medisave withdrawals for psychiatric treatment in last three years,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Health in the last three years (a) what is the breakdown of claims under MediShield Life for psychiatric treatment in terms of (i) claims lodged and (ii) amount disbursed; (b) how many patients maxed out the claim cap, broken down by (i) cap per day ($100) and (ii) cap per year (35 days); and (c) how many patients are unable to tap on MediShield Life due to the exclusion criteria of ""treatment of injuries resulting from attempted suicide"".","17 Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Health in the last three years (a) what is the breakdown of MediSave withdrawals for inpatient psychiatric treatment and outpatient care respectively, in terms of (i) applications made and (ii) amounts withdrawn; (b) how many patients have reached the withdrawal limits, broken down by (i) cap of $150 per day (ii) cap of $5,000 per year for inpatient care and (iii) cap of $500 per year for outpatient care under the MediSave500 scheme; and (c) how are the mental health conditions included in the Chronic Disease Management Programme determined.Mr Gan Kim Yong: Singaporeans who require psychiatric treatments can receive subsidies of up to 80% of their bills at public healthcare institutions. MediShield Life provides additional coverage should they require an inpatient stay, and MediSave withdrawals can be made to offset the remaining cost of their bills. From 2016 to 2018, an average of 4,400 MediShield Life claims were approved and about $4 million paid out each year for inpatient psychiatric treatments. As MediShield Life is meant to cover medically necessary treatments for subsidised patients, the claim limit does not take into account patients with longer period of stays that may generally be due to social reasons. Among subsidised patients, around two in 10 exceeded the 35-day cap, and another four in 10 were within the 35-day cap but exceeded the $100 per day limit. About 300 claims each year are excluded from coverage as they are for treatment of injuries resulting from attempted suicide.Over the same period, an average of 4,800 patients withdrew about $6 million from MediSave for inpatient psychiatric stays each year. Based on the latest available data, less than one in 10 subsidised patients exceeded the yearly withdrawal limit of $5,000, while less than three in 10 subsidised bills exceeded the daily withdrawal limit of $150 per day. For outpatient care, an average of 14,000 patients a year utilised Medisave for psychiatric conditions under the Chronic Disease Management Programme (CDMP) from 2016 to 2018. These conditions are selected in consultation with a Clinical Advisory Committee comprising clinical experts. The factors considered include level of disease burden, effectiveness of early intervention, and availability of clear clinical guidelines. The MediSave limit for CDMP was raised to $500 in 2018, and about two in 10 patients who withdrew MediSave for psychiatric conditions reached the yearly withdrawal limit.MediShield Life and MediSave limits are reviewed regularly to ensure that they cover the majority of subsidised patients’ bills. The on-going review of MediShield Life, including the claim limits, by the MediShield Life Council is expected to complete by end 2020. Those who cannot afford their treatment even after subsidies, MediShield Life and MediSave can approach the medical social workers for MediFund and other financial assistance. "
smoking rate amongst young singaporeans in last 10 years and measures planned to further curb smoking,"Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Health (a) over the last 10 years, what is the smoking rate amongst young Singaporeans; (b) what are the factors causing Singaporeans to pick up smoking; (c) what is the average age in picking up smoking; and (d) what are the measures planned to further curb smoking amongst young Singaporeans.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Smoking prevalence among students in secondary schools, ITE and polytechnics decreased from 8% in the period from 2011-2013 to 4% in the period from 2014-20161. Similarly, smoking prevalence among Singapore residents aged 18-29 years has declined from 17.2% in 20072 to 9.9% in 2017.3 The average age of smokers who started smoking daily was 18 years in 2017.4 According to research conducted by the Health Promotion Board (HPB), the key reasons behind why the youth start smoking are social influence from friends and the perception that smoking is ""cool"".The Ministry of Health adopts a multi-pronged approach to curb smoking amongst Singaporeans young and old, which includes a comprehensive mix of strategies such as public education, provision of smoking cessation services, legislation controlling tobacco advertising, sales of cigarettes to minors and taxation.One key measure that addresses the role of social influence in smoking initiation is the Minimum Legal Age (MLA) for tobacco use. This was raised to 20 years on 1 January 2020, and will be raised to 21 years on 1 January 2021. This aims to denormalise tobacco use among youth below the age of 21, restrict their access to tobacco in their social circles, and hence reduce the likelihood of smoking initiation. To reduce the influence of positive communication around tobacco product brands, which may contribute to its perceived ""cool"" factor, the standardised packaging of tobacco products with enhanced graphic health warnings will come into force from 1 July 2020.  In the community and schools, HPB works with educators and community organisations to promote smoke-free living among our youth. HPB conducts smoking cessation training for educators and youth workers. In addition, Student Health Advisors are deployed in schools to support students on health issues, including tailored counselling to quit smoking. HPB also complements anti-tobacco messages in the school curricula with interactive programmes, such as assembly skits and workshops. "
update on work of advisory council set up in 2019 to promote ethical collection and use of data obtained from persons without their knowledge or consent for commercial use,Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Communications and Information whether he can provide an update on the work of the advisory council set up in 2018 to promote the ethical collection and use of data obtained from persons without their specific knowledge or consent for commercial use.,"Mr S Iswaran: The Advisory Council on the Ethical Use of AI and Data was formed in 2018 to provide guidance to the Government on the responsible development and deployment of AI.  It has made a good start in helping organisations improve their AI governance practices. It obtained industry views and advised the Government in developing and updating Singapore's Model AI Governance Framework (Model Framework), which translates ethical principles including human-centricity and safety into pragmatic measures that organisations can adopt voluntarily. This is important to engender public trust and acceptance of AI. A wide range of organisations is now using the Model Framework for their AI deployments.The Advisory Council also provided valuable input to the Implementation and Self-Assessment Guide for Organisations and Compendium of Use Cases, which help organisations apply the Model Framework. These two documents were released together with the second edition of the Model Framework in January 2020 at the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos. Collectively, they have helped to shape norms and advance Singapore's thought leadership in AI governance. The Advisory Council actively engages the community and industry on AI and data developments, including encouraging their adoption of the Model Framework. It also provides guidance to the Research Programme on Governance of AI and Data Use, hosted by the Singapore Management University, in advancing research and thought leadership in AI and data governance.  The Government will continue to work closely with the Advisory Council to help organisations use AI and data responsibly, including supporting more organisations to adopt the Model Framework. "
prohibiting dissemination of photos and videos of victims of accidents and crimes through electronic means,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Law whether the Ministry can consider prohibiting the dissemination of photos and videos of victims of accidents and crimes through electronic means.,"Mr K Shanmugam: There are existing laws that prohibit the dissemination of photos and videos of accidents and crimes through electronic means in certain instances.  First, in egregious cases where such conduct is accompanied by an underlying ill-intent or poses a law and order issue, offences under the Penal Code may be disclosed. If the dissemination is carried out with the intent to harass, Protection from Harassment Act (POHA) offences may be disclosed. Whether or not a criminal offence is disclosed depends on the facts and circumstances of each case. Second, under POHA, victims of harassing photographs or videos can also bring civil proceedings to require the publisher or social media platforms to take down the harassing material.We would like to remind everyone to behave compassionately and be mindful of the consequences when sharing photos and videos of victims of accidents and crimes. These photos and videos may cause distress to and inflict further trauma on the victims and their families. Beyond legal prohibition, society's norms and etiquette have to mature in tandem with the proliferation of online communication. That is why the Government and the Media Literacy Council have been promoting responsible online behaviour to create a safer and kinder internet. For example, the 2019 Better Internet Campaign, themed ""1 Click Away"", encouraged online users to think and exercise sound judgement about the effects of a simple act of clicking to share their posts or photos online. We will continue to build on such efforts."
number of retail establishments charged with selling cigarettes to customers below legal age in past three years,"Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked the Minister for Health for the past three years, what has the been the number of retail establishments that have been charged with selling cigarettes to customers below the legal age and what are the grounds for successful appeals against such offences.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Minimum Legal Age for the purchase, use, possession, sale and supply of tobacco products (MLA) was raised from 18 to 19 on 1 January 2019, and 19 to 20 years old on 1 January 2020. The MLA will subsequently be raised to 21 years old on 1 January 2021.Under the Tobacco (Control of Advertisements and Sale) Act, anyone caught selling tobacco products to persons below the minimum legal age is liable, on conviction in Court, to a maximum fine of up to $5,000 for the first offence and up to $10,000 for the second or subsequent offence. In addition, the tobacco retail licence will be suspended for six months for the first offence and revoked for the second offence. However, if any outlet is found selling tobacco products to under-aged persons in school uniform or those below 12 years of age, the tobacco retail licence will be revoked, even at the first offence.From 2017 to 2019, 74 retailers were caught for selling cigarettes to under-aged persons. HSA takes a strong view against such errant retailers and will not hesitate to take prosecution actions against them. For appeals to be considered, the retailer would need to demonstrate that he had reasonable grounds to believe that the person to whom he sold the tobacco product was not an under-aged person, and that he had done his due diligence to ascertain that the buyer was not an under-aged person.We want to remind tobacco retail licensees that they are responsible for all transactions of tobacco products taking place at their outlets, as well as the actions of their employees."
annual number of mediations conducted under auspices of singapore mediation centre and rate of successful settlements,"Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for Law (a) what is the annual number of mediations conducted under the auspices of the Singapore Mediation Centre from 2017 to 2019; (b) of these, what is the recorded rate of successful settlements; and (c) whether the Ministry has plans to encourage more commercial legal disputes to be resolved through mediation.","Mr K Shanmugam: 465, 466 and 490 mediations were conducted under the aupices of the Singapore Mediation Centre (SMC) in 2017, 2018, and 2019, with a recorded settlement rate of 65%, 69% and 66% respectively. The Ministry has over the years strengthened the framework for commercial mediation. In 2014, we established (i) the Singapore International Mediation Centre as the flagship organisation to provide international commercial mediation services; and (ii) the Singapore International Mediation Institute to establish accreditation schemes and raise professional standards for mediation. In 2017, we introduced the Mediation Act to strengthen the framework for enforcement of mediated settlement agreements. In August 2019, Singapore was among the first to sign the Singapore Convention on Mediation. We plan to be among the first countries to ratify the convention. To this end, the Ministry of Law has introduced the Singapore Convention on Mediation Bill in January, and the second reading of the Bill will take place at this sitting of Parliament. When the convention comes into force, it will provide for the cross-border enforcement of mediated settlement agreements, give businesses greater certainty and assurance, and encourage the greater use of mediation to resolve international commercial disputes. The Ministry of Law will continue to work with countries, businesses and practitioners to promote the benefits of mediation and the convention. We will provide technical assistance where needed to assist countries to work towards signing and ratifying the Convention. We will also continue to work with mediation institutions to strengthen the quality of our mediation services and build a strong pool of qualified mediators and practitioners."
number of traffic accidents in past five years involving bicycles and electric bicycles and efforts to educate cyclists on safe riding,"Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) in the past five years, what is the number of traffic accidents involving bicycles and electric bicycles respectively; (b) what enforcement efforts have been carried out so far and what actions have been taken against errant cyclists; and (c) how can Traffic Police better educate cyclists on safe riding.","Mr K Shanmugam: From 2015 to 2019, there were an average of 520 and 39 road accidents annually involving cyclists riding bicycles and power-assisted bicycles (PABs) respectively.To deter against disorderly or unsafe cycling behaviours, Traffic Police (TP) conducts enforcement at hotspots as well as locations reported by members of the public where unsafe road behaviour by cyclists is observed. Over the past five years, TP issued an average of 1,377 summonses per year to cyclists for various offences such as riding in a disorderly manner and riding in the hours of darkness without a front light.TP raises awareness of safe riding practices for cyclists through regular road safety talks at schools, companies and various community events. TP will continue to work with the Land Transport Authority, and other community partners, such as the Singapore Road Safety Council, to educate the public on the importance of safe riding. "
breakdown of government expenditure on long-term care services in fy2017 and fy2018,"Ms Yip Pin Xiu asked the Minister for Health in FY2017 and FY2018 (a) what is the Government expenditure on formal long-term care services, broken down by (i) nursing homes including inpatient hospices (ii) day care centres and (iii) formal homecare services; (b) how many people used (i) nursing home services (ii) day centre services and (iii) formal homecare services during these years; and (c) of these, how many were aged 60 and above.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Based on latest available data in FY2017, the Government's operating expenditure for long-term care services was about $580 million. About 60% of the expenditure was for residential long-term care. The remainder was for home and centre-based care, as well as other support schemes, such as active ageing programmes and the Seniors' Mobility and Enabling Fund. This is on top of the Government's development expenditure on new long term care capacity.In the same period, approximately 14,100 Singaporeans used nursing home services; 1,300 used inpatient hospice services; and 29,700 used home and centre-based care services.1 About 90% of them were aged 60 and above. "
number of cyclists booked for riding on roads without helmets since new regulation took effect,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Home Affairs how many cyclists have been booked for riding on roads without helmets since new regulations requiring cyclists to use helmets when riding on roads took effect from 1 February 2019.,"Mr K Shanmugam: Since 1 February 2019, pedal cyclists are required to use helmets when riding on roads. Cyclists using power-assisted bicycles (PABs) have been required to do so since 1 January 2005. Between 1 February 2019 and 31 December 2019, Traffic Police (TP) enforced against 109 cases of pedal cyclists and 25 cases of PAB cyclists who failed to wear helmets when riding on the roads. "
total value of customer prepayments for services or products lost due to business failure or inability to discharge contractual obligations,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) for each of the last three years, what is the total value of consumer prepayments for services or products that have been lost due to business failure or inability to discharge contractual obligations, broken down by (i) the motor car industry (ii) the beauty industry (iii) contractors and (iv) any other industries with significant consumer prepayment losses; and (b) whether mandatory escrow can be implemented for higher-risk consumer prepayments to protect consumers against such losses.","Mr Chan Chun Sing: Based on reports filed by consumers with the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) from 2017 to 2019, the value of reported prepayment loss can be attributed mainly to motor cars, renovation services, and beauty services. The breakdown of the reported loss in these three areas can be found in Table 1.Escrow arrangements have been implemented for some services like conveyancing services and major payment services. However, such arrangements may not be suitable for all businesses. Some use prepayments to facilitate the cashflow of their business operations to allow them to offer more competitive pricing to their customers. To help consumers identify businesses with good trading practices and shop with peace of mind, CASE has worked with industry associations to develop CaseTrust accreditation schemes for specific industries. In particular, the CaseTrust schemes for motor cars, renovation services, and beauty services require accredited businesses to safeguard consumers' prepayment through the purchase of insurance or insurance bonds.The Government will continue to monitor developments and consider additional sector-specific prepayment protection requirements as necessary, taking into consideration the cost impact on businesses and consumers."
review of nus business school researchers' findings on property developers exchanging information on government land sales resulting in imputed losses,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry and SLA will look into findings by NUS Business School researchers that property developers could be exchanging information about Government land sales which had led to imputed losses amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars due to lower winning tender bids.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The Government adopts an open, transparent and competitive tender process in the sale of sites under the Government Land Sales (GLS) programme. The tender process is transparent to all potential tenderers, with land sale requirements specified clearly in tender documents. With regard to the NUS study, the researchers themselves have withdrawn any claims of insider trading amongst developers, and said that they could not find any evidence that such activity had indeed taken place. In any case, MND has looked at the 103 GLS tenders awarded during the period referenced by the NUS study. For all of these tenders, multiple bids were received, ranging from three to as high as 23 bids for each site. More than 80 per cent of the tenders had five bids or more. All tenders were awarded to the tenderers with the highest acceptable bids, and these were broadly in line with or higher than independent estimates of the market value of the sites.  In the event there is reason to suspect any collusion or freak result, the Government will take the necessary actions, including closing the tender without award, or take enforcement action should there be any infringement of the law. "
fraudulent divorce cases in past five years by existing lessees of hdb flats to circumvent minimum occupation period or avoid buyers' stamp duties,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development for the past five years, whether there have been cases of fraudulent divorces committed by existing lessees of HDB flats to circumvent the Minimum Occupation Period or to avoid buyers' stamp duties.","Mr Lawrence Wong: The Courts have to be satisfied that there are valid and proven statutory grounds before granting a divorce. We are not aware of any divorces undertaken by HDB flat owners purely to circumvent the Minimum Occupation Period (MOP) or to avoid buyers' stamp duties.Following a divorce, the treatment of the matrimonial HDB flat, as stated in the Court Order, is still subject to HDB's rules. Regardless of whether the flat is to be retained by one party or sold on the open market, the parties must satisfy the prevailing eligibility conditions. For example, if the parties wish to sell the flat on the open market, they must have fulfilled the MOP by the divorce date. If the MOP has not been fulfilled and neither party is eligible to retain the flat, the parties would need to surrender the flat to HDB. Depending on the circumstances of the case, HDB may consider granting a special exemption for the divorced couple to sell their flat within their MOP. "
number of traffic accidents in past five years involving bicycles and electric bicycles and efforts to educate cyclists on safe riding,"Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) in the past five years, what is the number of traffic accidents involving bicycles and electric bicycles respectively; (b) what enforcement efforts have been carried out so far and what actions have been taken against errant cyclists; and (c) how can Traffic Police better educate cyclists on safe riding.","Mr K Shanmugam: From 2015 to 2019, there were an average of 520 and 39 road accidents annually involving cyclists riding bicycles and power-assisted bicycles (PABs) respectively.To deter against disorderly or unsafe cycling behaviours, Traffic Police (TP) conducts enforcement at hotspots as well as locations reported by members of the public where unsafe road behaviour by cyclists is observed. Over the past five years, TP issued an average of 1,377 summonses per year to cyclists for various offences such as riding in a disorderly manner and riding in the hours of darkness without a front light.TP raises awareness of safe riding practices for cyclists through regular road safety talks at schools, companies and various community events. TP will continue to work with the Land Transport Authority, and other community partners, such as the Singapore Road Safety Council, to educate the public on the importance of safe riding. "
breakdown of government expenditure on long-term care services in fy2017 and fy2018,"Ms Yip Pin Xiu asked the Minister for Health in FY2017 and FY2018 (a) what is the Government expenditure on formal long-term care services, broken down by (i) nursing homes including inpatient hospices (ii) day care centres and (iii) formal homecare services; (b) how many people used (i) nursing home services (ii) day centre services and (iii) formal homecare services during these years; and (c) of these, how many were aged 60 and above.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Based on latest available data in FY2017, the Government's operating expenditure for long-term care services was about $580 million. About 60% of the expenditure was for residential long-term care. The remainder was for home and centre-based care, as well as other support schemes, such as active ageing programmes and the Seniors' Mobility and Enabling Fund. This is on top of the Government's development expenditure on new long term care capacity.In the same period, approximately 14,100 Singaporeans used nursing home services; 1,300 used inpatient hospice services; and 29,700 used home and centre-based care services.1 About 90% of them were aged 60 and above. "
number of cyclists booked for riding on roads without helmets since new regulation took effect,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Home Affairs how many cyclists have been booked for riding on roads without helmets since new regulations requiring cyclists to use helmets when riding on roads took effect from 1 February 2019.,"Mr K Shanmugam: Since 1 February 2019, pedal cyclists are required to use helmets when riding on roads. Cyclists using power-assisted bicycles (PABs) have been required to do so since 1 January 2005. Between 1 February 2019 and 31 December 2019, Traffic Police (TP) enforced against 109 cases of pedal cyclists and 25 cases of PAB cyclists who failed to wear helmets when riding on the roads. "

update on drawdown of $200 million bicentennial community fund set up last year to match donations to institutions of a public character,"Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth whether an update can be provided on the drawdown of the $200 million Bicentennial Community Fund set up last year to match donations to Institutions of a Public Character (IPCs).","Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: The $200 million Bicentennial Community Fund (BCF) aims to encourage giving in the bicentennial year. It provides dollar-for-dollar matching of donations of up to $400,000 for an Institution of a Public Character (IPC), for the period from 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2020. IPCs are still raising donations and will only complete their submissions after 1 April 2020. IPCs can use these donations to bring their causes forward. The National Volunteer & Philanthropy Centre (NVPC) is the appointed administrator for the Fund.Based on applications received thus far, about 63% of IPCs have applied, with an estimated 70% utilisation of the Fund. The window of application for BCF matching is still open until 31 March 2020, and we encourage the remaining IPCs to consider applying for the Fund, and givers to continue supporting the causes and IPCs they are passionate about, to help the IPCs make a greater impact."
annual number of hdb's selective en-bloc redevelopment scheme projects in past 10 years and dwelling units affected,"Mr Ang Wei Neng asked the Minister for National Development (a) in the past 10 years, what is the number of HDB's Selective En-bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS) projects and the number of dwelling units affected, broken down on an annual basis; and (b) what are the challenges involving SERS projects.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Since 2010, eight public housing sites involving about 6,900 sold flats (or an average of 690 sold flats per year) have been announced for the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS).SERS involves compulsory acquisition and is done only on a limited basis, after taking into consideration various factors such as the redevelopment potential of the site, and the availability of suitable replacement sites nearby to rehouse the home-owners involved.  Given these restrictions, we do not expect many more sites to be eligible for SERS. This is why the Government has announced a new Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme (VERS) to more systematically redevelop and renew our older HDB towns.  "
rationale for hdb issuing temporary occupational licences over state land to people's association,"Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the rationale for HDB, as managing agent for SLA, to issue Temporary Occupation Licences (TOLs) over state land to entities such as the People's Association Citizens Consultative Committees for durations of several years at a time; and (b) what is the rate of fees charged to the People's Association for such TOLs.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Vacant State land can be put to interim use until the land is required for development. Typical uses include recreational, community, commercial, and other uses. HDB, as an agent of SLA, issues TOLs for the use of State land under its charge. Pursuant to the State Lands Rules, such TOLs are issued for a period not exceeding three years. TOL holders can apply to renew their license upon expiry. The duration of the TOL depends on the type of use, the duration requested by the applicant, and when the land is required for development. The TOL fee chargeable varies depending on the specific use. The rates for a list of common uses can be found on SLA's website."
reported cases of moulding on ceilings or walls of hdb flats in past three years and action taken,"Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for National Development (a) for the past three years, how many cases of moulding on ceilings or walls of HDB flats have been reported; and (b) what action does HDB take to address these complaints.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Mould formation is usually caused by insufficient ventilation, as high humidity encourages mould growth. Over the past three years, HDB has received an annual average of about 1.4 reported cases of mould per 1,000 dwelling units.Flat owners are responsible for the maintenance of the interior of their flats, including the ceilings and walls within their flats. Nevertheless, should HDB receive complaints about mould on the ceilings or walls of HDB flats, HDB will assist flat owners by providing advice on remedial repairs, and refer them to suitable repair contractors. If flat owners require financial assistance to pay for repair works, HDB will also refer them to the relevant community or grassroots organisations."
number of cases of water seepage from external walls of hdb flats reported and addressed in past three years,"Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for National Development (a) in the past three years, how many cases of water seepage from the external walls of HDB flats have been reported; (b) of those cases, how many are repeat complaints; and (c) whether HDB works with the town council to help address the water seepage issues.","Mr Lawrence Wong: The external walls of HDB flats are common property under the Town Councils' management and maintenance. Town Councils are responsible for keeping common property, including external walls, in good condition by carrying out regular and cyclical maintenance. Residents who encounter water seepage from external walls in their flat typically report it to the Town Council managing their estate. As such, HDB does not have the number of cases reported for water seepage from external walls. Where residents report such cases to HDB, HDB will help to refer these cases to the respective Town Council for follow-up. If Town Councils face difficulties in resolving water seepage from external walls, HDB also works with them to resolve the seepage issue."
update on review of developing different measures of inflation for different key demographic segments of singaporeans,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Trade and Industry what has been the result of the Ministry's review of developing different measures of inflation for different key demographic segments of Singaporeans beyond only segments by household income.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: The Department of Statistics (DOS) already compiles Consumer Price Indices for different household income groups, as well as retiree households. DOS is currently assessing the feasibility of developing Consumer Price Indices for other key demographic segments in Singapore. This process takes time as relevant data needs to be gathered, compiled and analysed. MTI and DOS will provide an update when ready."
number of hawkers and stalls providing only disposable utensils for dine-in customers and plans to introduce reusable utensils,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources with regard to the Zero Waste Masterplan (a) whether the Ministry is aware of the number of hawkers and stalls that are providing only disposable utensils for dine-in customers; and (b) whether there are measures or plans to encourage and ensure that these hawkers and stalls introduce reusable utensils for dine-in customers.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The National Environment Agency (NEA) has been working with stakeholders to reduce the use of disposables at hawker centres managed by NEA. NEA has disallowed their usage for dine-in meals at all seven new hawker centres, and at five existing hawker centres which have adopted the use of common crockery and centralised dishwashing services under the Productive Hawker Centres programme. In addition, from September 2018, NEA does not allow new cooked food stallholders who commence their tenancies at existing hawker centres to provide disposables to patrons for dine-in meals. NEA works closely with the Hawkers' Associations and our appointed operators to ensure that these stallholders do not use disposables for dine-in meals. NEA does not collect statistics on the number of stalls that provide disposable utensils for dine-in customers.NEA is actively engaging the remaining stallholders to phase out the use of disposables for dine-in meals. Some concerns that stallholders commonly cite are the cost of reusable crockery and the cost of manpower required to wash crockery. On this front, we are working to introduce centralised dishwashing services at more hawker centres, and we have a grant scheme in place to defray some of the costs. We will continue to engage stallholders through the Hawkers' Associations to encourage them to switch to reusables. At the national level, NEA launched the ""Say YES to Waste Less"" campaign in June 2019 to raise awareness of the impact of excessive consumption of disposables and the need for reduction. We are heartened that over 59 partners, covering more than 1,600 premises ranging from retailers, food and beverage establishments to supermarkets and hotels, have come forward to partner NEA in this endeavour. "
cleaning requirements and contracts in schools,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Education (a) how does the Ministry ensure that the gross floor area (GFA) for every school is accurately reflected in the cleaning tender specifications; (b) whether the Ministry consults every school on their cleaning requirements such as the number of classrooms and student population; and (c) whether the Ministry allows for contract variations in their cleaning contracts when there is a discrepancy in the GFA stated in the tender or there is an increase in GFA during the contract period.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: When calling for school cleaning tenders, key information like the GFA and toilet details, for example, number of cubicles, shower facilities, staff toilets, and so on of each school are provided to assist tenderers to price their bids. The GFA is taken from ""as-built"" information submitted to the building authority when the schools were developed or upgraded, and is further verified by MOE's Managing Agents prior to tender calling. Tenderers also visit a typical Primary school, Secondary school and Junior College to familiarise themselves with the nature and scope of services expected of them. Before a tender is called, schools will also provide input into the specifications so that their requirements are incorporated.The existing cleaning contract generally does not allow for price adjustments due to temporary changes or marginal discrepancies in GFA. Tenderers know that the numbers in the specifications serve as a guide, and it is in the interest of all parties not to have a tendering system that is too exact and detailed, as that will add administrative burden to everyone and can end up creating more disputes. However, if a new category of school infrastructure is added to an existing school site, such as adding a MOE Kindergarten, the price would be adjusted to include the new areas to be cleaned.  "
"update on ""reverse"" vending machines launched under recycle n save programme","Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what has been the popularity and usage of the 10 ""reverse"" vending machines launched under the Recycle N Save Programme on 31 October 2019; and (b) whether NEA has further plans to expand the Programme beyond the planned 50 machines across Singapore by March 2020.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The Reverse Vending Machine (RVM) pilot, introduced under the ""Recycle N Save"" initiative by the National Environment Agency (NEA) and F&N Foods, seeks to encourage Singaporeans to care for the environment and practise sustainability in their lives, by incentivising them to recycle their used plastic drink bottles and aluminium drink cans. The pilot has received positive response from the public since its launch on 31 October 2019. As of 12 January 2020, over 1.6 million drink containers in total have been deposited. Eleven RVMs have been rolled out and NEA and F&N Foods will work towards deploying the remaining 39 RVMs by end March 2020. The remaining RVMs will be deployed in a variety of locations to reach out to more users and residents in different parts of Singapore. My Ministry and the NEA will continue to work with stakeholders to monitor and review the results of the pilot. We will use the findings to assess how the ""Recycle N Save"" initiative supports our packaging including plastic waste management roadmap, including how we can accelerate plans to establish an Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) framework no later than 2025. We will continue to work with our partners and stakeholders to encourage the public to recycle more, and to recycle right."
"efforts to address attitudes of students and educators towards sexual objectification, harassment and abuse of women","Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Education what new efforts is the Ministry launching to address attitudes of students and educators towards the sexual objectification, harassment and abuse of women in light of serious concerns over voyeurism cases at the institutes of higher learning.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: MOE and the Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) are strongly against all forms of sexual misconduct, including voyeurism. Over the past year, the IHLs have reviewed and stepped up their efforts to tackle the issue of sexual misconduct holistically. They have implemented enhancements in four key areas.First, they have enhanced their education efforts for students and staff, emphasising what constitutes harm and violation, and the importance of respect for each other. These include briefings for students during orientation, online modules, face-to-face workshops, and regular outreach and awareness-building campaigns. Second, they have strengthened their disciplinary frameworks to impose tougher penalties for sexual misconduct, including expulsion where warranted.Third, they have enhanced campus infrastructure, including by expanding CCTV camera coverage and installing full-height partitions in restrooms.Fourth, they have strengthened support for victims by enhancing training for first responders and front-line staff, to equip them with the skills to support victims sensitively. They have also established 24-hour helplines for student care and dedicated victim care units at some IHLs, and enhanced counselling services."
expanding exceptions to concessions for levies on foreign domestic workers,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Ministry will consider expanding exceptions to concessions for levies on foreign domestic workers to help care-givers cope with situations where a disabled family member requires at least two persons to carry out any activities of daily living.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) recognises that there could be instances where families with care-giving duties would require two foreign domestic workers (FDW) to help care for persons with disabilities. Hence, on a case-by-case basis, the Ministry approves the work permit applications of up to two FDWs for one care recipient. However, each care recipient is eligible for the concessionary levy of $60 per month for only one FDW. This is to be fair to all employers whose care-giving needs vary.The Government provides further support for households who may need help to defray care-giving costs. For example, the Ministry of Health provides a Home Caregiving Grant (HCG), which is a monthly cash payout of $200 to defray the cost of care-giving for individuals with permanent moderate disability. The HCG payout can be used flexibly for different care-giving expenses, including the cost of hiring an FDW. FDW employers who wish to train their FDWs in care-giving can also tap the Care-givers Training Grant which is an annual training subsidy of $200 for each care recipient.The Government will continue to review and improve the range of home-based support measures to meet the needs of persons with disabilities and their care-givers. "
time taken for graduates to secure employment in past five years,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Education (a) over the past five years, what has been the trend in terms of time taken for graduates of Universities, Polytechnics and ITE to secure full-time employment; (b) what has been the trend in the proportion of such graduates taking up intern, contract or part-time positions as their first job after graduation; and (c) what are the causal factors underlying such trends.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: The Ministry of Education does not track the time taken by graduates to secure full-time employment. But the ability of graduates to secure employment six months after graduation has been tracked through the annual Graduate Employment Surveys, and published over the years. The survey results show that overall employment rate for Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) were 89%, 89%, 90%, 88% and 89% between 2014 and 2018, within six months of graduation. Among university graduates in the labour force, about 80% were in full-time permanent employment. Less than 10% were in part-time or temporary employment, mostly by choice. This trend has held stable over the past five years. However, Polytechnic and ITE graduates are much more likely to take up part-time or temporary work by choice, as they plan to go on to further studies. This has increased over the years with the expansion of upgrading pathways.Because of these reasons, the percentage of Polytechnic and ITE graduates in the labour force who take up part-time, temporary or freelance work six months after graduation has risen from 24% in 2014 to 31% in 2018. Almost all of this is by choice."
studies on impact of unmitigated workplace mental health issues on local workforce,"Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether there are any ongoing studies by the Ministry to examine how workplace mental health issues, if left unmitigated, can affect our local workforce; and (b) if so, when will the results of such studies be made public.","Mrs Josephine Teo: MOM is examining the impact of workplace mental health issues on our local workforce by tapping on completed studies by the Institute of Mental Health and National Council of Social Services. We also refer to global studies by the World Health Organization and International Labour Organization. MOM agrees that mental well-being at the workplace is important. To encourage more companies to put in place measures to support employees' mental well-being, the Total Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) programme initiated by the WSH Council and supported by the Health Promotion Board will assess employees' physical and mental well-being. The Total WSH consultants can also assist employers with stress management workshops and mental well-being talks, to support the mental well-being of their employees. We are initiating a pilot of iWorkHealth, a web-based psychosocial assessment tool to help employers and their employees to identify workplace stressors. The tool serves to raise awareness of workplace stressors and provide recommendations on areas where employers can work on to improve the mental well-being of their employees. The tool is targeted to be launched later this year."
placement quotas for employment agencies of foreign domestic workers,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether the Ministry sets quotas for employment agencies of foreign domestic workers to meet in terms of the number of domestic workers placed; (b) if so, whether this quota is applicable to all employment agencies or only those under Advance Placement Scheme; (c) what is the purpose of this quota; (d) how is the quota determined; and (e) what are the consequences of failure to meet the quota.","Mrs Josephine Teo: The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) does not set a quota on the number of foreign domestic workers (FDWs) to be placed by employment agencies (EAs). EAs which apply for and are approved by MOM to participate in the Advance Placement Scheme (APS) are however, encouraged to commit to bringing in 20 or more FDWs each month. This is to ensure a meaningful pool of FDWs whom employers with urgent caregiving needs can select from.The Ministry regularly monitors the placement volume of APS EAs. To date, no EA has been penalised for not keeping to its commitment. An EA, which makes the effort but is not able to bring in a steady and regular pool of APS FDWs, may still stay in the scheme. Only EAs that consistently fail to place any APS FDWs are dropped from the scheme. "
median salary of foreign domestic workers by nationality and experience,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Manpower what is the median salary of foreign domestic workers disaggregated by (i) nationality (ii) whether they are hired through the Eldercarer Foreign Domestic Worker Scheme and (iii) prior work experience in Singapore.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: Based on salaries declared by employers at the point of initial employment of their foreign domestic workers (FDWs), the median basic monthly salary over the past three years is $560. FDWs who had prior work experience in Singapore receive about $20 more per month. We do not provide nationality-based data to avoid invidious comparisons. The data also does not capture the impact of salary adjustments for longer-serving FDWs.  The basic monthly salaries of FDWs who were hired via the Eldercarer FDW Scheme vary from $400 to $1,000, with the median of about $570. The difference in median salaries should not be attributed solely to their Eldercarer training. It can also be a result of other factors, such as the type and length of training courses they have undergone, whether they had prior nursing training and experience, and the level of caregiving needs of the care recipients."
supply and demand for after-school care facilities and quality yardstick to assess student care centre operators,"Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) whether the current capacity of after-school care facilities is able to meet the demand; (b) what are the common reasons for appeal cases and feedback received from parents; (c) what is the breakdown in numbers regarding parents' feedback on affordability, capacity and services offered by Student Care Centres (SCCs); (d) whether the Ministry prescribes skill sets required of SCC personnel; and (e) whether there is a quality yardstick used to assess SCC operators.","Mr Desmond Lee: There are more than 400 Student Care Centres (SCCs) registered with the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) to administer the Student Care Fee Assistance (SCFA) scheme under ComCare. These registered SCCs provide around 42,000 student care places, with some 32,000 children enrolled in them. While actual demand varies across areas, enrolment is below capacity in all towns. Besides these registered SCCs, there are also other centres providing student care services that are not registered as SCFA administrators.Of the appeals and feedback received from parents relating to SCC, about half (43%) concern particular SCC specific issues, such as hygiene and child management. About 5% of feedback relates to affordability and 6% relates to capacity. The remaining feedback covers a range of issues from the enrolment process to the requirements imposed on registered SCCs. MSF provides guidelines to registered SCCs on recommended educational qualifications and training for their supervisors and staff. For example, MSF recommends the Workforce Skills Qualifications Introductory Student Care Centre Course, conducted by Ngee Ann Polytechnic, for new SCC staff. This course trains SCC staff to provide a safe, challenging, positive and developmentally appropriate physical environment for SCC students.All registered SCCs are required to meet stipulated standards in the areas of supervision, physical environment, operating hours, safety, health and hygiene, and provide a structured daily programme. MSF conducts audits on registered SCCs, which may include surprise checks, at least once every two years to ensure compliance. More frequent checks may be conducted as needed, for example, to look into feedback and complaints received, and where the SCC has weaknesses identified in previous audits."
"statistics on number of childcare centres located at workplaces, transport hubs and residential areas","Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what is the breakdown of the current number of childcare centres located at workplaces, transport hubs and residential areas respectively; (b) what is the number of childcare places available for each group; and (c) what kind of locations are anchor operators and partner operators offering their centres at.","Mr Desmond Lee: One of Government's key priorities is to ensure that parents have access to quality and affordable pre-schools for their children. This is to provide a good start for every child. To this end, the Early Childhood and Development Agency (ECDA) facilitates the development of child care centres (CCCs) in and near residential estates, community premises and at workplaces where there is demand.  Around two thirds (or 980) of all CCCs are located in HDB and private residential estates, with a total capacity of 107,000 places. One third (or 510) are located at or near workplaces – including commercial premises, Government buildings, and industrial estates – with a total capacity of 64,000. A small number are located in community premises, such as community centres. Of all these CCCs, 15% (or 210) are located in or near transportation hubs, that is, bus and MRT interchanges, with a total capacity of 26,000.  The large majority (or about 95%) of Anchor Operator (AOP) childcare centres are located in residential estates, as families have generally expressed a preference for childcare services close to their homes. The remaining 5% of AOP centres are located at or near workplaces. The Partner Operator (POP) scheme extends the range of affordable, quality options for families, with 60% of POP centres located in residential estates, and 40% located at or near workplaces. A small number of AOP and POP centres are also located in community premises. Of all these AOP and POP centres, 15% to 20% are located in or near transportation hubs.ECDA will continue to expand the provision of quality and affordable Government-supported pre-school places to cater to parents' needs and preferences."
data on number of children injured in motor accidents as a result of not being secured in child seats,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Health (a) whether hospitals collect data on the number of children injured in motor accidents as a result of not being secured in child seats; (b) if so, what is the number and percentage of children involved in such accidents in each of the past 10 years with a breakdown according to the age groups of (i) below one year old (ii) between one and two years old and (iii) above two years old; and (c) if not, whether hospitals will start collecting such data.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Based on data1 from the National Trauma Registry, between 2012 and 2018, the number of children aged 9 years and below2 who were treated in public hospitals for traumatic injury due to a motor vehicular accident ranged between 106 and 225 cases per year. We are not able to ascertain from the Registry's data whether children injured in motor vehicular accidents were a direct result of them not being secured in child car seats and/or seatbelts.Among those treated in public hospitals, more than half were known to have used car seats and/or restraints, while the status of the remainder is unknown. Motorists and their passengers should use appropriate restraints at all times while riding in motor vehicles. "
number of singaporean and foreign sex workers arrested and prosecuted for public solicitation in past 10 years,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Home Affairs for each year in the past 10 years, of the sex workers (i) arrested and (ii) prosecuted for public solicitation of prostitution, how many were Singaporeans and foreigners respectively.","Mr K Shanmugam: Soliciting in public is an offence under Section 19 of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act, or ""MOA"". Offenders are liable on conviction to a maximum fine of $1,000, and repeat offenders are liable on conviction to a maximum fine of $2,000 or maximum imprisonment of six months, or both.Between 2009 and 2018, Police made 281 arrests for public solicitation, which resulted in 181 prosecutions. The annual figures from 2009 to 2018 are in Table 1.Approximately one in four arrested persons and one in five prosecuted persons were Singapore citizens or Singapore Permanent Residents."
"demographics of patients receiving psychiatric treatment and mental health support at imh, polyclinics, specialist outpatient clinics and government-funded programmes","Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Health in the last three years, what are the demographics of patients receiving psychiatric treatment and mental health support at the Institute of Mental Health, polyclinics, Specialist Outpatient Clinics at restructured hospitals and under Government-funded programmes, such as the Assessment and Shared Care Team (ASCAT), Community Resource Engagement and Support Team (CREST) and Community Intervention Team (COMIT), respectively, broken down by (i) number of patients (ii) duration of inpatient stay or treatment length (iii) types of mental health condition (iv) age (v) income and (vi) time taken between onset of symptoms and treatment.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: The five most common mental health conditions that were seen at public hospitals were schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder and substance abuse. At the polyclinics, depression, anxiety and insomnia were the three most common mental health conditions. Schizophrenia and depression were also common mental health conditions receiving service from the community intervention teams funded under MOH. For the whole public healthcare system, the average age of subsidised patients for the different mental health conditions seen was between 40 to 50 years old1. MOH does not track data on income nor time taken between onset of symptoms and treatment as the patient might have seen providers outside the public healthcare system. However, based on the Singapore Mental Health Study (2016)2, a self-reported survey, the median time taken between the onset of symptoms and seeking help is 11 years for Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD); four years for bipolar disorder and alcohol abuse, two years for Generalised Anxiety Disorder and one year for Major Depressive Disorder. Stigma and lack of mental health literacy may be contributory factors to the delay. There are various initiatives by the Government, as well as healthcare and community providers to proactively reach out to raise awareness of mental conditions and provide information on avenues to seek help, facilitate early identification and access to interventions. We have community outreach teams to educate the public on mental health conditions and dementia, and refer those with such conditions to the appropriate health and/ or social services. We have also increased access to mental health and or dementia services in 12 polyclinics.   Over the last three years (2016 to 2018), the average number of subsidised patients who received inpatient treatment for mental health conditions was about 6,900 per year, with an average length of stay (ALOS) of 21 days per admission. The average number of subsidised patients seen as outpatients for mental disorders was about 60,000 per year.MOH will continue to work with public hospitals and service providers in the community, including schools, social service agencies and family service centres, to provide holistic support for all persons with mental healthcare needs and to ensure timely access to quality care and support. "
"median and average waiting times for outpatient appointments at imh, specialist outpatient clinics, polyclinics and government-funded programmes","Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the current median and average waiting times respectively for patients to outpatient appointments with (i) psychiatrists (ii) clinical psychologists and (iii) counsellors at Institute of Mental Health, Specialist Outpatient Clinics at restructured hospitals, polyclinics and under Government-funded programmes such as Assessment and Shared Care Team (ASCAT), Community Resource Engagement and Support Team (CREST) and Community Intervention Team (COMIT), respectively; (b) what is the professional to patient ratio for each of the above professions in each of the above medical centres and programmes; and (c) what are the measures taken to reduce waiting times.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: In 2018, the average overall median waiting time for new subsidised appointments across the public hospitals was 27 days1 to see a psychiatrist, and 28 days2 to see a psychologist. However, anyone requiring urgent mental health assistance or who wishes to see a psychiatrist, may contact the Institute of Mental Health's (IMH) 24-hour Mental Health Helpline3 or seek medical help at the 24-hour Emergency Services located at IMH. MOH does not have specific numbers of counsellors practising in Singapore as many healthcare professionals and social workers provide counselling as part of their work. For cases requiring community support, patients can be referred to Community Outreach Teams and Community Intervention Teams, and these cases are usually contacted within two weeks. There are around 2484 psychiatrists and 4735 psychologists practising in Singapore, which translates to 4.4 psychiatrists and 8.36 psychologists per 100,000 population. To reduce waiting time, the hospitals have implemented measures such as reviewing work processes to optimise appointment slots and efficiency of clinical operations (for example, calling patients prior to their appointment), tightening the triaging of urgency of cases, tiering services to the appropriate level of care, and right-siting of non-emergency or more stable cases to primary and community-based care to enable specialist services to focus on more complex cases. As of March 2019, we have set up 41 community outreach teams and, 21 allied health-led community intervention teams to provide mental health support in the community.  MOH will continue to work with public hospitals and service providers in the community, including schools, social service agencies and family service centres, to ensure that we provide holistic and timely support for persons with mental healthcare needs.  "
guidelines for suitable eye exercise and diet to help seniors take care of eyesight to delay onset of cataract,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry can implement a set of guidelines for suitable eye exercise and diet to help seniors take care of their eyesight to delay the onset of cataracts.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Cataract is one of the leading causes of blindness commonly associated with ageing. The risk of developing cataracts is higher if one regularly smokes or drinks alcohol, or has chronic diseases such as diabetes. MOH has efforts in place to promote general eye care amongst seniors. First, in prevention, the Health Promotion Board (HPB) conducts regular health talks in the community to equip seniors with bite-sized information to improve their physical, mental and functional health. Maintaining good eye health is one of the key topics, and seniors are taught the importance of good vision, early detection and management of common eye conditions, such as cataract and glaucoma, as well as simple eye care tips. Seniors can also obtain information on eye care and nutrition via the HealthHub website or app.Second, on early detection, we encourage our seniors to attend regular health screenings. In 2018, MOH partnered Temasek Foundation to roll out Project Silver Screen (PSS), a nationwide functional screening programme for seniors to check their vision, hearing and oral health. As part of the screening, seniors are advised on good eye care practices, and those with abnormal vision screening results are referred to an optometrist or eye specialist for further assessment. Since January 2018, more than 61,000 seniors have benefited from PSS, with about 20% referred for follow-up eye care services.  In addition, patients with diabetes, who are at higher risk of developing eye disorders, including cataract, are recommended to undergo regular eye screening as part of their routine care in polyclinics and Primary Care Network (PCN) General Practitioner clinics.Third, on accessibility, we have set up clinical eye care services in the community, particularly for seniors who may be less mobile. For example, MOH has worked with the public healthcare institutions (PHIs) to establish mobile eye services in the community, which provide in-depth visual testing to detect a wide range of eye conditions including cataract. The PHIs have also established six Community Eye Clinics (CECs) island-wide since June 2018, to provide prompt eye assessment and treatment for persons with stable eye conditions that do not require complex care by specialists. Specific to cataract management, optometrists and doctors at the CECs would also provide advice on monitoring symptoms, good eye health habits and appropriate follow-ups.  The above measures enable earlier detection and appropriate management of cataract and other vision disorders, so that our seniors can maintain their quality of life as far as possible. "
plans for mental health and allied professionals in social and health manpower development programme and community mental health masterplan,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Health (a) whether there are any manpower development plans for mental health and allied professionals in the Social and Health Manpower Development Programme and Community Mental Health Masterplan and, if so, what is the progress of these plans; (b) what are the targets the Ministry has for (i) psychiatrist to population ratio (ii) clinical psychologist to population ratio and (iii) counsellor to population ratio; and (c) when does the Ministry expect to achieve these target ratios.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Local training programmes are available for psychiatrists, psychologists and counsellors. Under MOH's Health Manpower Development Plan (HMDP), over the past three years, an average of three overseas experts from a variety of professions visited local healthcare institutions to advise and teach aspects of mental healthcare each year.  In addition, under the HMDP, an average of 13 local mental health professionals were sent to overseas centres to study and learn different models of care delivery each year. A Skills Framework (SF) was established in January 2019 to guide the developmental pathways of psychologists, including clinical psychologists. This framework for psychologists is administered by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF). MSF had also set up a Social Service SkillsFuture Tripartite Taskforce (STT) to drive, coordinate and implement tripartite collaborations for manpower development initiatives, including that for psychologists.Currently, there are about 2481 psychiatrists and 4732 psychologists in Singapore. This translates to 4.4 psychiatrists and 8.33 psychologists per 100,000 population. Within the public health sector, the number of psychiatrists and psychologist increased by 8% to 1824 and 7% to 171 respectively in the last three years. MOH does not have specific numbers of counsellors practising in Singapore as many healthcare professionals and social workers provide counselling as part of their work. Whilst there is no international consensus on the number or ratio of mental health professionals to population, the MOH will continue to monitor the numbers to ensure appropriate access and quality."
average duration to process appeals to withdraw from medisave accounts beyond annual withdrawal limit,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Health (a) over the past three years, what is the average duration taken to process appeals by persons who wish to draw from their MediSave accounts beyond the annual withdrawal limit; (b) what are the common reasons for those unsuccessful appeals; and (c) whether there have been appeals by similar persons for consecutive years and, if so, how are these appeals managed.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Appeals for additional MediSave withdrawal beyond these limits are assessed on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration circumstances of the patient and his family, such as whether more complex treatment was required, as well as the family's social and financial situation. In some appeal cases, the patient may already have low MediSave balances, or expect recurrent treatment in future years, and additional Medisave withdrawal may not be the only or the best solution. To ensure that these patients have enough MediSave for their future needs, we may instead refer such cases to Medical Social Workers for other forms of support, such as MediFund. For cases that are likely to face more complicated and challenging social and financial issues, MOH may work with other agencies, such as MSF and HDB, to coordinate support for these patients.In other cases, the patient may have sought unsubsidised care resulting in unexpectedly large bills. In such cases, we would encourage the patient to also work out alternative payment arrangements, such as payment through an instalment plan, instead of prematurely depleting their MediSave balances which would be needed in future. As it takes time to obtain information and assess a patient's financial and clinical circumstances, it generally takes around one month to process an appeal after we have received it. We will continue to review MediSave withdrawal limits and our healthcare financing schemes to ensure that they remain adequate and relevant. No Singaporean will be denied access to necessary and appropriate healthcare because of an inability to pay."
moh's response to recently-released community blueprint to end hiv and aids transmission by 2030,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Health what is the response of the Ministry to the recently released community blueprint to end HIV and AIDS transmission by 2030, especially the recommendations to triple the number of anonymous testing clinics and improve access to newer HIV medication.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: The ""Community Blueprint to End HIV transmission in Singapore"" has provided the community's perspective on the impact that HIV has on patients and their families, and recommendations to ending HIV in Singapore. The Ministry of Health (MOH) shares the community's aim in supporting people living with HIV and ending HIV transmission in Singapore. Various initiatives are currently in place to support HIV prevention and control efforts. These include programmes to increase awareness of HIV and lower barriers to testing, improve linkages to care for persons who test positive, and increase the affordability of HIV treatment. MOH has been working with Action for AIDs to engage with the community stakeholders on the Blueprint, and will continue to work with the community to strengthen the strategies to reduce HIV transmission, including measures to increase access to HIV testing and medication.  "
regulations governing cash advance programmes offered by employers or contractors,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Law (a) what regulations govern cash advance programmes offered by employers or contractors; and (b) whether the Ministry is considering a cap on interest rates instituted for such programmes.,"Mr K Shanmugam: Employers may provide advances of salaries to their employees prior to festive occasions, or upon request by their employees. The recovery of such cash advances are regulated under the Employment Act. Under the Act, employers are allowed to recover the monies through salary deductions of no more than 25% of the salary each month, for up to 12 months. The Employment Act does not provide for interest to be charged for such cash advances.Cash advance programmes offered by businesses to their contractors involving a sum of money lent in return for a larger sum may come under the ambit of the Moneylenders Act, depending on the nature and terms of the programme. Entities which offer cash advances as a business of moneylending require a licence or exemption under the Act. MinLaw may grant such licences or exemptions and impose conditions, including interest rates caps, as appropriate, taking into account the nature and terms of the programmes. "
allocation of national day parade tickets to migrant workers and new citizens,"Ms Yip Pin Xiu asked the Minister for Defence with regard to the National Day Parade (a) whether a meaningful number of tickets can be allocated to migrant workers given their contributions to the prosperity of our country; (b) if so, whether the Ministry will consider the number of years of service in Singapore as criteria for the allotment of these tickets; and (c) whether the Ministry plans to allocate a certain number of tickets for new citizens for the purpose of integration.","Dr Ng Eng Hen: As demand for tickets to the National Day Parade (NDP) are much higher than capacity, the priority of allocation will continue to be for Singaporeans and Permanent Residents, as the NDP is a key national event to celebrate our nation's independence together. Some previews are also reserved for school children as part of their national education.  Over the years, the NDP organising team has been expanding the overall capacity to respond to the high demand. Since 2016, a second Preview was added. Last year, the mobile column was extended into the heartlands. NDP celebrations have also been organised around the venues at the Padang or Floating Platform. These fringe and satellite activities allow tens of thousands more, including our migrant workers, to join the celebrations."
take-up of e-scooter trade-in-grant by delivery riders since introduction of transition assistance package,"Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Transport since the introduction of the Transition Assistance Package, how many delivery riders have switched to bicycles, power-assisted bicycles or personal mobility aids through the e-scooter Trade-In-Grant.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The Transition Assistance Package was designed to help food delivery riders switch out of e-scooters, through the e-scooter trade-in grant. As at 31 December 2019, LTA has received 3,550 applications from eligible riders and has approved all applications after accounting for duplicates. 74.6% of applicants applied to switch to power-assisted bicycles, 24.8% to bicycles, and 0.6% to personal mobility aids. So far, about 790 riders have successfully switched to alternative devices. The rest will progressively switch when they receive their new devices. In the meantime, their food delivery companies have provided them with free bicycle rentals."
action taken against riders using throttle-operated electric bikes in last five years and types of such bikes approved since passing of active mobility act in 2017,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Transport (a) for each year in the last five years, what is the number of cases where action has been taken against riders found using throttle-operated electric bikes; and (b) whether any type or case of throttle-operated electric bike has been approved for use since the passing of the Active Mobility Act in early 2017.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The Land Transport Authority has not approved any type of throttle-operated power-assisted bicycle (PAB) for use in Singapore since 2017. This is due to safety concerns with sudden accelerations associated with throttle-operated PABs. Action was taken against 1,863, 1,648, 406, 485 and about 837 cases of non-compliant PABs in 2015 to 2019 respectively, the majority of which involved throttle-based PABs."
proposal to build noise barriers along stretch of pie adjacent to hdb blocks between bukit batok road exit and toh guan road flyover,Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry will consider the feasibility of building noise barriers along the stretch of Pan-Island Expressway running adjacent to the HDB blocks between the Bukit Batok Road exit and Toh Guan Road flyover and/or implementing any other measure to reduce the traffic noise generated in the area.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The Land Transport Authority (LTA) is currently studying the feasibility of suitable noise mitigation measures along the highlighted stretch of the Pan-Island Expressway facing the housing blocks. The study includes options, such as noise barriers and noise-reducing pavement mix. LTA will decide on the measure(s) when the assessment is complete. LTA will consider factors such as the distance between the buildings and the road, and overall cost effectiveness."
lta's plan to expand shared path network by 2025,"Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Transport with regard to LTA's plan to expand the shared path network in Singapore to 750 kilometres by 2025, whether priority may be given to constituencies which do not presently have a shared path network.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The Land Transport Authority (LTA) had previously planned to extend the network of cycling paths from 440 kilometres to 750 kilometres by 2025 and 1,300 kilometres by 2030. We have decided to accelerate the pace of implementation, and in so doing, LTA will prioritise towns with high e-scooter populations and without existing intra-town cycling networks. LTA will work with local Advisors to ensure that new cycling paths meet their residents' needs."
plans to train singaporeans to pursue career in information technology,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Communications and Information what is being done to train Singaporeans to pursue a career in information technology.,"Mr S Iswaran: Digitalisation creates exciting opportunities for both Singaporeans and enterprises who seek to benefit from the growth of the digital economy. MCI and IMDA have a range of initiatives to help Singaporeans from diverse backgrounds seize new employment opportunities in information technology, as well as manage career challenges caused by digital disruption. These include upskilling courses for ICT professionals, reskilling courses for working Singaporeans who wish to move from other sectors into ICT job roles, and programmes to encourage students to embark on an ICT career. These initiatives are designed to help match and prepare Singaporeans with the demands and requirements of the new ICT job roles, so that they can fully benefit from the emerging job opportunities.For working adults hoping to pursue an ICT career, the TechSkills Accelerator (TeSA) programme provides training for ICT job roles that are in demand by the industry. To date, more than 93,000 training places have been taken up or committed since TeSA started in 2016. In total, more than 4,300 companies have upskilled their existing ICT workforce and a further 900 have employed individuals trained through TeSA. TeSA's Company-Led Training Programme works with private-sector companies to provide on-the-job training to fresh graduates and experienced professionals. Trainees build up their tech skills by working on industry projects and through interactions with tech practitioners and business users. As of October 2019, 50 companies have participated in the programme since its inception, and all trainees have secured full-time jobs upon completion of their training.For ICT professionals who wish to upskill themselves in emerging areas with strong industry demand, such as Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Cybersecurity and Internet of Things, the Critical Infocomm Technology Resource Programme Plus (CITREP+) helps them gain specialised ICT skills through short-form training and certifications.In addition, MCI and IMDA are stepping up efforts to ensure that mid-career PMETs and those hoping to take on an ICT job role are able to adapt to challenges brought about by technological changes in industry. The Tech Immersion and Placement Programme (TIPP) provides an immersive training course delivered by industry practitioners. As of October 2019, about 1,400 trainees have completed TIPP with a more than 90% job placement in companies ranging from start-ups to large enterprises. Mid-career professionals are also encouraged to leverage TeSA's integrated career services, a career support ecosystem, to get career guidance, mentoring, and support for better job matching. Our trade associations are also actively contributing their efforts to help locals. Under the Career Compass initiative, the Singapore Computer Society has provided experienced ICT mentors to partner with career centres managed by Workforce Singapore. SGTech has also been helping to manage some Professional Conversion Programmes with platform companies, such as Salesforce, to help train and place locals into jobs. MCI and IMDA will continue to provide Singaporeans with the means to reskill, upskill, and seize better job opportunities in the digital economy.In an increasingly technologically driven world, we must support future generations of Singaporeans to lead and thrive in the digital age. To interest school-going Singaporeans to develop ICT skills, IMDA has programmes such as the ""Code for Fun"" enrichment programme to inspire students and develop their computational thinking. IMDA's tertiary talent development programme provides scholarships and global exposure opportunities for tertiary students through immersion programmes and international competitions. For example, the Industry Preparation for Pre-graduates (iPREP) equips ITE, Polytechnic and University students with relevant skillsets for an ICT career through work attachments and overseas internships. Tertiary institutions have also expanded the number of places offered in ICT-related programmes to encourage more students to specialise in information technology.MCI will continue to work with our partners to enable Singaporeans to take on good ICT jobs and fully benefit from Singapore's growing digital economy."
percentage of non-residential buildings in singapore not green mark certified and plans to engage building owners,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what percentage of non-residential buildings in Singapore are currently not Green Mark certified; (b) whether there is a system for end users and the public to provide feedback on buildings that have their air-conditioning set to temperatures lower than necessary; and (c) how does the Ministry engage these building owners on their building's ambient air temperatures.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Buildings contribute up to a quarter of Singapore's carbon emissions. The ""greening"" of buildings play an important part in ensuring Singapore continues to develop sustainably and meet our international climate change commitments. Singapore is targeting to ""green"" 80% of our total building gross floor area (GFA) by 2030 and to date, about half of Singapore's non-residential building GFA has been greened to meet minimum sustainability standards. Today, users of air-conditioning in commercial buildings are encouraged to set their indoor temperatures at around 25 degrees Celsius through voluntary schemes like the BCA Green Mark (GM) scheme. The GM scheme recognises buildings for maintaining indoor temperature in air-conditioned space at 24 to 26 degrees Celsius. Under the scheme, recognition is also given for the installation of energy efficient air-conditioning systems. The latest Third Green Building Masterplan, launched in 2014, also focuses on changing the way building tenants and occupants consume energy. Aside from commercial buildings, the Government also works closely with industries on cooling efficiency. Starting from 2020, NEA will set Minimum Energy Efficiency Standards (MEES) for chilled water systems in industrial facilities. This will help companies reduce their energy consumption, save on energy costs, and avoid carbon emissions. To continue our efforts in combating climate change, my Ministry will work with BCA on programmes to encourage owners and tenants of non-residential buildings to reduce energy consumption and lower their carbon footprint."
countries with mutual agreements with singapore allowing residents to work in each other's country,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) how many countries have mutual agreements with Singapore to allow residents to work in each other's country; (b) which are the countries that allow Singaporeans to work in their countries; (c) what is the number of Singaporeans who have worked in each of these countries; and (d) in these countries, what are the professions/positions they are in.","Mr Chan Chun Sing: As there are no reporting requirements, we do not have the exact number of Singaporeans who are working in specific professions abroad. However, Singaporeans can work overseas under three broad categories of commitments. Firstly, under the World Trade Organisation (WTO) General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), Singaporeans working in companies with overseas presence may work in other WTO members as intra-corporate transferees (ICTs) for a specified number of years, depending on the commitments made by the host member.Secondly, Singaporeans may work in other countries with which we have Free Trade Agreements (FTAs). For example, Singaporean professionals can work in the United States via the H1B1 visa, which was made available to Singapore under the United States-Singapore FTA. Our FTA partners may also make more favourable commitments on Singaporean ICTs, such as by extending the number of years in which Singaporean ICTs may work in their country, going beyond their commitments made in the WTO GATS.  Thirdly, mutual recognition agreements (MRAs) and memoranda of understanding (MOUs) signed by our professional bodies allow Singaporean qualifications and licences to be recognised overseas, and vice versa, enhancing the mobility of our professionals. For instance, through the MRA between Singapore's Institution of Engineers and the Royal Netherlands Society of Engineers signed in July 2018, Singaporean Chartered Engineers whose qualifications are recognised may practice in The Netherlands and vice versa.

MCI and IMDA will continue to provide Singaporeans with the means to reskill, upskill, and seize better job opportunities in the digital economy.In an increasingly technologically driven world, we must support future generations of Singaporeans to lead and thrive in the digital age. To interest school-going Singaporeans to develop ICT skills, IMDA has programmes such as the ""Code for Fun"" enrichment programme to inspire students and develop their computational thinking. IMDA's tertiary talent development programme provides scholarships and global exposure opportunities for tertiary students through immersion programmes and international competitions. For example, the Industry Preparation for Pre-graduates (iPREP) equips ITE, Polytechnic and University students with relevant skillsets for an ICT career through work attachments and overseas internships. Tertiary institutions have also expanded the number of places offered in ICT-related programmes to encourage more students to specialise in information technology.MCI will continue to work with our partners to enable Singaporeans to take on good ICT jobs and fully benefit from Singapore's growing digital economy."
percentage of non-residential buildings in singapore not green mark certified and plans to engage building owners,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what percentage of non-residential buildings in Singapore are currently not Green Mark certified; (b) whether there is a system for end users and the public to provide feedback on buildings that have their air-conditioning set to temperatures lower than necessary; and (c) how does the Ministry engage these building owners on their building's ambient air temperatures.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Buildings contribute up to a quarter of Singapore's carbon emissions. The ""greening"" of buildings play an important part in ensuring Singapore continues to develop sustainably and meet our international climate change commitments. Singapore is targeting to ""green"" 80% of our total building gross floor area (GFA) by 2030 and to date, about half of Singapore's non-residential building GFA has been greened to meet minimum sustainability standards. Today, users of air-conditioning in commercial buildings are encouraged to set their indoor temperatures at around 25 degrees Celsius through voluntary schemes like the BCA Green Mark (GM) scheme. The GM scheme recognises buildings for maintaining indoor temperature in air-conditioned space at 24 to 26 degrees Celsius. Under the scheme, recognition is also given for the installation of energy efficient air-conditioning systems. The latest Third Green Building Masterplan, launched in 2014, also focuses on changing the way building tenants and occupants consume energy. Aside from commercial buildings, the Government also works closely with industries on cooling efficiency. Starting from 2020, NEA will set Minimum Energy Efficiency Standards (MEES) for chilled water systems in industrial facilities. This will help companies reduce their energy consumption, save on energy costs, and avoid carbon emissions. To continue our efforts in combating climate change, my Ministry will work with BCA on programmes to encourage owners and tenants of non-residential buildings to reduce energy consumption and lower their carbon footprint."
countries with mutual agreements with singapore allowing residents to work in each other's country,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) how many countries have mutual agreements with Singapore to allow residents to work in each other's country; (b) which are the countries that allow Singaporeans to work in their countries; (c) what is the number of Singaporeans who have worked in each of these countries; and (d) in these countries, what are the professions/positions they are in.","Mr Chan Chun Sing: As there are no reporting requirements, we do not have the exact number of Singaporeans who are working in specific professions abroad. However, Singaporeans can work overseas under three broad categories of commitments. Firstly, under the World Trade Organisation (WTO) General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), Singaporeans working in companies with overseas presence may work in other WTO members as intra-corporate transferees (ICTs) for a specified number of years, depending on the commitments made by the host member.Secondly, Singaporeans may work in other countries with which we have Free Trade Agreements (FTAs). For example, Singaporean professionals can work in the United States via the H1B1 visa, which was made available to Singapore under the United States-Singapore FTA. Our FTA partners may also make more favourable commitments on Singaporean ICTs, such as by extending the number of years in which Singaporean ICTs may work in their country, going beyond their commitments made in the WTO GATS.  Thirdly, mutual recognition agreements (MRAs) and memoranda of understanding (MOUs) signed by our professional bodies allow Singaporean qualifications and licences to be recognised overseas, and vice versa, enhancing the mobility of our professionals. For instance, through the MRA between Singapore's Institution of Engineers and the Royal Netherlands Society of Engineers signed in July 2018, Singaporean Chartered Engineers whose qualifications are recognised may practice in The Netherlands and vice versa. "
annual funding provided to mediacorp for past five years,Mr Ang Wei Neng asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) how much funding is provided for MediaCorp on the annual basis for the past five years; (b) how many (i) TV and (ii) radio programmes have been funded by the Government for the past five years; and (c) whether the funding is sufficient given the decreasing amount of advertising dollars that MediaCorp can generate over the years.,"Mr S Iswaran: The Government has allocated about $310 million annually to support Public Service Broadcasting (PSB) programmes over the last five years. The funding supports the provision of an average of 3,000 hours of TV programmes a year across MediaCorp's Free-to-Air TV channels and in the four official languages. The funding also supports the development of capabilities and digital platforms to complement PSB programming. PSB funding for radio supports the Malay and Tamil radio stations Warna, Ria and Oli, dialect news broadcasts on Capital 958FM, and programming on Symphony 924FM and CNA 938FM.   The Government recognises that the media landscape and media consumption habits are rapidly changing. The entry of many international content providers into the market has also intensified the competition for local viewers. These changes have brought about challenges for public service broadcasters around the world.In light of these trends, MediaCorp is taking steps to innovate and transform its business model and content offerings to better serve its audience. The Government regularly reviews its funding for PSB programmes to ensure value for money and that Singaporeans continue to enjoy high quality PSB programmes that meet the diverse needs of our communities."
number and profile of workers in general waste collection and materials recovery sub-sectors,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what is the current total number of workers and corresponding workforce profile in both general waste collection and the materials recovery sub-sectors; and (b) what are the various deciles for both monthly basic and gross wages in the two sub-sectors.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Based on the 2016 Waste Management Industry Manpower Study commissioned by the National Environment Agency (NEA) and the Workforce Singapore (WSG), there are about 7,900 workers in the general waste collection sub-sector, and about 6,500 workers in the materials recovery sub-sector. The study contains wage data for individual job functions in the general waste collection and materials recovery sub-sectors. This includes managers, supervisors, machine operators, waste and recyclables truck drivers, collection and sorting crew. The core operational roles of the workforce would be the waste and recyclables collection and sorting crew, as well as supervisors and drivers.For waste and recyclables collection workers, the annual basic wages are $11,960, $14,040 and $16,952 at the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile respectively. The corresponding annual gross wages are $19,458, $25,193 and $31,144 respectively. For recyclables sorters, the annual basic wages are $10,400, $11,700 and $14,400 at the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile respectively. The corresponding annual gross wages are $13,173, $16,200 and $23,464 respectively.For waste and recyclables collection supervisors, the annual basic wages are $30,875, $35,490 and $38,545 at the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile respectively. The corresponding annual gross wages are $45,935, $52,538 and $64,468 respectively. For sorting and recycling plant supervisors, the annual basic wages are $22,198, $29,300 and $40,430 at the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile respectively. The corresponding annual gross wages are $32,500, $45,061 and $57,000 respectively.For waste collection and recyclables truck drivers, the annual basic wages are $22,100, $23,660 and $28,860 at the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile respectively. The corresponding annual gross wages are $36,000, $44,476 and $52,741 respectively.The next Environmental Services Industry Manpower Study, which will cover both Cleaning and Waste Management sectors, will be commissioned by the NEA in 2020."
review of executive condominium scheme for better control over pricing,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development whether HDB will review the Executive Condominium (EC) scheme to take over the full development of ECs instead of opening land sales to private developers so as to have better control over the pricing of ECs to meet the aspiration needs of Singaporeans.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The Executive Condominium (EC) Housing Scheme was introduced to provide an affordable option for higher-income Singaporeans who aspire to own private housing. That is why ECs offer similar design features and facilities as private condominiums, and are treated as strata-titled private housing after 10 years. Given this objective, it would not be possible for HDB to take over the development of ECs.  The Government has put in place various measures to ensure that ECs remain affordable. For example, initial eligibility and ownership restrictions, such as an income ceiling and a minimum occupation period, are imposed on EC buyers. This helps to reduce the land cost of the EC projects, as well as their selling price. Currently, the prices of ECs are about 25% cheaper than private condominiums of similar size and location. EC buyers also benefit from the CPF Housing Grant when making their purchase. We will continue to monitor the situation, and ensure that the EC Housing Scheme serves its original intent, and meets the aspirations and needs of potential home-buyers.  "
review of ban on keeping of pet cats in hdb flats,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for National Development whether it is timely now to remove the ban on keeping pet cats in HDB flats and to regulate cat pet-keeping instead to minimise disamenities for neighbours.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB's pet ownership policies have to strike a balance between residents who are pet lovers and those who are not. Irresponsible pet ownership can lead to disamenities in the community and cause unhappiness. In the case of cats, disamenities include shedding fur, defecating/urinating in public areas, and caterwauling by roaming cats. Notwithstanding these concerns, HDB recognises that there are many residents who are cat lovers and who would like to keep cats in their flats. Hence, HDB will continue to review and update its pet ownership policies, together with NParks/Animal & Veterinary Service which is responsible for the broader issue of animal welfare and licensing. While we would like very much to accommodate the wishes of all pet owners, we also have to take into consideration the views of other home-owners, and take a holistic and balanced approach in addressing this issue.  "
involving members of public in reporting decaying or unhealthy trees,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry can (i) issue a set of pointers to help the public look out for trees that may be decaying or unhealthy and (ii) provide a hotline number for people to report such instances so that the community can be an additional check to the already tight regime of inspection done by NParks.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Assessing the health and structural integrity of trees is best carried out by trained personnel with the requisite experience and expertise. For instance, natural features on certain types of trees could be mistaken by the public as signs of tree decay or disease, when these trees are in fact healthy. Members of the public who have feedback on public trees can contact NParks at 1800-471-7300, or through the OneService app of the Municipal Services Office."
statistics on flat owners unable to sell their flats within grace period after collection of keys to new flats,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development (a) to date, how many flat owners could not sell their flats after the grace period given to them after the collection of keys to their new flats; and (b) whether the number has been the increasing for the past three years.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Existing flat owners who are collecting the keys to a new or resale HDB flat have up to six months to sell or transfer their interest in the existing flat. The number of households unable to do so today is around 600, similar to 2017. "
statistics on adoption of absentee payroll under workfare training support scheme,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Manpower since the absentee payroll under the Workfare Training Support (WTS) Scheme was first introduced (a) how many companies and workers have benefited and what is the total amount disbursed on a yearly basis; and (b) what is the breakdown of the companies by industry sectors that have benefited from WTS.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: Over the past five years, an average of around 3,000 companies and 31,000 workers have benefited from absentee payroll funding1 each year under the Workfare Training Support (WTS) Scheme. The average amount disbursed yearly is about $6 million. See Table 1 for details.  The breakdown of the top industry sectors with the most number of companies benefiting from absentee payroll funding is in Table 2. These are broadly sectors with a higher proportion of low-wage workers. "
complaints of and action taken against employment discrimination,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether the refusal by employers in the retail sector to interview and/or hire a qualified job applicant on grounds that he or she wears articles of religious faith constitutes a violation of the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices; (b) how many complaints of discrimination on these grounds has TAFEP received in the past five years, broken down by industry; and (c) what actions has TAFEP taken against these employers.","Mrs Josephine Teo: All employers are expected to abide by the principles of fair employment practices set out in the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices (TGFEP), which makes it clear that recruitment and hiring practices are to be based on merit and the ability to perform the job. Religious wear should generally be allowed at workplaces, unless employers have uniform or dress code requirements which are suited to the nature of their work, or for operational and safety reasons. Such requirements should then be communicated and explained clearly to employees as well as job applicants. In the past five years, the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) received a total of 16 complaints related to the wearing of religious articles, or less than 1% of all the complaints received. Table 1 shows the breakdown by industry of the complaints received. Most complaints arose due to insensitivity on the part of the employer or interviewer in communicating company’s dress code and practices. All the employers have heeded TAFEP's advice and made the necessary rectifications to their employment practices.TAFEP investigates all complaints of workplace discrimination, including unreasonable restrictions against religious wear, and will work with the Ministry of Manpower to take enforcement actions against substantiated complaints. "
plans to ensure singaporeans' readiness in technology-driven economy,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Education (a) what is being done to ensure that Singaporeans will be ready for an economy heavily driven by technology; and (b) what is being done now to train Singaporeans to take up jobs in the field of information technology.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: Our approach is not to teach technology or information technology through a single subject but through a multi-faceted, immersive experience. At the Primary and Secondary levels, students have many opportunities to develop their interest in information technology including through enrichment programmes, such as Code for Fun and Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs). Secondary students can participate in technology-related Applied Learning Programmes (ALP) and formal Computing subjects. Moving ahead, these opportunities will be expanded further. For example, starting in 2020, all primary students will now participate in the Code For Fun enrichment programme. Also, starting in 2023, some primary schools will offer ALPs in technology-related areas, such as health science, robotics and coding. We also need to recognise that the foundation of technology-related competencies lie in Mathematics and Science, which are also traditional strengths of our education system.  We must therefore continue to focus on these subjects in school, and encourage students with the interest to take up STEM subjects or courses. For example, those with a special talent or interest in computing can offer O-Level and A-Level Computing in selected schools, and develop key skills to pursue their interest further at the post-secondary level.The Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) offer many STEM-related pathways in engineering, information technology, data analytics and artificial intelligence. They regularly refresh the curriculum to ensure that they are up to date with the latest developments in technology and industry demands.  The IHLs also ensure students possess baseline competencies needed in the digital economy. For example, all Polytechnic and Institute of Technical Education (ITE) students have to complete a module on data analysis for problem solving, and students at National University of Singapore (NUS), Nanyang Technological University (NTU), and Singapore Management University (SMU) all undergo modules on computational thinking. Even after leaving school, Singaporeans can continue to stay abreast with technology through various SkillsFuture courses. These subsidised courses are offered across different proficiency levels, and help Singaporeans stay relevant in the digital workplace. Singaporeans who wish to move into ICT jobs can also take advantage of TechSkills Accelerator programmes to acquire relevant and in-demand digital skills."
statistics on singaporeans obtaining first degree from local public universities and private universities in last five years and their median starting pay,"Mr Ang Wei Neng asked the Minister for Education (a) how many Singaporeans have obtained their first degree from the local public universities as opposed to private universities in Singapore in the past five years; and (b) what is the median starting pay of graduates, excluding medical and dental school graduates, from public and private universities in Singapore.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: MOE has been monitoring the number of students in private education institutions (PEIs) offering external degree programmes closely. This is because unlike Autonomous Universities and publicly-funded degree courses, we do not have direct oversight of the institutions and their programmes. However, we do regulate them to ensure that systems and processes are in place to protect students' interest.Over the years, we have tightened the regulations on these PEIs. One of the new requirements introduced two years ago was to conduct graduate employment surveys and make results public so students can make more informed choices. The latest survey results showed that the median starting salary for graduates of private Universities is $2,650, compared to $3,500 for Autonomous Universities, and $2,501 for Polytechnic graduates who have completed their National Service.Over the past five years, the number of Singaporeans who were admitted into PEIs undergoing full-time degree programmes have decreased from 8,200 to 6,100.This is partly because of the tighter regulations and transparency in graduate outcomes. More importantly, between 2014 and 2018, the cohort participation rate was raised from 32% to close to 40%. The annual number of Singaporeans admitted into full-time undergraduate programmes in our AUs increased from 14,800 to 17,100 over the same period, even while cohort sizes have fallen."
median and average amounts of unused balances in post-secondary education account transferred to cpf ordinary accounts for each cohort in last three years,"Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for Education regarding the Post-Secondary Education Account (PSEA) (a) for the last three years, what percentage of each cohort had unused balances in their PSEA which were transferred to their CPF Ordinary Accounts; and (b) for the cohorts in (a), what are the median and average amounts of unused balances so transferred.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: Over the past three years, about 90% of PSEA accounts have balances that can be transferred to the CPF-OA. It is not a bad thing to have some balances to transfer to CPF-OA, because the monies can then be used for housing and other purposes. The median and average amounts transferred were $460 and $742 respectively in 2016, $782 and $943 in 2017, and $748 and $1,013 in 2018. The amounts are increasing as the relevant cohorts have different starting balances and received different amounts of top ups before they reach 30 years of age."
feedback exercises with workers filing discrimination or workplace harassment reports and their satisfaction with follow-up actions taken,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) conducts feedback exercises with workers who have filed a discrimination or workplace harassment report with TAFEP which resulted in follow-up action by TAFEP or the Ministry; and (b) if so, what are the results of the feedback, particularly as to whether complainants are satisfied with the outcome of their case and the follow-up action taken.","Mrs Josephine Teo: Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) investigates all complaints received. Where warranted, cases are referred to the Ministry of Manpower. Where action has been taken against the employer, TAFEP will keep the complainant updated on the outcome. Many have been thankful and appreciative of the help and support to address their concerns. "
percentage of requests for personal protection orders made by foreign spouses against their husbands in past three years,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) of all requests for Personal Protection Orders in each year for the past three years, how many and what percentage have been made by foreign spouses against their husbands; and (b) how many and what percentage of such requests by foreign spouses have been approved.","Mr Desmond Lee: Persons who seek legal protection from family violence may apply at the Family Justice Courts (FJC), for a Personal Protection Order (PPO) under the Women's Charter. Based on the most recent complete dataset, FJC received 2,811 PPO applications in 2016, of which 203 applications (7%) were filed by foreign wives against their husbands. One hundred and one orders (50%) were issued, while the remaining applications filed by foreign wives in 2016 were mainly withdrawn, dismissed or struck out."
data on private sector bonuses and their correlation with civil service bonuses,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether the Ministry keeps track of private sector bonuses given out each year; and (b) whether the Ministry has discerned any pattern whereby private sector bonuses tend to be causally correlated with civil service bonuses.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: The Ministry of Manpower conducts annual surveys on wage practices, and publishes the data in our annual Report on Wage Practices. The report includes data on the quantum of the annual variable component (AVC) – in other words, the bonuses – given by private establishments.  As we reported in the 2018 Report, the performance of establishments and individuals were employers' main considerations when determining bonuses. These factors are not affected by civil service bonuses."
breakdown of number and percentage of divorce cases where shared care and control of children is awarded,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Social and Family Development for 2017 and 2018 respectively, what is the respective breakdown of the number and percentage of divorce cases where shared care and control of the children is awarded.",Mr Desmond Lee: We are working with the Family Justice Courts and the Syariah Court to collate the data and will share this when ready.
"plans to encourage innovative solutions to climate change in entrepreneurship, engineering and sciences","Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources what is being done to encourage innovative solutions to climate change in the fields of entrepreneurship, engineering and the sciences.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Climate change brings new existential threats. Singapore is already experiencing warmer temperatures, more intense rainfall and prolonged dry spells. Being an island state, we are also vulnerable to sea level rise. Just like how we have tackled other existential challenges in the past, we will plan ahead and invest in innovative solutions to reduce emissions as well as protect Singapore against the impacts of climate change.We are making hefty investments in research and development (R&D) to develop solutions to decarbonise our grid, industries, and even our buildings. Nine hundred million dollars has been set aside for the Urban Solutions and Sustainability domain under our national Research, Innovation and Enterprise plan. We are working closely with industry and academic partners to develop as well as deploy innovative technologies and resource-efficient solutions that not only address our local challenges, but can also be applicable to other urban centres. For example, we are driving the adoption of super-low energy and zero-energy buildings and working closely with industry to implement more carbon-efficient processes.Singapore is alternative energy-disadvantaged. Nevertheless, we are working to maximise the deployment of solar energy, our most feasible source of renewal energy. To overcome our land constraints, PUB has conducted floating solar photovoltaic (PV) cell test-bed in Tengeh Reservoir to study the performance and cost-effectiveness of 10 different PV systems. Following the study, PUB has sought proposals from companies to build a large-scale floating solar PV system in Tengeh Reservoir (of at least 50 megawatt-peak), and deploy two smaller systems in Bedok and Lower Seletar Reservoirs. We are also studying and developing technologies in other areas, including studying the potential of ""clean fuels"", such as hydrogen, and carbon capture, utilisation and storage.   Mitigation and adaptation must go hand-in-hand as we are mindful that we are unable to reverse climate change completely. We have placed equally strong emphasis on the sciences in our adaptation plans because Singapore’s climate change policies must be based on robust climate science. We established the Centre for Climate Research Singapore (CCRS) in 2013 and today, CCRS is one of the few dedicated centres in the region that focuses on research in tropical weather and climate. CCRS will set up a new Programme Office next year to drive the formulation and implementation of our national climate science research masterplan and systematically build up climate science capabilities across our research institutes and universities.To deepen our knowledge in a complex and multi-disciplinary issue like sea level rise, CCRS recently launched a call for research proposals for the National Sea Level Programme (NSLP) grant. The NSLP brings together both local and international experts to integrate and analyse various domain areas in sea level rise, and customise it to our local context. To protect our coasts, low-lying areas and communities from sea level rise, we are exploring various coastal protection technologies and solutions, including learning from the experience of other countries. For example, we are building a small polder at Pulau Tekong to gain experience in operating one. Our agencies will also undertake R&D to enhance the cost-effectiveness of coastal protection solutions. Even as we pursue innovative solutions, we will need to harness the collective efforts of the Government, businesses, civil society and Singaporeans to fight climate change."
disbursements of public monies to citizens’ consultative committee and community development and welfare funds in last three years,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) in each of the last three years, what is the breakdown of public monies disbursed to (i) Citizens' Consultative Committee (CCCs) and (ii) Community Development and Welfare Funds (CDWFs) respectively; (b) what is the criterion used by CCCs and CDWFs to (i) assess eligibility for financial assistance to needy residents and (ii) Citizens' Consultative Committee ComCare Fund (CCF); (c) what is the amount of assistance, broken down by types of assistance, rendered by CCF; (d) what is the mean and median duration of assistance provided to residents through the CCF; and (e) how should residents apply for assistance from CCC, CDWF and CCF respectively.","7 Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) what are the respective roles of grassroots advisors (GAs) and elected Members of Parliament (MPs) in deciding (i) leadership and (ii) membership of grassroots leaders appointed by People's Association (PA); (b) how are GAs and MPs respectively empowered to influence the operations and decisions of (i) Citizens' Consultative Committees (CCCs) and (ii) Community Development and Welfare Fund (CDWFs); and (c) whether the Citizens' Consultative Committee ComCare Fund (CCF) applications and CDWF disbursements are decided by GAs or MPs.Mr Chan Chun Sing (for the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth): Members of Parliament (MPs) are elected to represent their constituents in Parliament, to debate and make laws. They conduct Meet-the-People sessions and lead their town councils in managing the municipal operations and issues of the estates.The role of Grassroots Advisors (GRAs) is different from that of MPs. GRAs are appointed by the People’s Association (PA), a statutory board under the MCCY. The PA's role is to promote social cohesion, and to act as a bridge between the Government and the people. The PA appoints GRAs to guide its grassroots organisations (GROs) in communicating and implementing the policies and programmes of the Government of the day. These include difficult and unpopular policies which are necessary for the good of Singapore, such as CPF cuts during the 1986 recession, the increase in retirement age and the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA). In appointing GRAs, the PA therefore looks to those whom can be entrusted to carry out this role faithfully.Similarly, the PA appoints grassroots leaders, including volunteers who serve on the Citizens' Consultative Committees (CCC). Among other things, the CCCs help the PA to administer Government and local schemes such as the Community Development and Welfare Fund (CDWF) and CCC ComCare Fund (CCF), based on established criteria.  The CDWF supports community bonding programmes and welfare assistance for needy residents. The CDWF Committee, appointed by the CCC, manages and oversees the disbursement of funds. Those applying for welfare assistance under CDWF should minimally fulfil the following criteria:(a) Residents of the constituency or Division of Group Representation Constituency (GRC) where the CCC serves; and(b) Singapore Citizens or Permanent Residents (PRs) or their children must be Singapore Citizen or PR.Established under the ComCare Endowment Fund (ComCare), the CCF offers interim assistance to needy residents who require urgent and temporary financial relief. The CCC helps to administer the scheme based on the eligibility criteria set by MSF. For the amount and duration of assistance rendered by CCF, the CCCs can grant up to three months of financial assistance per application, capped at $200 per month. Residents with longer term financial needs will be referred to the MSF's Social Service Offices. Residents can apply for both the CDWF and CCF at the Community Centres/Clubs. In instances where applications for the CCF or CDWF do not meet the eligibility criteria, the CCC and CDWF committee may seek the help of the GRA to identify and connect residents with other sources of government and community support.Based on an average of Financial Year (FY) 2016 to FY2018, the amount of direct grant given by PA to the CCCs and CDWFs is about $290,000 per CCC and $9,000 per CDWF per FY. These grants are used towards welfare assistance and community bonding programmes."
study on special education policy framework in british columbia and plans to review career paths of educators in special needs sector,"Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Education (a) whether there have been efforts to study the Special Education Policy Framework in British Columbia or other similar policy framework elsewhere; (b) if so, what are the key findings for such studies; (c) whether the Ministry is reviewing career paths of allied educators and educators in the special needs sector; and (d) what are the efforts to recruit more educators in the sector.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: MOE has studied a number of international models for supporting students with Special Educational Needs (SEN). The models differ, reflecting the specific context of each jurisdiction. British Columbia, for example, places great emphasis on the mainstreaming of students with SEN. However, other education authorities such as that in the UK recognise that the educational needs of children with higher needs are better met in more specialised settings, and are setting up more specialised schools and units for children with SEN.In Singapore, we have adopted a multi-pronged approach, so as to cater to the diverse range of educational needs of students with SEN. Hence, around 80% of students with SEN, including many with dyslexia, Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), as well as the majority of students with sensory and physical impairment, are in mainstream schools. The rest who have moderate-to-severe SEN, are in Special Education (SPED) schools. That way, students with moderate-to-severe SEN can benefit from a highly customised curriculum and pedagogy, delivered by specially-trained SPED teachers, and supported by a range of allied professionals such as psychologists and therapists. Having well-trained staff is key to the quality of support for students with SEN. In mainstream schools, all Allied Educators (Learning and Behavioural Support) [AED(LBS)] undergo the Diploma in Special Education (DISE) programme at the National Institute of Education (NIE). In 2016, MOE enhanced the career structure, progression and development of AED(LBS), including creating higher appointments, such as Lead AED(LBS), Master AED(LBS) and Chief AED(LBS) to lead the fraternity at the school cluster, zonal and national levels. MOE enhanced professional development opportunities for AED(LBS) through modular training, conferences and milestone programmes, and offer scholarships and awards to AED(LBS) for further studies. The number of SPED teachers has increased by about 40% since 2014, to meet the needs of the growing enrolment of students with SEN. MOE and NCSS will continue to support mainstream and SPED schools in the recruitment of educators with appropriate skill-sets and aptitude to teach students with moderate-to-severe SEN. "
heat stroke and dehydration cases in last three years and measures to protect workers against excessive heat,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how does heat stress arising from climate change impact upon work productivity; (b) what is the number of heat stroke and dehydration cases in the last three years; (c) how does the Ministry ensure that employers in construction, marine and public works protect workers against excessive heat; (d) whether the Ministry will consider requiring employers to record incidents of heat stroke and dehydration; and (e) whether the Ministry will develop workplace guidelines on heat stress, including that requiring of higher water intake and longer rest periods for affected employees.","Mrs Josephine Teo: In the last three years, 10 workers suffered injuries caused by heat stress or work-related heat disorders, of which one was fatal. They comprised less than 0.03% of all workplace injuries and occupational diseases in the same period.  MOM together with the Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Council, has developed the WSH Guidelines on Managing Heat Stress in the Workplace. The guidelines inform employers to conduct risk assessments associated with heat stress and the precautionary actions they should take to prevent heat stress at work. These include acclimatising newly arrived workers who come from colder climates, providing regular rest breaks at shaded areas, making cool drinking water accessible, and educating workers on the symptoms and seriousness of heat-related disorders.The WSH Council has also been disseminating information on heat-related safety and health risks through its website, the WSH bulletin1, as well as collaterals such as the Heat Stroke Card. Heat stress is also included in the WSH Council's Total WSH Programme. Total WSH consultants are expected to advise companies on what they can do to protect workers from heat stress.Heat stroke and dehydration are already included in the types of work incidents that are reportable. From 1 September 2020, the reporting requirement will be extended to incidents that result in any instance of MC or light duty.                    "
plans to support mothers re-entering workforce with difficulty matching employment hours with opening hours of childcare services,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Manpower what is being done to support mothers re-entering the workforce who may experience difficulty matching their employment hours with the opening hours of childcare services.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: To cater to the needs of working parents, including mothers re-entering the workforce, childcare centres are required to operate from 7 am to 7 pm on weekdays, and from 7 am to 2 pm on Saturdays. This arrangement meets the needs of most parents, without extending the working hours of childcare centre workers. For families working shifts or on weekends, many of them arrange for other care-givers, such as grandparents and relatives, to help out. Some centres may extend their services, taking into consideration demand and resources. Currently, around 55 centres operate beyond 7 pm on weekdays.Mothers, including those re-entering the workforce, may prefer some flexibility in their work hours to meet their care-giving needs. Through the Work-Life Grant and Tripartite Standard (TS) on Flexible Work Arrangements (FWAs), the Government encourages employers to provide FWAs such as flexible start and end times or telecommuting to help employees better manage work and family responsibilities. As at end-September, around 1,900 employers, covering around 450,000 employees, have adopted the Tripartite Standard on FWAs. Jobseekers who require FWAs may find a better job fit with an employer that has adopted the TS on FWAs.Mothers looking for employment can also tap on Workforce Singapore (WSG)’s Adapt and Grow initiative, which offers a suite of employment services and programmes to help jobseekers to enter into new jobs. For more information, jobseekers can visit WSG’s Careers Connect and NTUC-e2i's career centres to find out more."
available support for young persons with acute mental health episode in a residential home,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Social and Family Development what support is available where a young person who stays in a residential home experiences an acute mental health episode that is beyond the residential home's capabilities but is not so serious as to meet a hospital's admission criteria.,"Mr Desmond Lee: Children and Young Persons (CYPs) may be referred by MSF or ordered by the Youth Court to reside in licensed Homes operated by social service agencies (SSAs). Such CYPs generally continue to attend school and participate in activities in the community. Where there are mental health concerns, these CYPs are supported by school counsellors and/or MSF psychologists, together with the care team of the Homes. There are also multidisciplinary Response, Early Intervention, Assessment in Community Mental Health teams to strengthen the ability of schools and SSAs to identify and support CYPs with mental health concerns and to make appropriate referrals. Where the mental health concerns are more severe, the CYPs may be referred to medical institutions such as the Child Guidance Clinic run by the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), where they may receive outpatient treatment, such as psychotherapy, or be admitted for inpatient treatment. Before the CYPs are discharged, caseworkers in the Homes engage the relevant medical professionals to formulate post-discharge care plans such as follow-up treatment and safety planning. MSF will continue to work closely with other Government agencies, SSAs, schools and the community to ensure that CYPs in residential Homes are appropriately supported for their mental well-being.  "
statistics of balance sums in medisave accounts returned to family members upon death of account holders in last five years,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Manpower (a) in each of the last five years, how many balance sums in MediSave accounts have been returned to the family members of the account holders upon their death, with and without nominations respectively; (b) how many balance sums are left unclaimed; and (c) what has been the average amount per deceased member for each of these unclaimed sums.","Mrs Josephine Teo: Over the past five years, close to 80% of unused CPF monies were distributed by CPF Board to beneficiaries according to deceased members’ nominations. The monies include balances in their Ordinary, MediSave, Special and Retirement Accounts. The unused monies of members who did not make nominations are transferred to the Public Trustee's Office (PTO) for distribution to the deceased’s next-of-kin in accordance with intestacy and Muslim inheritance laws. This was explained in MinLaw’s oral response on 4 November 2019 to Assoc Prof Daniel Goh. PTO reported that 88% of un-nominated CPF monies were distributed to next-of-kin in the last five years.In other words, about 98% of all unused CPF monies belonging to deceased members were eventually distributed by CPF Board and PTO in the last five years. Next-of-kin can approach PTO at any time to submit their claims on the unclaimed monies. There is no time limit for the application."
comparative study on carbon impact of tetra paks and disposable plastic bottles,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what respective percentages of (i) tetra paks and (ii) disposable plastic water bottles disposed of in a recycling bin in Singapore gets recycled; (b) whether the Ministry has conducted or knows of a life-cycle assessment that compares the carbon impact of a tetra pak to that of a disposable plastic water bottle of similar capacity; and (c) if so, what are the results of such studies.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Used beverage cartons, such as tetra pak cartons and disposable plastic water bottles, that have been deposited in the blue commingled recycling bins provided under the National Recycling Programme are sorted by the Public Waste Collectors at material recovery facilities. About 60% of all materials collected from the blue commingled recycling bins are recycled. NEA does not track the specific recycling percentages for disposable plastic water bottles or used tetra pak cartons.  We have not conducted any life-cycle assessment that specifically compares the carbon impact of a tetra pak carton with that of a disposable plastic water bottle of similar capacity; nor are we aware of any authoritative studies on this. NEA's focus is to reduce the excessive consumption of all types of packaging, not just plastic bottles or tetra pak cartons, and to work with stakeholders to promote recycling."
top three reasons employers deny employees access to childcare leave,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Manpower based on cases brought to the Ministry or Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) (a) what are the top three reasons that employers give for denying employees access to childcare leave; (b) how many cases have been brought to TAFEP in each of the past five years for denial of childcare leave; and (c) in how many of these cases have the employees obtained the childcare leave sought or employers changed their childcare leave policies following TAFEP's intervention.,"Mrs Josephine Teo:  The vast majority of employers and employees have been able to work out mutually agreeable arrangements for the taking of childcare leave. In the past five years, MOM and TAFEP did not receive any case where an employee had applied for childcare leave and the employer had unreasonably rejected the application. During this period, MOM handled 15 cases where childcare leave was either not provided or under-provided in an employee’s contract. The main reason for employers not having fulfilled their statutory obligations was a lack of awareness of employees’ entitlements. In all 15 cases, MOM required the employers to rectify their childcare leave policies to comply with the law, and took enforcement action against them."
safeguards to ensure singaporean youths are protected against vice activities peddled online,"Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what are the safeguards put in place to ensure that Singaporeans, especially youths, are protected against vice activities being peddled online in Internet forums; (b) whether there are efforts to educate the public on such activities and on reporting communication channels that promote vice activities to the authorities; and (c) whether there are measures to limit access to known sites that are peddling vice activities.","Mr K Shanmugam: The Government adopts a multi-pronged approach against online vice. The Police and the Infocomm Media Development Authority regularly block vice websites targeting Singaporeans, as and when they are discovered. To date, 202 such websites have been blocked. The Police also conduct regular enforcement operations to disrupt and deter vice activities, including those perpetuated through online platforms. For example, in November 2018, Police conducted a joint operation with China's Ministry of Public Security against a transnational online vice syndicate. This led to the arrest of 201 persons in Singapore and China and the shutting down of a website which advertised sexual services in Singapore. MHA takes a tough stance against vice, and in fact is proposing amendments to the Women's Charter this month to further strengthen our levers against online vice syndicates. The Police conduct extensive public communication efforts on vice activities and related arrests. Members of the public are encouraged to report any criminal or suspicious activities they see, such as the operation of online platforms that promote vice activities. They can call 1800-255-0000, submit the information via Police's i-Witness, or lodge a report in person at a Police station. More broadly, the Government has introduced a number of programmes to raise awareness of online harms and promote safe and responsible use of the Internet. For example, MOE's Cyber Wellness Education Programme educates students on appropriate online behavior. These lessons sensitise students to potential negative influences they may encounter online, and teach students how to protect themselves. MCI has also been putting in efforts to strengthen digital literacy among Singaporeans. It launched the Digital Media and Information Literacy Framework in July 2019 to develop in Singaporeans a fundamental appreciation of the risks and benefits of technology, and cultivate a basic understanding of how to use technology safely and responsibly.  The community and parents also play a critical role. We are glad to see organisations, such as the Media Literacy Council (MLC), engaging in outreach efforts on safer Internet use. MLC has provided information for youths and parents on how to deal with inappropriate online content, such as pornography and sexting, and produced resources to teach youths ways to safeguard themselves against sexual grooming and sexual predators.                   "
roll-out of 5g telecommunication services from 2020,"Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Communications and Information with regard to the impending roll-out of 5G telecommunication services from 2020 (a) what are the measures put in place to ensure that 5G equipment manufacturers have met security requirements; and (b) whether there are plans to speed up the rollout of islandwide 5G networks by implementing more smaller, millimetre airwave networks in tandem with the two islandwide networks.","Mr S Iswaran: Our vision is for Singapore to be a global front-runner for innovation in secure 5G applications and services. On 17 October 2019, IMDA announced its decision to allocate 5G spectrum via a Call for Proposal (CFP). A key criterion is for applicants to demonstrate how their proposed 5G networks will be resilient and secure by design. This includes meeting key resilience and security requirements stipulated by IMDA and subjecting their 5G equipment to independent security testing in accordance with international standards. Under the CFP process, IMDA will facilitate the deployment of two nationwide 5G networks, which will provide 5G coverage to at least half of Singapore by end-2022. To complement this, IMDA is also allocating millimetre wave spectrum for the deployment of two additional localised 5G networks to compete for early business use cases and trial new service innovations. This will allow consumers and businesses to benefit from 5G from as early as mid-2021.                                                     "
statistics on injuries treated at public hospitals resulting from pmd accidents,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Transport (a) since 2018, how many persons have been treated at accident and emergency departments of public hospitals for injuries resulting from PMD accidents, broken down by (i) riders (ii) pedestrians and (iii) the severity of injuries sustained; and (b) how does this accident and injury rate compare with (i) international experience with PMDs and (ii) other forms of transport in Singapore such as bicycling, motorcycles, cars and public transport.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Based on data from the National Trauma Registry, 299 people were treated at hospitals for personal mobility device-related incidents in 2018. These included 259 riders and eight pedestrians. About 63% of the injuries were classified as minor, 21% moderate and 16% severe. In the same time period, 1,836 people were treated at hospitals for injuries from bicycle-related incidents, 5,700 for motorcycle-related incidents, and 6,743 for car-related incidents. Across all these categories, about 89% of the injuries were minor, 7% moderate and 4% severe. We are unable to make an international comparison of PMD-related injuries due to a lack of such published data."
capacity and utilisation rates of long-term care services,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the current capacity and utilisation rates of long-term care services such as nursing homes, centre-based care and home-based care, broken down by type of service as classified by the Agency for Integrated Care; (b) whether these utilisation rates indicate unmet demand or under-utilisation; and (c) if so, what are the reasons for such unmet demand or under-utilisation.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: The capacity of long term care services as at June 2019 was approximately 15,800 nursing home beds, 7,100 day care places, 9,500 home care places, and 6,100 home palliative care places. The utilisation rates were about 85%, 52%, 54%, and 45% respectively. These included all subsidised clients and private clients who were reported by providers.The utilisation rates across the services show that there is sufficient long-term care capacity nationally. We have expanded capacity over the years to ensure that the care needs of an ageing population across different settings are met.  We monitor capacity and take-up rate regularly and adjust our development plan accordingly to respond to changing care needs. "
role of gurkha contingent of singapore police force,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether there have been changes to the role of the Gurkha Contingent (GC) of the Singapore Police Force since its establishment and, if so, what are these changes; and (b) whether there is more that the GC can do for our national security.","Mr K Shanmugam: The role of the Gurkha Contingent has remained unchanged. It is tasked with guarding selected installations, providing security coverage at major security events, and augmenting Police response to public order and public security incidents."
proportion of kindergartens operated by private providers and autonomous operators offering before and after-school care,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what is the proportion of kindergartens operated by private providers and autonomous operators offering before and after-school care; and (b) whether there are any regulatory impediments for private kindergarten operators offering before and after-school care programmes.,"Mr Desmond Lee: Under the Early Childhood Development Centres Act, kindergartens are licensed to provide half-day education programmes of six hours or less per session. As the provision requirements for kindergartens are for half-day education services only, kindergartens cannot provide care services for pre-school-aged children. Nevertheless, centres that wish to provide such before or after preschool care services can do so if they are licensed as childcare centres instead.Subject to the Early Childhood Development Agency’s (ECDA) approval, pre-schools may provide before and after school care (BASC) services during their operating hours for older children aged seven to below 14 years. This is mainly to cater to working parents who require after-school care support for their Primary-school going children, including those who may have siblings attending the pre-school where the BASC services are provided. The BASC programme must be run in a separate space from the preschool programme, and centres can enrol children only up to 10% of the centre’s accommodation capacity. The centre must adhere to stipulated safety, health, hygiene and supervision standards, to ensure the well-being of the children. To date, ECDA has not received any applications from kindergartens to run BASC services during their operating hours.Kindergarten operators may also offer BASC services for older children after the kindergarten's operating hours or outside the kindergarten premises. There are currently three private kindergarten operators which provide such services and are registered with MSF to also administer the Student Care Fee Assistance Scheme. Such registered student care centres are required to meet stipulated standards in areas of supervision, physical environment, operating hours, safety, health and hygiene, and provide a structured daily programme.           "
bursaries and scholarships awarded by autonomous universities in past five years,Mr Ang Wei Neng asked the Minister for Education (a) how many bursaries and scholarships (number and quantum) have been awarded by the respective Autonomous Universities (AU) in the past five years using (i) the endowment fund and/or reserve and (ii) Government funding; and (b) what are the criteria of awarding such bursaries and scholarships.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: In Academic Year (AY) 2018, more than 34,000 bursaries and/or scholarships were awarded to full-time Singaporean undergraduate students at the Autonomous Universities (AUs). This has increased significantly from AY2014, when around 21,000 were awarded. Please see Table 1 below.  In FY2018, the Government spent a total of $65 million on bursaries. As announced at the National Day Rally in August 2019, the Government will further enhance bursaries to cover up to 75% of subsidised tuition fees from AY2020 onwards. Government bursaries provide financial support for Singaporean full-time undergraduate students from lower and middle income families with gross monthly household income up to $9,000 or gross monthly household per capita income up to $2,250. Apart from Government bursaries, the AUs also provide their own financial aid and scholarships, which are funded through AUs' endowment fund returns and reserves. As these are administered by the AUs, the eligibility criteria may also vary. These could include students' family financial circumstances, academic merit, and/or co-curricular performance. The quanta vary, as the award may range from one-off awards to full scholarships. The sizes of AUs' endowment funds are available in their annual reports. In FY2018, the AUs spent $23 million on bursaries alone for Singaporean undergraduates."
"plans to promote collaborative, kind and compassionate working relationship between employers and foreign domestic workers","Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Manpower what is being done to promote a collaborative, kind and compassionate working relationship between employers and foreign domestic workers.","Mrs Josephine Teo: A healthy and strong working relationship requires the cooperation and effort of both employers and foreign domestic workers (FDWs). An important first step towards this is improving the chances of employers being matched with FDWs who can suitably meet their household needs.With this aim in mind, MOM recently announced that from October 2020, employers and employment agencies (EAs) will be provided with more information on the past work experience of prospective FDWs to help improve matching outcomes. This would include the FDW's previous job scope, the residence type and household size of the FDW's former employer, as well as the FDW's reason for leaving her past employments.Besides these efforts, MOM regularly reaches out to employers and FDWs through electronic direct mailers and newsletters that often feature best practices and tips on how to develop good working relationships through mutual understanding and support. For first-time employers and FDWs, entering into a new work arrangement entails substantial adjustment. This is why MOM requires all first-time employers of FDWs to attend the Employers' Orientation Programme (EOP), which helps them understand their roles and responsibilities as employers. The EOP emphasises the importance of developing a good employer-FDW relationship and reminds employers to be understanding and patient when guiding FDWs on their household chores and integrating them with the family. Similarly, first-time FDWs have to attend the Settling-In-Programme (SIP), which introduces them to the social norms in Singapore and teaches them how to maintain open communication with their employers.   There are also many on-going efforts by employment agencies (EAs) and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to promote a positive working relationship between employers and FDWs. The Association of Employment Agencies Singapore (AEA(S)) gives out awards to honour and recognise FDWs and employers who have maintained healthy long-lasting relationships. NGOs like the Centre for Domestic Employees (CDE) and the Foreign Domestic Worker Association for Social Support and Training (FAST) also organise fun and social activities to encourage bonding between FDWs and their employers. CDE and FAST now also offer dispute resolution services to help employers and FDWs work out their disagreements. Many of our employers do make the effort to ensure that their FDWs are adjusting well. An FDW survey conducted in 2015 showed that the vast majority (97%) of FDWs were satisfied with working in Singapore. MOM will continue to work with EAs and NGOs to promote a healthy working relationship between employers and FDWs. "
amount of subsidies given to anchor operators of childcare centres and kindergarten in past five years,"Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for Social and Family Development for the past five years (a) what is the amount of subsidies, including renovation costs, given to anchor operators of childcare centres and kindergartens; and (b) who are the top three anchor operator grant recipients and how much subsidies did each of them receive in the same period.","Mr Desmond Lee: The Government is committed to enhancing access to affordable and quality pre-schools. To achieve this, the Government funds operators through the Anchor Operator and Partner Operator schemes, and runs MOE Kindergartens. The Anchor Operator scheme was introduced in 2009. Government grants are provided to Anchor Operators in return for them adhering to fee caps1 for the pre-school places they provide, plus significant demands on efforts to improve quality and invest in teacher development. In addition, Anchor Operators offer Malay and Tamil language instruction, and support enrolment of children from low-income families. There are currently five Anchor Operators. As at end 2018, the Anchor Operators operated about 570 centres and enrolled 60,300 Singapore Citizen children.As the size of Anchor Operators varies substantially, it is more meaningful to look at the amount of Government grants provided for each child. For 2018, the Government provided about $6,000 of grants (on average) for each Singapore Citizen child enrolled in Anchor Operator centres. The highest grant per child was provided for children in MY World Preschool, E-Bridge Preschool, and Skool4Kidz."
update on introduction of pilot advance placement scheme for foreign domestic workers,Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Manpower since the introduction of the pilot Advance Placement Scheme (APS) (a) how many foreign domestic workers (FDWs) are brought in annually under the scheme; (b) what happens to these FDWs who are not subsequently employed; (c) whether employment agencies participating in APS are monitored in how they match employers with eldercare needs to FDWs and whether these FDWs are trained in eldercare specifically; and (d) whether there are plans to review the scheme.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: In 2016, MOM introduced the Advance Placement Scheme (APS) to reduce the time taken for households with urgent caregiving needs, such as eldercare and/or childcare, to hire foreign domestic workers (FDWs). There are currently 32 employment agencies (EAs) on the APS. The EAs on the APS are carefully selected based on their track record and training plans for their FDWs. In addition, MOM also monitors carefully the number of FDWs placed successfully by the EAs through the APS. On average, about 3,000 prospective FDWs were brought in under the APS each year. The vast majority (90%) of them were successfully matched with employers. For the remaining 10%, the EAs will make arrangements to send them home. There is another scheme, the Eldercarer FDW Scheme administered by the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC), which specifically helps households that require FDWs trained in eldercare. There are currently 55 EAs under the Scheme. Households that require faster deployment of their FDWs can also select EAs participating in the APS. There are 15 EAs that are on both the APS and the Eldercarer FDW Scheme. Since the introduction of the APS, MOM has progressively expanded the number of participating APS EAs to meet the demand from households. MOM will review the APS regularly to ensure its effectiveness. "
update on plans for primary schools in buangkok,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar asked the Minister for Education whether he can provide an update on plans to build and operate a Primary school on the parcel of land gazetted for a Primary school in Buangkok housing estate in light of there being 22 new blocks of flats and four new pre-school centres in the estate and the demand for Primary school places being likely to increase for this estate.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: MOE's school planning takes into account housing development programmes and projected population in the residential area, to ensure that there are sufficient school places to meet the demand of families with school-going children. For the Buangkok housing estate, MOE is aware of the recently completed and impending new housing developments. There are currently six Primary schools within 1 km and another 10 Primary schools within 2 km of the Buangkok housing estate. The 16 schools have sufficient capacity to meet the projected demand from residents. Specifically, at the end of Phase 2C of the recent Primary 1 registration exercises, there were about 270 vacancies in the schools within 1 km and another 315 vacancies in the schools within 2 km of the Buangkok estate. MOE will continue to monitor the demand and supply situation of the Primary schools in this area closely. We will also make the necessary adjustments to meet the demand for school places in the area. If required, we can consider opening more school places in some of the existing schools near Buangkok estate."
online versions of syllabus on schools' websites for access by parents,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Education (a) whether online versions of schools' syllabus can be put up on schools' websites so that parents can access and help guide their children where necessary; and (b) whether the Ministry can conduct guidance workshops for parents who are keen to help their children with their school work.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: Online versions of the syllabus for school subjects are already accessible from MOE's website. Similarly, schools share their key learning programmes and activities on their school websites and through briefings to parents.  These efforts help parents to understand what their children are learning in school and appreciate how schools have implemented the national curriculum to engage their children in holistic education.We encourage parents to support their children in learning by helping them to discover their interests and strengths, and provide a home environment that encourages children to develop self-management skills, take ownership of their learning and grow holistically. "
filing of complaints with tripartite alliance for fair and progressive employment practices for denial of access to childcare leave,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Manpower under what circumstances can an employee file a case with the Ministry or the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) for being denied access to childcare leave.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: Childcare leave is a statutory entitlement. While childcare leave requests are subject to employers’ approval, employers should grant them unless they have good reasons for not doing so. Any employee who thinks that he or she has been unreasonably denied childcare leave should report the employer to MOM. Over the last five years, MOM has not received any case where an employee had applied for childcare leave and the employer had unreasonably rejected the application. If a report is filed, MOM will look at the specific circumstances of each case and determine if childcare leave has been unreasonably withheld."
uptake of government-paid child care leave scheme by working parents in past five years,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Social and Family Development for each year in the past five years under the Government-Paid Child Care Leave (GPCL) Scheme (a) what is the number and percentage of working mothers with (i) one child (ii) two children or (iii) more than two children who have taken six days of childcare leave respectively; and (b) what is the number and percentage of working fathers with (i) one child (ii) two children or (iii) more than two children who took six days of childcare leave respectively.,"Mr Desmond Lee: Currently, when employers submit claims for Government-Paid Child Care Leave (GPCL), we only check whether the employee has a child below seven years old. We do not request information on the number of children the employee has. As such, the information requested is not readily available."
plans for singapore to reach net zero emissions,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Prime Minister following the SG Climate Rally where our youths called for peak emissions by 2020, halved emissions by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2050, whether the Government is (i) including carbon emission reductions and economic decarbonisation targets in its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to be updated by 2020; (ii) enhancing our upcoming NDC to reflect its highest possible ambition; (iii) declaring a climate emergency to highlight the severity of the climate crisis and (iv) setting a timeline for Singapore to reach net zero emissions.","Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): Singapore recognises that climate change is a global and national existential issue and there is urgency for all countries to take climate action. Singapore’s Emissions Intensity (EI), that is, greenhouse gas emissions per dollar of GDP, is currently one of the lowest in the world. This is the result of choosing environmentally responsible policies as we developed, for example our vehicle control and use measures; and converting almost completely to the use of natural gas for electricity generation instead of fuel oil since the early 2000s. In comparison, many developed and developing countries are still using significant amounts of coal for electricity generation, and motor-vehicle fuel is still subsidised in several countries in our region. We are continuing to do our part to address greenhouse gas emissions. We have pledged in our Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) that by 2030, we will further reduce our EI by 36% from 2005 levels. We also aim to peak our emissions at 65 million tonne of CO2 equivalent around 2030. This commitment was made after carefully assessing our circumstances, and what we are able to do. Singapore's NDC is ambitious, given our circumstances. We are a small, highly urbanised city-state, and our small land area, lack of great rivers and low and variable wind speeds limit our ability to deploy nuclear and renewable energy sources such as hydro, wind and solar energy. Nonetheless, we seek to push the bounds of innovation such as deploying floating solar photovoltaic systems on our reservoirs and offshore to make up for shortage of land area to deploy them. Such innovations have given us confidence to raise our level of ambition, to double our solar deployment target from 1 Gigawatt peak (GWp) beyond 2020 to at least 2 GWp by 2030. At this level, solar power will be able to meet around 4% of our current annual electricity needs.  Achieving our NDC will require significant whole-of-nation effort. We constantly encourage businesses and individuals to be more energy efficient. We amended the Energy Conservation Act in 2017 to require large industrial emitters to implement good energy management practices. Our policies aim to help our industries, such as petro-chemicals and electronics, be among the best-in-class globally so that we can be a responsible supplier of such products. This year, we implemented an enhanced set of Industry Energy Efficiency schemes. The Government is also making major investments to enhance public transport and active mobility infrastructure so that, by 2040, nine in 10 of all peak period journeys will be made on ""walk, cycle and ride"" transport modes, where ""ride"" refers to public and shared transport. We were the first to implement an economy-wide carbon tax in our region and did so without exemptions.  We are studying how further advances in technology can help Singapore transit earlier to a lower carbon future, and exploring the feasibility of working towards net zero emissions. For example, the Government has commissioned studies to evaluate the opportunities and challenges of carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS), and ""green"" hydrogen, and recommend next steps for Singapore. We will also work with industry and our research community to explore pilot projects and implement research and development initiatives to improve their feasibility, and to develop the necessary frameworks to support adoption when these solutions become economically viable.Climate change is a global issue that requires a global response, and we are committed to work with the international community to address this urgent challenge. For Singapore to do our full part, the Government cannot do it alone. We are heartened that Singaporeans, especially our youth, care deeply about this issue. A recent survey by the National Climate Change Secretariat also showed that most Singaporeans understand the importance of the issue and are prepared to take climate-friendly actions in their daily lives to address the issue. Saving electricity, using public transport and reducing waste are practical ways for Singaporeans to cut carbon emissions. We will continue to work closely with businesses, the community and individuals to do more to tackle climate change together."
progress of discussion with malaysia on cross-country mrt line,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Transport what is the latest progress of the discussion with Malaysia on the cross-country MRT line and how soon can it be completed.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: On 21 May 2019, Singapore and Malaysia signed a Supplemental Agreement to suspend the construction of the Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System (RTS) Link Project up to 30 September 2019. Malaysia had requested the suspension, to give them time to study ways to reduce the project cost. While the RTS Link Bilateral Agreement makes no provision for a suspension, in the spirit of bilateral cooperation, Singapore agreed to Malaysia's request. On 20 September 2019, Singapore received Malaysia’s request for an extension of the suspension period to 31 October 2019. Singapore agreed to Malaysia's request. On 21 October 2019, Malaysia conveyed to Singapore that they intend to proceed with the RTS Link Project with some changes. Malaysia was however not yet ready to share the details of their proposed changes with Singapore. Without the details, Malaysia's proposal is incomplete and Singapore is unable to make a thorough assessment of the technical and commercial feasibility of the proposal. On 29 October 2019, Malaysia requested a further extension of the suspension period by six months to 30 April 2020. In the spirit of bilateral cooperation, Singapore agreed to Malaysia’s request to further extend the suspension period.  Singapore welcomes Malaysia's decision to proceed with the RTS Link Project. This is a mutually beneficial Project for both countries. The RTS Link will significantly ease Causeway congestion, facilitate business and tourism, and bring our people closer together. While we are not obliged to accept Malaysia's proposed changes, we will continue to keep an open mind and assess them carefully and objectively. Both sides are currently discussing the changes to the Project, which will require amendments to the RTS Link Bilateral Agreement. Apart from the re-stated Bilateral Agreement, two other agreements will need to be signed at the same time by the end of the suspension period. They are the Joint Venture Agreement between Singapore's SMRT Corporation and Malaysia's Prasarana Malaysia Berhad to constitute a joint venture Operating Company or ""OpCo"", and a Concession Agreement for the Singapore and Malaysian Governments to appoint this OpCo as the RTS Link operator. The discussions will take some time, and both sides are working hard on this.  "
requirement for temasek and gic to observe policy of rotating engagement partners of their external auditors,Mr Leon Perera asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance whether Temasek and GIC observe a policy of rotating the engagement partners of their external auditors after a certain number of years.,"Mr Heng Swee Keat: Temasek is an investment holding company and owns the assets it manages. It is audited by commercial auditors, and has in place a policy of rotating its audit engagement partners every five years. This is similar to the requirement imposed by SGX on listed companies to rotate the audit partner after five consecutive audits. GIC manages the Government's assets. Hence, it is audited by the Auditor-General, who is appointed by the President and serves as an independent Organ of State under the Constitution to audit the entities managing public funds."
statistics on pmd riders caught for speeding on footpaths and reported accidents between pmd users and pedestrians,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the number of PMD riders caught for speeding on footpaths since the speed limit was lowered to 10 km/h in February 2019; (b) what is the number of reported accidents between PMD users and pedestrians since this change; and (c) what other measures is LTA taking to mitigate such accidents.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: We reduced the speed limit on footpaths from 15 km/h to 10 km/h on 1 February 2019. Between 1 February and 30 September 2019, LTA caught 55 personal mobility device (PMD) riders for speeding on footpaths. Over the same period, there were about 90 reported accidents between PMD riders and pedestrians on footpaths.To restore safety on footpaths for pedestrians, we have decided to prohibit e-scooter usage on footpaths from 5 November 2019."
tracking of delivery riders using pmds to carry out their delivery,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the Government keeps track of the number of delivery riders for food or other delivery companies who are currently using PMDs to carry out their delivery work and, if so, what is the current number of such riders; and (b) if it does not, whether the Government intends to start keeping track of the number of such riders.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: As food delivery riders can work for more than one company, we do not track their number. We understand from the major food delivery companies that their deliveries are largely done by motorcycles and delivery vehicles. Less than 30% of Deliveroo and FoodPanda's riders use e-scooters."
assisting retiring scdf officers to transit into civil emergencies or fire safety-related industries,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) how is the Ministry helping retiring SCDF officers to transit into civil emergencies or fire safety-related industries; (b) how many officers has the Ministry supported in post-retirement career support; and (c) how will the Ministry strengthen its career transition preparation and support.,"Mr K Shanmugam: SCDF has worked with SkillsFuture Singapore to accredit selected modules of SCDF's fire-fighting and emergency medical training programmes under the national Workforce Skills Qualifications framework. The competencies acquired by SCDF officers will thus be recognised by prospective employers and improve our officers' employability when they retire from SCDF. MHA has also introduced a number of initiatives to help retiring SCDF and other Home Team officers prepare for a second career. We provide time-off for them to attend courses to learn new skills, and subsidise the cost of their courses. For example, officers may apply to pursue a Fire Safety Manager (FSM) qualification programme, which will enable them to take up jobs as FSMs for commercial and industrial buildings after retirement.  We actively engage prospective employers to source for suitable job opportunities for our retiring officers. We organise regular networking sessions where our officers can interact with prospective employers. We also facilitate officers' career transition by enabling them to take up a job attachment in a company prior to their retirement to try out the job. This will help both the officer and the prospective employer assess the fit before formal employment.We provide career transition support to all our retiring officers. Over the last two years, more than 200 retiring SCDF officers have participated in these career transition programmes. MHA has recently launched a new career transition resources portal to provide retiring and retired officers with useful information on different job industries, job opportunities, as well as career events and workshops. MHA also offers one-on-one career coaching sessions to our retiring officers to guide them on their career transition journey."
deterrent measures to ensure integrated resorts do not repeat same offences,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Home Affairs in respect of the big increase in the fines imposed on Resorts World Sentosa and Marina Bay Sands last year (a) what measures have been or will be taken to ensure that the Integrated Resorts do not repeat the same offences in future; and (b) whether current punishments for the offences reported are sufficient to deter future occurrences.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The increase was mainly due to lapses by Resorts World Sentosa (RWS) in performing required customer due diligence (CDD) checks; this accounted for $650,000 of the total increase from the year before. There was also an increase of $35,000 in financial penalties imposed for social safeguard breaches by both Marina Bay Sands (MBS) and RWS.On the lapses relating to CDD, RWS had processed some transactions when the required checks on the patrons were incomplete, and had failed to verify the identities of certain patrons. The casinos handle a lot of cash, and are thus susceptible to risks of money laundering and terrorism financing. CDD requirements are important measures to mitigate this risk. On the lapses relating to social safeguards, RWS had allowed five minors and MBS had allowed one, to enter the casinos. MBS had also allowed a Permanent Resident to enter without payment of entry levy. Both operators have enhanced their processes, which include system enhancements to automate checks and the conduct of refresher training for casino employees.CRA has been giving guidance to the operators on putting in place measures to prevent and detect lapses. CRA also conducts unannounced spot checks and inspections.Mr Tan also asks whether the current punishments are sufficient to deter future occurrences. CRA will continue to monitor the situation. The law provides for stiff penalties. However, the Member will appreciate, that the stiff penalties exist, is no guarantee in itself, that there will be no breaches of the law.  "
peak and off-peak waiting and clearance times at singapore-malaysia land checkpoints,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what are the peak and off-peak waiting and clearance times at Singapore-Malaysia land checkpoints; and (b) whether the Ministry can publish data on daily and hourly average traffic volumes, waiting times and clearance times to improve accountability and allow commuters and businesses to plan ahead.","Mr K Shanmugam: The Woodlands and Tuas land checkpoints are among the busiest in the world. Every day, around 400,000 travellers cross them. Weekday traffic is usually highest from 5 am to 10 am and 5 pm to 9 pm. The waiting time at the Singapore checkpoints can go up to 1.5 hours during peak periods, and 30 minutes during non-peak periods. This does not include the time needed to clear immigration in Malaysia.The waiting time increases significantly during school holidays, festive periods and long weekends, and could go beyond two hours.Other unpredictable factors also affect the waiting time. These include traffic accidents, vehicle breakdowns, security incidents and traffic tailbacks from Johor. ICA provides real-time checkpoint traffic updates via local radio stations, social media platforms, and LTA's Expressway Monitoring Advisory System signage. Travellers can also check the checkpoint traffic conditions via live CCTVs on LTA's OneMotoring website, or via commercial navigation apps that provide estimated travel times. These real-time updates, and the broad traffic trends I had mentioned earlier, should help travellers plan their journey. It may not be useful or meaningful to compile and publish data on an hourly and daily basis."
use of medisave savings for mental health therapy and counselling treatment at public hospitals,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Health whether patients can be allowed to use their MediSave savings for mental health therapy and counselling treatment at public hospitals.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Mental health therapy and counselling treatment are typically provided in the outpatient setting. Subsidies are available for patients receiving these treatments in public healthcare institutions. Under the Chronic Disease Management Programme, patients with mental health conditions such as schizophrenia, major depression, bipolar disorder and anxiety can also withdraw up to $500 from MediSave per year to defray the cost of these outpatient treatments. In addition, patients aged 60 and above may withdraw another $200 per year under the Flexi-MediSave scheme.  Where a patient's mental health condition leads to an inpatient stay in a public hospital, he or she can receive subsidies and MediShield Life coverage for his or her hospitalisation bill. MediSave can also be used to cover the inpatient stay.Singaporeans who face difficulties with their medical bills at public hospitals after Government subsidies, MediShield Life and MediSave may approach medical social workers at public healthcare institutions for additional financial assistance. No Singaporean will be denied access to necessary and appropriate healthcare because of an inability to pay.   "
more flexibility in use of medisave for maintenance rehabilitation,Mr Christopher de Souza asked Minister for Health whether the Ministry will increase flexibility in the use of MediSave for maintenance rehabilitation especially for stroke patients who need long-term maintenance to keep their physical condition up.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: MediSave is primarily designed to help Singaporeans put aside sufficient savings for their hospitalisation expenses, particularly in old age. In considering any further expansion, it is important to ensure that Singaporeans have enough MediSave for such purposes. Today, MediSave is allowed for active rehabilitation, which helps patients recover their functional status, including those who are recovering from stroke. From mid-2020, severely disabled patients aged 30 and above can withdraw up to $200 per month in cash from their own and/or their spouse's MediSave accounts to support their care needs, which can be used for maintenance exercise.There are also other forms of support available to patients. Patients receive subsidies of up to 80% for non-residential long-term care services, including maintenance exercise. Those who require further financial assistance can approach medical social workers for assistance."
details on inflation rate for dental services without government subsidies,"Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked the Minister for Health with regard to the 2.1% inflation rate for dental services after Government subsidies over the past 10 years (a) whether the Ministry is able to provide the inflation rate without Government subsidies; (b) whether the Ministry has the figures for the inflation rate for private sector dental services; and (c) whether these figures take into account the costs for dental implants, dental prosthetics like dentures and also specialised procedures like root canal operations.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Healthcare inflation measures the growth in actual prices of healthcare related goods and services, inclusive of taxes and after Government subsidies. It is calculated based on the Healthcare Consumer Price Index (CPI) compiled by the Singapore Department of Statistics (DOS). We currently do not have specific data on inflation for dental services without Government subsidies. Between 2009 and 2018, the inflation rate for dental services provided by the private sector was 2.3% per annum.These inflation figures reflect the price changes for dental procedures commonly used by Singaporeans, such as scaling and polishing, filling, dental prosthetics (dentures) fitting, root canal treatment and so on. Dental implants are currently not included in the CPI basket as they are less frequently used."
effectiveness of police’s polcam 2.0 in preventing and solving crimes in heartlands,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) how effective has the Police's camera system PolCam 2.0 been in preventing and solving crimes in the heartlands; (b) how will the system be enhanced in the future; and (c) what are the costs for maintaining and upgrading the system.,"Mr K Shanmugam: As of September 2019, Police have installed about 11,000 cameras under PolCam 2.0 in town centres, neighbourhood centres, hawker centres and linkways leading to transportation nodes such as MRT stations and bus interchanges. Police will continue to install cameras in more public areas based on our operational needs to enhance public security and to prevent and detect crime.The tender for the PolCam 2.0 project was awarded at a budget of $45 million, including maintenance costs.These cameras have helped Police deter and solve crimes, such as unlicensed moneylending, robbery and theft, and outrage of modesty. As of September 2019, more than 3,400 cases had been solved with the help of video footage from Police cameras. The Police will continue to leverage technology as a key strategy to ensure a safe and secure home for Singaporeans."
statistics on mid-career professionals joining nursing profession through healthcare professional conversion programme,"Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Health (a) in the past three years, how many mid-career professionals have joined the nursing profession through the Healthcare Professional Conversion Programme (PCP); (b) which industries do these mid-career nurses come from; and (c) whether there can be an accelerated Nursing PCP for informal care-givers who have to leave their jobs due to family circumstances and are now looking to return to the workforce.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Professional Conversion Programmes (PCPs) in nursing support mid-career Singaporeans who wish to enter the nursing profession. In the last three years, close to 300 locals underwent such programmes. About 40% of them were from non-nursing professions in the health and social services sectors. The other 60% come from a wide range of industries, such as manufacturing, finance and public administration. The PCPs for Registered Nurses at the Diploma and Degree level are accelerated programmes that allow mid-career individuals to complete their training in two years, compared to fresh school leavers who would take three years to do so. "
statistics on infants and toddlers not secured in child seats and injured in motor accidents in past 10 years,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Home Affairs for each year in the past 10 years, what is number and percentage of infants and toddlers injured in motor accidents who were not secured in child seats.","Mr K Shanmugam: Traffic Police does not have the breakdown of data for the past 10 years. For 2017 and 2018, an average of 53 infants and toddlers of age three years and below each year were injured in accidents while in motor vehicles. Twenty-seven percent of the infants and toddlers were in taxis or public buses, for which the use of child seats is not required. Fifteen percent of them were not in child seats. Seven percent of them were in child seats. For the remaining 51%, Traffic Police's records did not track whether they were in child seats. "
falling water level at johor's linggiu reservoir,"Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources in light of the water level at Johor's Linggiu Reservoir falling below 50% due to the on-going dry weather, what plans does the Ministry have to work with Malaysia to increase the yield of the Johor River, which has its water flow regulated by the Linggiu Reservoir, to ensure a sustainable water supply for both countries.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The water level at Linggiu Reservoir has fallen from 72% at the start of 2019 to below 50% in September 2019. While the water level has since risen slightly to above 50% in October 2019, Linggiu Reservoir has been slow to recover because more water is being drawn from the Johor River than is sustainable. This is exacerbated during dry weather, as PUB needs to discharge more water from Linggiu Reservoir to support water abstractions from the Johor River by both Malaysia and Singapore. Malaysia has built water plants upstream of the Johor River Waterworks (JRWW), which have increased the abstraction of water from the Johor River beyond what is sustainable. Singapore built the Linggiu Reservoir at a cost of more than $300 million to enable reliable abstraction of water at PUB's JRWW. If the Linggiu Reservoir fails, the Johor River flows during dry periods will not be sufficient to meet the abstractions of Johor's water treatment plants and Singapore’s JRWW. Singapore's right to abstract our full entitlement of 250 million gallons of water per day under the 1962 Water Agreement will then be compromised.As mentioned by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the 9th Singapore-Malaysia Leaders' Retreat in April 2019, Singapore and Malaysia have an interest to work together to ensure a sustainable water supply for both sides. MEWR and PUB have been engaging our Malaysian counterparts at both the federal and state levels through regular meetings and exchanges. Both sides have noted Singapore and Malaysia’s mutual interest in identifying appropriate and timely measures, including additional schemes, to increase the yield of the Johor River. Singapore and Malaysia have long-standing cooperation on water issues and Singapore will continue to work with Malaysia to achieve mutually-beneficial outcomes and ensure a sustainable water supply for both countries. "
long-term measures to curb amount of packaging used in delivery of online purchases,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources what long-term measures will be introduced to curb the extensive amount of packaging used in delivery of online purchases.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Packaging waste is a priority waste stream identified in Singapore's Zero Waste Masterplan. We are putting in place a regulatory framework to reduce, reuse and recycle packaging under the Resource Sustainability Act. Next year, we will implement mandatory reporting of packaging data and plans to reduce, reuse or recycle packaging. This includes packaging used in the delivery of online purchases. This reporting will focus companies' attention on the packaging that they are placing on the market and increase their awareness of the potential for reducing packaging use in their operations. The requirements will apply to manufacturers and importers of packaged goods, as well as supermarkets with an annual turnover of more than $10 million. This includes Singapore-registered e-commerce companies that are also manufacturers and importers of packaged goods, as well as online supermarkets. However, it is difficult to impose our regulations on overseas e-commerce companies. This is a challenge faced around the world. We will closely monitor developments in this area and consult the local industry on ways to bring these companies on board.   The reporting framework will lay the foundation for an Extended Producer Responsibility framework to manage packaging waste including plastics, which will be put in place no later than 2025 or even earlier. We will also complement the regulatory framework with measures such as educational campaigns and co-creation of solutions. We will convene a Citizens' Workgroup next year to discuss and identify the way forward for us to collectively address excessive consumption of single-use plastics in Singapore. My Ministry will continue to work closely with all stakeholders to reduce the consumption of packaging waste."
tracking of over-prescription of medicine and guidelines for prescription quantities,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the Ministry is keeping track of over-prescription of medicine in terms of quantity that can lead to cost inflation and wastage; and (b) whether the Ministry is providing guidelines for prescription quantities.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: While the Ministry does not specifically track over-prescription of medication, there are measures in place to minimise excessive provision of medication.  Depending on a patient's condition, doctors generally prescribe a supply of medication till the patient’s next appointment date. The supply of medication is normally set at no more than three months for normal medication and no more than six months for more stable chronic illnesses. For newly prescribed medications, public healthcare institutions encourage patients to collect a shorter duration of medication to prevent wastage, as the medication may be unsuitable. Public healthcare hospitals also carry out medication reconciliation prior to a patient's discharge. This is a process of creating a consolidated list of all medications a patient is taking and reconciling them where appropriate. It helps to reduce potential adverse effects arising from medication interactions and reduce unnecessary drugs. Dispensing pharmacists also review the patient's medication to eliminate unnecessary or excessive supply of medication.Beyond the public healthcare institutions, the Pharmaceutical Society of Singapore also holds regular public education events to encourage patients not to over collect medications. "
plans for population of pulau ubin,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for National Development (a) what are the Ministry's five- and 10-year plans for the population of Pulau Ubin; (b) what is the population by age and gender of Pulau Ubin since 2014; (c) what criteria are used for this calculation; and (d) what are the measures in place to meet their healthcare, social and emotional needs, and by whom.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Our current plans are to keep Pulau Ubin a natural getaway for Singaporeans to enjoy. There are now about 130 people residing or working on the island.NParks works closely with the Friends of Ubin Network (FUN), a group of diverse stakeholders, to ensure the well-being of the residents in Pulau Ubin. NParks has also set up a dedicated Community Liaison Team to address the needs of the community there. The team gathers feedback from the community and coordinates the sensitive improvement of facilities and services to meet household needs. For example, the team conducts safety inspections and house repairs, drainage and track improvements, provides rubbish disposal services and goes door-to-door to distribute potable water during droughts. The team also coordinates with agencies, community partners and the grassroots to provide resources and programmes for the welfare of Ubin's residents. Collectively, these efforts aim to preserve Ubin's cultural heritage and way of life."
review of existing uniform development charge and differentiated charges for hotel operators and backpacker hostel operators,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry will review the existing uniform development charge and differentiated charges for hotel operators and backpacker hostel operators as both cater to different types of tourists and backpacker hostel operators provide basic common and shared facilities, to ensure a more level playing field for the industry.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Development Charge (DC) is a tax payable on any enhancement in land value arising from URA granting planning permission for a development application. The DC system allows the state to channel the gains from the enhancement in land value to offset the costs of developing public infrastructure, for example, roads and utilities.  DC rates are broken down in nine broad use groups and 118 geographical sectors. Hotels and backpackers' hostels are under the same broad use group, as they both provide short-term accommodation and are allowed on sites zoned ""Hotel"" under the Master Plan.  However, land owners and developers who think that the prevailing DC rate overstates the value of their land can request for a spot valuation. In such an instance, the Chief Valuer will then look at the specific proposed use of the land and determine the valuation based on that specific use."
review of operation of reinstatement clauses for hdb commercial leases,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for National Development whether the Government will review the operation of reinstatement clauses for HDB commercial leases with a view to (i) requiring some cost sharing for reinstatement between outbound and inbound tenants and (ii) requiring reinstatement to be done only when there is an inbound tenant so as to better utilise existing structures and reduce the cost and environmental impact of wholesale reinstatement of premises.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB's tenancy agreements require outgoing tenants to reinstate the premises before returning the premises to HDB, as all of these units will be released back to the market and taken up by new tenants. So, the reinstatement allows the incoming tenants to take over the premises quickly and gives them the flexibility to renovate the shop space based on their unique needs and requirements.  Nonetheless, to reduce wastage and costs, HDB is prepared and has allowed outgoing tenants to retain fixtures and fittings which are (a) in good and tenantable condition; (b) approved by the relevant authorities; and (c) deemed to be of use to the next tenant. Generally, these include common fixtures and fittings, such as floor tiles, power points and toilet fittings and fixtures."
demolition of sentosa merlion,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) whether all alternatives were explored before the decision was made to demolish the Sentosa Merlion; and (b) in light of the public sentiment from locals and tourists, whether the decision to demolish the Merlion will be reconsidered and, if not, whether there are plans to build another Merlion statue as a replacement.","Mr Chan Chun Sing: Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC) decided to demolish the Sentosa Merlion after exhausting all options of retaining or relocating it.  The size and location of the Sentosa Merlion will severely constrain the development of the surrounding area. It will also block access along the thoroughfare for the elderly and less mobile.It is not feasible to relocate the Sentosa Merlion. It is 37 metres tall, which is the same size as a 12-storey building with staircase, lift and other structural installations within it.We recognise that some members of the public have sentimental regard for the Sentosa Merlion. This is why its removal was a difficult decision for SDC. As there are five other replicas of the original Merlion in different parts of Singapore, there are no plans to build a replacement."
announced government budget for upgrading of public and private estates over next few years,Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for National Development with regard to the recent Government's announcement that $1 billion will be spent on upgrading public and private estates over the next few years (a) how much of the announced budget is expected to be allocated to improvements in private housing estates; and (b) how the Government ensures that spending on private estates is allocated in a fair and equitable manner across estates.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: MND will set aside $29 million to upgrade 10 private estates under the 10th batch of the Estate Upgrading Programme (EUP). In selecting estates for EUP, we consider the age and physical condition of the estate. We prioritise the estates with greater need for upgrading and with larger scope for improvement through the upgrading works. These tend to be older estates where there is room to upgrade their parks or playgrounds and to enhance barrier-free access, together with the covering of drains to create footpaths."
proportion of publicly accessible copyright digital materials held by nlb and nas,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) what proportion of publicly accessible digital materials held by NLB and NAS, the copyright of which belong to the Government, are downloadable; and (b) whether all such materials can be made available for download and, if not why.","Mr S Iswaran: One million and three hundred thousand digital Government materials are made publicly available across various NLB online platforms. These include annual reports, newsletters, school magazines, photographs, archived websites, Government files, oral history interviews, speeches and press releases. Approximately 88,000 are downloadable. Not all can be made available for download, due to conditions governing access stipulated by the respective agencies."
number of singaporeans and prs suffering from food insecurity over past five years and help measures available,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Social and Family Development over the past five years (a) what is the number of Singaporeans and PRs who are suffering from food insecurity, broken down to different extents; (b) how does the Government measure food insecurity and why is this method chosen; (c) what is the total amount of social welfare budget spent on providing food support; (d) how many charities in Singapore provide food support, broken down by type of food support; and (e) what is the total estimated operating expenditure of these charities in providing food support.","Mr Desmond Lee: Whilst MSF does not track the number of Singapore residents specifically experiencing food insecurity, we support low-income households in a number of ways, including with their food-related needs. When people apply to the Social Service Offices (SSOs) for assistance under ComCare, their needs are assessed holistically – finances, food, healthcare, employment, family-relationship issues, and housing. When ComCare financial assistance is provided, it includes provision for food. Based on the assessed needs, SSOs may also link families with other Government agencies and social service agencies for other forms of support. One example is MOH's Meals-on-Wheels programme, which provides cooked meal deliveries to eligible clients who are unable to buy and prepare their own meals.The community plays a strong role in complementing the Government's efforts on food issues. MSF is aware of more than 20 registered charities and a growing number of informal groups in Singapore providing a variety of food support, including cooked meals, dry rations, and perishables, such as bread and vegetables. Apart from such charities, grassroots organisations and religious organisations such as mosques, churches and temples also provide free food to those in need. These organisations and informal groups are largely volunteer-driven and collaborate closely with community agencies such as Family Service Centres in their food collection and distribution. These community efforts provide support for households to meet their food-related needs, while contributing to food sustainability and reduced food wastage in Singapore. Such collaborations are good examples of the impact the community can make and how the community can partner with the Government to support those in need. "
update on commercial for-profit surrogacy and deterrent measures in place,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Social and Family Development whether he can provide an update on the Ministry's position on commercial for-profit surrogacy and whether measures will be put in place to deter it.,"Mr Desmond Lee: Currently, Assisted Reproduction Technology (ART) centres in Singapore are not allowed to provide surrogacy treatment. We are still carefully reviewing our position on surrogacy, bearing in mind the following considerations.Surrogacy is a complex issue with several ethical, social, health and legal implications. Singapore's public policy encourages parenthood within marriage. Consistent with this, we will generally not object if married couples with fertility problems apply to the Singapore Court to adopt their children born through surrogacy that is carried out overseas. This is provided they are medically assessed to be unable to conceive children, and that the surrogacy arrangement is carried out in a jurisdiction where surrogacy is not illegal or unlawful.The Government does not encourage planned and deliberate single parenthood as a lifestyle choice. Hence, as a matter of public policy, we do not support the use of Assisted Reproduction Technology (ART) or surrogacy by singles to conceive children and adopt them. We also do not support the formation of same-sex families through adoption.All adoption applications will continue to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Besides factors concerning the child's well-being, such as parenting practices, family circumstances and available support networks, the circumstances surrounding each application must also be taken into account to ensure that the adoption does not go against public policy. It should thus not be taken as a matter of course that applications to adopt children born overseas and outside of wedlock would be successful."
measures to cope with haze and air pollution,"Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what measures will be implemented to help Singaporeans and residents cope with the worsening haze and air pollution; and (b) whether these measures will include the installation of air filter equipment in places frequented by the public, distribution of masks and public education on ways to minimise the impact on health.","20 Mr Alex Yam asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) how successful has the 2014 Transboundary Haze Pollution Act been in mitigating the annual threat of haze; (b) to date, how many successful cases have been investigated under the Act; (c) how many cases are currently under investigation; and (d) whether our neighbouring countries have been cooperative in providing assistance for investigation requests.21 Mr Alex Yam asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources in view of public feedback on the perceived ""inaccuracies"" of the 24-hour Pollutant Standards Index forecast currently used by NEA, whether the Ministry will consider adopting the hourly Air Quality Index now cast alongside the 1-hour PM2.5 concentration readings to assuage public concerns.22 Mr Charles Chong asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources what is the number of companies and individuals who have been investigated and prosecuted under the Transboundary Haze Pollution Act since commencement of the Act in 2014.23 Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what steps has Singapore taken to promote the sustainable production of palm oil, pulp, paper and other commodities from plantations so as to disincentivise plantation owners and farmers from using the slash and burn method of clearing land that causes transboundary haze; and (b) what is the Ministry's assessment of the effectiveness of these steps.24 Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources what steps have been identified to overcome the difficulty of gathering evidence against entities believed to have caused transboundary haze in contravention of the Transboundary Haze Pollution Act 2014.25 Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether there are plans for the Government, businesses and the community to work hand-in-hand to distribute N95 masks to low-income and vulnerable seniors when the Pollutant Standards Index readings hits very unhealthy or hazardous levels.26 Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources what can Singapore do to make it commercially unviable for companies in the region to operate slash and burn tactics for clearing of land.27 Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources in light of the haze recurrence (a) whether measures and action plans implemented previously to help our neighbours are no longer effective; and (b) what is the action plan moving forward to help our neighbours prevent or reduce the hotspots for the long term.28 Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether NEA is able to identify any land owners in Indonesia who are responsible for the burning of forest land that causes haze and whether any prosecution action will be taken against these land owners.29 Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) how the cost of haze pollution to Singapore can be estimated; and (b) what are the Government's estimates of previous years' cost impact arising from haze pollution on health, education and business.30 Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) how effective has the Transboundary Haze Pollution Act 2014 been in holding companies and individuals accountable for causing haze pollution; and (b) what is the number of perpetrators who have been prosecuted under the Act.31 Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what are the haze assistance efforts extended to Indonesia this year; (b) how much of the assistance efforts have been accepted; and (c) what are the long-term collaboration plans with leaders in the region to mitigate transboundary haze.32 Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources how can the Government minimise and manage the impact of haze on the public and the Government's policy in the distribution of the national stockpile of N95 masks.33 Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether and to what extent the Transboundary Haze Pollution Act has been effective at addressing transboundary haze; (b) what is the progress on existing investigations under the Act of the four firms linked to the 2015 haze; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider strengthening the Transboundary Haze Pollution Act with financial incentives for whistle-blowers who contribute substantially to the identification and prosecution of entities contributing to haze pollution.34 Prof Lim Sun Sun asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources why there have been no prosecutions to date under the Transboundary Haze Pollution Act 2014 despite the ample legal and evidentiary mechanisms available under the Act.35 Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether he can provide an update on (i) the outlook for haze affecting Singapore in the months ahead (ii) diplomatic efforts to mitigate haze generation in Indonesia and (iii) domestic efforts to mitigate the public health impact.36 Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what are the considerations behind NEA's decision to report air quality based on 24-hour PSI and 1-hour PM 2.5 readings; and (b) what is the Government's assessment of the utility of the above readings to the population vis-á-vis other indices or measures.37 Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources how has the enactment of the Transboundary Haze Pollution Act 2014 enhanced Singapore's response to transboundary haze pollution.Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Haze has affected ASEAN for years. It has been a perennial scourge in our region, affecting millions of people. Haze pollutes the air we breathe and sets back global efforts in tackling climate change. The 2015 fires in Indonesia generated nearly 1 gigatonne of carbon dioxide; more than half of the 1.5 gigatonne that was saved from the increased use of renewable energy by the whole world for that year. A study by Prof Euston Quah and Assoc Prof Chia Wai Mun from Nanyang Technological University estimated that the cost to Singapore of the two-month long 2015 haze episode was $1.83 billion or 0.45% of our GDP, taking into account factors such as health cost, loss in productivity, and impact on tourism and business. This year, fires in Indonesia have released 360 million tonnes of carbon dioxide since August, more than Spain's emissions for the whole of 2018. Lives have been lost, and the health and livelihoods of millions impacted.The Government adopts a multi-pronged approach to tackle transboundary haze and mitigate its impact on Singaporeans. First, we have been undertaking diplomatic and regional efforts to tackle the haze problem. As early as April, I have written to my Indonesian counterpart to convey Singapore's readiness to assist Indonesia in tackling land and forest fires. When the haze situation in Singapore worsened in September, CEO of National Environment Agency (NEA) wrote to his counterpart on 16 September to convey concerns about the haze situation and details of the fire-fighting assets that Singapore could activate to help Indonesia deal with the escalating number of hotspots. We also sent Indonesia a diplomatic note on the same day. On 19 September, CEO (NEA) wrote again to his counterpart after Indonesia announced that it had sealed off plantations operated by several companies, including Singapore-registered ones, after detecting fires in their concessions. CEO (NEA) requested for the offences committed and further information from the Indonesian government to support NEA's investigations. We sent Indonesia a diplomatic note on 20 September expressing our concerns over the escalation of hotspots and sought their assistance to enhance measures on the ground to prevent and mitigate the occurrence of forest and land fires. Additionally, CEO (NEA) wrote on 4 October to his counterpart to further request information on all companies suspected of intentionally burning land. We have yet to receive any response from the Indonesian Government thus far.Singapore is supportive of the Indonesian Government's continuing efforts to suppress the forest and land fires. We recognise President Joko Widodo's personal attention and efforts in tackling this problem. The key is to prevent the fires from starting in the first place. Errant individuals and companies whose actions jeopardise the health and lives of people in ASEAN and which set back our efforts to fight climate change must be held accountable. Strong enforcement action must be taken against perpetrators and to deter others.  Singapore also works closely with other ASEAN member states to monitor hotspot activities to support measures to reduce fires. For more than two decades, the ASEAN Specialised Meteorological Centre (ASMC), which Singapore hosts, has been sharing regional weather and haze outlook, and satellite information with ASEAN Member States. The ASMC plays a critical regional role. Its technical assessments and updates on the haze situation, along with the ASMC's meteorological forecasts and data on hotspot activities, support efforts to prevent, detect and fight fires. In addition, Singapore is helping fellow ASEAN member states build their capability in haze monitoring as well as weather and climate prediction. Singapore has contributed $5 million to the ASMC for a five-year regional capability building programme.But we also need greater urgency and political resolve, as well as closer cooperation amongst ASEAN countries and stakeholders if we are to make progress towards a haze-free ASEAN. This is why Singapore has been participating actively and contributing at all regional haze-related meetings, such as the 21st meeting of the Sub-Regional Ministerial Steering Committee (MSC) on Transboundary Haze Pollution held in Brunei on 6 August. The MSC is an annual Ministerial-level meeting which is convened in the run-up to the dry season in the Southern ASEAN region. This year's meeting noted the ASMC's report about the potential escalation of hotspot activities and increased risk of transboundary haze due to drier and warmer weather. I reminded ASEAN member states that transboundary haze remained a major concern for the region and the need for preparedness. MSC member countries – Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand – had reaffirmed their readiness to enhance cooperation and coordination to address land and forest fires. At the same meeting, MSC member countries also reaffirmed their commitment to the objectives and principles of the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution (AATHP) and the Roadmap on ASEAN Cooperation towards Transboundary Haze Pollution Control with Means of Implementation. The 10 ASEAN countries, which are signatories to the AATHP, will meet in Cambodia on 8 to 9 October 2019 to take stock of the implementation of the Agreement and discuss how to further enhance its implementation. Senior Minister of State Dr Amy Khor will lead the Singapore delegation at the coming meeting. She will reiterate our concerns about the detrimental effects of haze, its impact on climate change and global emissions of greenhouse gas, and urge all ASEAN member states to take strong action to prevent the recurrence of haze.Second, recognising that strong enforcement on the ground is needed to prevent the recurrent fires, Singapore enacted the Transboundary Haze Pollution Act (THPA) in 2014 to send a strong signal that we will not tolerate the irresponsible actions of errant companies, whether Singapore-based or otherwise, that harm our environment. In 2015, NEA issued legal notices under the THPA to six companies to take immediate measures to stop the fires that caused haze that affected Singapore. Two of the companies have responded and explained that they were no longer associated with the affected lands. Upon further investigation, NEA accepted their explanation and closed these two cases. As for the other four companies, their cases are still open. A director of one of these companies was served a THPA Notice to be interviewed by NEA when he was in Singapore. When he failed to turn up for the interview, a court warrant was obtained to secure his attendance when he next enters Singapore. NEA is on the lookout for other directors of these companies, and will similarly require them to assist in the investigations when they are in Singapore.Singapore therefore welcomes the Indonesian Ministry of the Environment and Forestry's efforts to pursue action against errant companies culpable for the fires, subjecting them to the full extent of the law, and pursuing necessary evidence to do so. As mentioned earlier, CEO (NEA) has written to his Indonesian counterpart to request for more information pertaining to this year's fires, so that we can investigate on our end. For this year's haze episode, NEA is closely monitoring the situation and will update as appropriate. We hope that the Indonesian Government will work with Singapore and other countries in the region by sharing substantiated information that could help identify companies suspected of causing fires. Indonesia should also publish information on land ownership and concession boundaries that can help ascertain which companies are involved. Indonesia's cooperation in this will be useful and necessary in providing the evidence of wrongdoing by any company that has contributed to haze in Singapore.  The THPA complements the efforts of Indonesia and other countries to hold companies to account and is not intended to replace their laws and enforcement actions. We respect the sovereignty of others but States also have a responsibility to ensure that the activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction. Given that these fires occur abroad, regional cooperation remains crucial in resolving transboundary haze pollution. We are pleased that Malaysia is also considering similar legislation. We remain committed to work with other countries to find a solution, as well as collaborate through ASEAN and other international platforms such as the UN.The THPA is not a panacea or the only tool to fight transboundary haze. Although none of the investigated companies has been prosecuted yet, the THPA has nevertheless put added pressure on companies to behave responsibly. We have no plans to amend the THPA at this moment.Third, consumer choices and demand play a crucial role in shaping the practices of forestry and palm oil industries. As more consumers opt for sustainable products, this will incentivise companies to adopt more sustainable practices which in turn contributes to reducing haze. For example, under the World Wildlife Fund Singapore's Southeast Asia Alliance on Sustainable Palm Oil (SASPO), efforts are being led by the industry and there is growing momentum towards adopting sustainable and responsible practices. The Singapore Environment Council (SEC) has established the enhanced Singapore Green Labelling Scheme (SGLS+) to help consumers identify sustainable pulp and paper. This certification demands full disclosure of the company's supply chain, imposes the legal sourcing of all fibre, has a zero-burning policy and includes fire and peatland management. Assessment is done through site audits, evaluation and risk assessments of companies' concession lands. As of 26 September 2019, 10 companies have achieved the SGLS+ certification. SEC will take punitive actions such as revocation of certification if there is proof of wrongdoing relating to companies of SGLS+ certified pulp and paper products. Financial institutions can exercise influence over regional forestry and palm oil companies, and promote the adoption of sustainable practices through their lending and investment activities. The Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) released a set of responsible financing guidelines in October 2015, comprising environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria. In 2017, the ABS released the Haze Diagnostic Kit which provides best practices guidelines for member banks to assess their clients' commitments to haze risk management. To support climate-related disclosures, the Singapore Exchange introduced the ""Comply or Explain"" Sustainability Reporting Guide for listed companies, beginning from the financial year ending on or after 31 December 2017. Another important signal is that our investment entities do not invest in errant companies. Temasek Holdings has stated publicly that they consider ESG factors when making decisions as an investor looking to deliver returns on a sustainable basis and they fully support no burn policies for land clearance. GIC has also stated that they integrate sustainability considerations holistically into their investment processes.Fourth, to provide the public with timely information to safeguard their health and well-being, NEA has been issuing daily advisories on the haze situation since 4 August this year. The daily advisories provide the forecast of the Pollutant Standards Index or PSI for the next 24 hours which could be used as the basis for major decisions, such as school closure. This is in addition to the 1-hour PM2.5 levels and 24-hour PSI which are updated every hour and are available online and on the MyENV mobile application. During transboundary haze episodes, PM2.5 is the dominant pollutant and has the most influence on the PSI. The 1-hour PM2.5 levels provide an indicative measure of the current air quality, and is a useful indicator to guide immediate activities, such as whether or not to exercise outdoors. Fifth, to minimise the impact of haze on the public, the Government has since 1994 set up a Haze Task Force (HTF), comprising 28 Government agencies. This is led by NEA. The HTF convened in early May this year, before the dry season, to begin preparations for a potential haze situation. With the onset of haze in mid-September, the HTF agencies have been rolling out actions to protect the health and well-being of the public, especially the more vulnerable groups such as the elderly, pregnant women, children, and people with chronic lung and heart diseases. MOH worked with our healthcare institutions, including public hospitals, polyclinics and nursing homes, to prepare for any increase in the number of cases of haze-related conditions and on the timely activation of haze preparedness measures. These measures include using air purifiers and fans, and reducing ambient temperature by deploying portable air coolers where appropriate. Our public healthcare institutions are also monitoring patients closely for possible health effects of the haze and will institute appropriate medical intervention where necessary.In addition, all classrooms of Primary and Secondary schools, MOE Kindergartens and Special Education schools have been equipped with air purifiers to enhance the well-being of students during a haze situation. Teachers will also be on the look-out for students who are unwell or have pre-existing lung or heart conditions. Contingency plans are in place should there be haze during the examinations period.The HTF has also ensured that additional stocks of N95 masks are pushed out to retail shops, and there are sufficient stocks in the warehouses and Government stockpiles. The Singapore Government has a national stockpile of 16 million N95 masks. The HTF has plans in place to distribute N95 masks to vulnerable and needy residents if the 24-hour PSI crosses into the ""Very Unhealthy"" (PSI 201-300) range. N95 masks are, however, not required for short exposure, like commuting from home to school or work, or in an indoor environment. The elderly, pregnant women and those with severe lung or heart problems who have difficulty breathing at rest or on exertion should consult their doctor as to whether they should use the N95 mask.We have considered cloud-seeding but there is a lack of reliable means to validate its effectiveness for Singapore. Given our small size and the variability of winds, the induced rain, if any, may not fall directly over our island. In the first half of October, the Southwest Monsoon is expected to transition to inter-monsoon conditions characterised by light and variable winds and increased showers. Some parts of the region can still experience periods of dry weather in October, and hotspot activities may persist in parts of Sumatra and Kalimantan. However, the change in wind conditions will help to reduce the risk of transboundary haze affecting Singapore.NEA will continue to monitor the haze situation closely. For updates, members of the public can visit the NEA website (www.nea.gov.sg), MSS website (www.weather.gov.sg), the haze microsite (www.haze.gov.sg), mobile apps (myEnv and Weather@SG) or follow NEA Facebook (www.facebook.com/NEASingapore) and NEA Twitter (@NEAsg). For information on the distribution of hotspots detected over the past fortnight in the region, please refer to the ASEAN Specialised Meteorological Centre (ASMC) website at asmc.asean.org."
plans to enhance awareness and strengthen policing of illegal subletting in private properties,"Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for National Development (a) in the past five years, what is the number of cases of illegal subletting in private properties; (b) whether there is a need to enhance the awareness of private property owners about illegal subletting; and (c) whether the Ministry has any plans to further strengthen the policing of illegal subletting and take stronger legal action against agents, tenants or landlords who illegally sublet their properties.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Subletting of private residential properties is only allowed for stays of at least three consecutive months. There is also an occupancy cap of six unrelated persons in each unit.In the past five years, URA investigated an average of about 600 cases involving suspected breaches of the minimum stay duration and an average of over a thousand cases of suspected breaches of the occupancy cap each year. In condominium developments, URA works closely with Management Corporations to raise awareness of the minimum stay duration and occupancy cap among homeowners and to identify units suspected to be in breach of the regulations. Where an offence is established, URA will take appropriate action against those responsible. These include not just direct perpetrators, but also landlords who fail to exercise the necessary due diligence to prevent infringements in their properties, even if the offence was carried out by the tenant.For marginal breaches of the regulations, URA may issue a composition fine of up to $5,000. Since May 2019, URA has issued 23 composition fines for illegal subletting offences. Recalcitrant and serious offenders, for example, those operating on a commercial scale, will be prosecuted in Court and face significantly heavier penalties upon conviction, such as fines of up to $200,000 or imprisonment of up to 12 months. Since the implementation of these measures, 18 individuals and companies have been prosecuted in court for illegal subletting offences. Of these offenders, 11 have been convicted and sentenced to fines as high as $70,000. Another seven cases are currently before the Courts. Several of these cases were reported in the media. We will continue to raise awareness of the regulations, as well as the penalties faced by those who breach them.Apart from property owners and tenants, action will be taken against other parties responsible for illegal subletting offences. For example, where estate agents are found to be complicit in such offences, CEA will take action, which could include revoking the registration of the agent or debarring them for a period of time. MOM will also take enforcement action against errant employers who house foreign workers in poor living conditions. URA will continue to step up its investigation and enforcement efforts."
most common mosquito breeding grounds,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) in the past five years, which is the most common area that residents have neglected resulting in mosquito breeding; (b) how many areas are at common areas (i) outside their house and (ii) within their house respectively; and (c) how many houses have been forced open for inspection in the absence of a response from owners/tenants.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: From 2014 to 2018, the National Environmental Agency (NEA) conducted an average of 1.3 million inspections annually, which uncovered more than 17,000 mosquito breeding habitats each year. The most common mosquito breeding habitats found in homes were domestic containers, such as pails, dish trays, flower pot plates and ornamental containers such as vases. The most common habitats detected in common areas were closed perimeter drains, discarded receptacles and gully traps.NEA takes a systematic and holistic approach to arrest dengue transmission in Singapore. NEA conducts Gravitrap surveillance, regular inspections of premises for potential breeding sites and intensive search-and-destroy operations to remove mosquito breeding habitats. Through NEA's public communication efforts and the support of grassroots organisations, most residents understand the danger of dengue transmission and have been cooperative in facilitating NEA's home inspections. For premises which NEA officers are unable to gain access to, for example when no one is at home, NEA will serve a letter to the owner or occupier to arrange for another date to inspect the unit. If our officers are still unable to enter the premises at the next inspection, a legal notice under section 35 of the Control of Vectors and Pesticides Act (CVPA) will be served to the occupiers, requiring them to open their homes for inspection at a specified time. If the owners or occupiers still fail to contact NEA and all attempts to contact the owners or occupiers via neighbours, grassroots, neighbourhood police and official records again fail, NEA will invoke section 36 of the CVPA to gain entry into the premises to check for mosquito breeding. From 2014 to 2018, 214 homes were inspected under section 36 of the CVPA.We need to remain vigilant and continue to work as a community to prevent mosquito breeding and keep dengue transmission in check. Everyone can play a part in preventing dengue by regularly doing the five-step Mozzie Wipeout. "
insect farms in singapore,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) how many insect farms are currently located in Singapore; (b) what types of insects are currently allowed to be cultivated in Singapore; and (c) whether there are plans to allow for post-consumer food waste to be used for insect farming to help in recycling food waste.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: There are currently two licensed establishments in Singapore that rear insects. One of them is licensed by the Animal & Veterinary Service (AVS) as it rears insects for pet food.The other is licensed by the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) as it rears insects to produce animal feed. This establishment rears Black Soldier Fly Larvae (BSFL) using waste streams from local food manufacturing companies such as okara, a by-product of soybean milk and tofu manufacturing, and spent brewery grains. The BSFL are processed into aquaculture feed for fish.As part of the licensing requirements for establishments rearing insects to produce animal feed, SFA requires that the substances used to feed the insects are properly handled and traceable to ensure the safety of insect-derived animal feed.Insects can be a good alternative source of feed for animals reared for food, due to their high feed conversion efficiency. This also supports Singapore's efforts to pursue circular economy approaches to reduce waste and be more environmentally sustainable. However, insect farming is still a developing field. SFA is closely monitoring developments in this area, such as rearing practices, research and scientific literature, as well as relevant regulations adopted by overseas regulatory authorities. SFA will continue to refine its regulations and support for insect farming in Singapore."
update on nea life cycle assessment study on plastics,"Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources when will the NEA life cycle assessment study on plastics be made public in its entirety for the use of academics, professionals and the lay public so as to promote an evidence-based approach to climate solutions suited for the Singapore context.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The National Environment Agency (NEA) commissioned a lifecycle assessment (LCA) study on carrier bags and food packaging in September 2016, in order to take an evidence-based approach to the issue of disposables in Singapore. It was conducted by Assoc Prof Kua Harn Wei from NUS School of Design and Environment (SDE) and his team of researchers from SDE and NUS Environmental Research Institute. NEA released a factsheet on the key findings in 2018. The key findings showed that every type of material, including bio-degradable and paper materials, imposed different environmental impacts, and that consumers can reduce their impact on the environment by opting to use reusable bags and food containers, instead of disposables. We therefore encourage the public to reduce the excessive consumption of all types of disposables and to use reusables where possible.NEA will work with NUS to release more information on the study, focusing on the methodologies and assumptions. This approach will enhance readability and ease of understanding by the general public. We will release the additional information when ready."
mean and median mortgage service ratio for single hdb flat in last five years,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for National Development in each of the last five years (a) what has been the mean and median mortgage service ratio (MSR) for those servicing mortgage loans for only a single HDB flat; and (b) how many HDB lessees have been allowed to exceed the MSR ceiling, if any.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Between 2014 and 2018, the mean and median mortgage service ratios (MSRs) of HDB housing loans disbursed at key collection were similar – these ratios have been stable at around 20% for new flat purchases and 25% for resale flat purchases. As flat buyers are required to dispose of any existing property after they collect the keys to their flat, they will be servicing an HDB housing loan for a single flat.The Mortgage Servicing Ratio (MSR) cap of 30% of flat buyers' income is one of the criteria used to determine the maximum loan amount that flat buyers are eligible for when they apply for a housing loan to purchase an HDB flat or executive condominium. However, some flat buyers choose to shorten their loan tenure to minimise interest costs. For a small number of such flat buyers, around 3% of those who collected keys to their HDB flats in 2018, while their approved loan amount adheres to the MSR cap over the maximum applicable loan tenure, their mortgage instalment over the shortened loan tenure may exceed 30% of their monthly income.  "
average amount of funds seniors received through lease buyback scheme,Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for National Development (a) what are the average amounts of funds that seniors receive in CPF and cash by monetising their HDB flats through the Lease Buy Back Scheme; and (b) how has this scheme boosted their retirement adequacy whilst continuing to live out their retirement in their flats.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The Lease Buyback Scheme (LBS) was enhanced in April 2015 to extend to 4-room flats and provide seniors with more choices in the length of lease to retain. Since then, seniors who took up the LBS received average proceeds of $177,000 per household, including the LBS cash bonus. The proportion of proceeds that they receive in their CPF Retirement Account (RA) and in cash depends on their CPF RA balances before they took up the LBS. In general, seniors who had higher CPF RA balances to begin with would get a higher proportion of their proceeds in cash. After taking up the LBS, most seniors have enough CPF RA savings to benefit from a lifelong income stream of about $1,000 per month on a household basis under CPF LIFE. Beyond that, most seniors also receive some of their LBS proceeds in cash, in addition to the cash bonus. "
standardising labelling and colour coding of all recycling bins,"Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether the Ministry plans to align and standardise the colour codes of all recycling bins beyond housing estates to the shopping malls, hotels, offices and industrial estates for easy recall and identification as there is currently no consistency in how bins are labelled and can be confusing to users.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Currently, owners of commercial and industrial premises have the flexibility to choose the type and colour of recycling bins and recycling bin labels used on their premises. This is to cater to the different considerations that building owners may have, such as the recycling culture and awareness level of building occupants, space availability, and the overall design and aesthetics of the premises. Notwithstanding this, my Ministry and the National Environment Agency (NEA) will study further the standardising of recycling bin colours. The NEA will consult the various stakeholders involved, such as waste collectors and building owners. "
correct disposal method for household pharmaceutical waste,"Ms Irene Quay Siew Ching asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources what is the correct disposal method for household pharmaceutical waste consisting of cytotoxics, antibiotics and controlled drugs.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Generally, household pharmaceutical waste, including those consisting of cytotoxics, antibiotics and controlled drugs, can be safely disposed of together with household general waste. All our household waste is collected by licensed waste collectors and safely incinerated at our waste-to-energy incineration plants before the ash is landfilled at Semakau Landfill."
statistics on return to nursing programme and outreach efforts,"Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Health (a) in the past five years, what is the annual average number of years of service among nurses who have left the service; (b) what are the efforts to encourage former nurses who have left service to return to nursing; and (c) how many former nurses have re-joined nursing under the Return to Nursing Programme since the programme was launched in 2010.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Nurses who left the public healthcare sector in the past five years spent an average of seven years in service. This includes nurses who left to join the private healthcare and community care sectors as well as those who left nursing practice. MOH welcomes all local non-practising nurses to return to the healthcare workforce. To facilitate their return, we have in place a Return to Nursing (RTN) scheme, which includes a refresher course. Over the years, we have enhanced the scheme. For instance, we have adopted a Place-and-Train format for the scheme where returning nurses first secure employment with their employers before commencing the refresher course. As a result, nurses are paid a salary while attending the course and the cost of the course is jointly borne by employers and the Government, and not the nurses. In the last 10 years, about 120 nurses have benefited from the RTN scheme. Overall, about 400 local nurses have returned to practice annually1."
measures to attract students and healthcare professionals to specialise in geriatric medicine,Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked the Minister for Health (a) what are the measures to attract more students and healthcare professionals to specialise in geriatric medicine and other relevant specialties; and (b) how effective have these measures been so far.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: To meet the needs of our ageing population, we need more healthcare professionals who are trained to serve older patients in general. We also need more specialists in geriatric medicine and related fields such as rehabilitation care and palliative care.Today, all medical students are exposed to geriatric medicine and related disciplines early in their training. In addition, MOH has increased the number of training positions for specialists in these disciplines. From 2013 to 2019, the specialist training intake for geriatric medicine, rehabilitation medicine and palliative medicine more than doubled from 11 to 23 positions. Specialists trained in Geriatric Medicine receive an additional allowance.To raise the ability of our pharmacists to care for the elderly, a local training programme in Geriatric Pharmacy was started in 2016. The programme has trained three pharmacists to date, and aims to train another nine pharmacists in the next three years. For nursing, hospitals are conducting in-house structured courses on Gerontology Nursing to equip nurses with the skills and knowledge in caring for older adults. Specialty training, such as the Advanced Diploma in Nursing (Gerontology), are also available for nurses who are interested in this field. In the last seven years, 497 nurses have undergone this diploma. "
"plans to reduce use of hand dryers in hospitals, nursing home and clinics","Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked the Minister for Health in view of the research findings that there are higher amounts of bacteria, including antibiotic resistant ones, in the air and bathroom surfaces where jet-air hand dryers are used compared to paper hand towels, whether there are plans to reduce the number of hand dryers in our hospitals, nursing homes and clinics and increase the provision of paper towels instead.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Our public healthcare institutions have in place infection prevention and control (IPC) programmes in accordance with the Ministry of Health (MOH) Guidelines. The programmes are aligned with international best practices to minimise the transmission of bacteria and reduce healthcare-associated infections. In patient care areas, such as inpatient wards and outpatient consultation rooms, paper hand towels are provided for the drying of hands after handwashing.  In some public areas, jet-air hand dryers may be available. Routine cleaning are undertaken using hospital-grade cleaning agents and disinfectants to minimise the transmission of bacteria. All healthcare institutions also adopt hand hygiene practices, which include staff using alcohol-based hand rub before contact with patients. Visitors are also encouraged to observe hand hygiene when they are in patient care areas. All of us can also play our part by washing our hands before and after visiting our friends and relatives in hospitals."

After taking up the LBS, most seniors have enough CPF RA savings to benefit from a lifelong income stream of about $1,000 per month on a household basis under CPF LIFE. Beyond that, most seniors also receive some of their LBS proceeds in cash, in addition to the cash bonus. "
standardising labelling and colour coding of all recycling bins,"Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether the Ministry plans to align and standardise the colour codes of all recycling bins beyond housing estates to the shopping malls, hotels, offices and industrial estates for easy recall and identification as there is currently no consistency in how bins are labelled and can be confusing to users.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Currently, owners of commercial and industrial premises have the flexibility to choose the type and colour of recycling bins and recycling bin labels used on their premises. This is to cater to the different considerations that building owners may have, such as the recycling culture and awareness level of building occupants, space availability, and the overall design and aesthetics of the premises. Notwithstanding this, my Ministry and the National Environment Agency (NEA) will study further the standardising of recycling bin colours. The NEA will consult the various stakeholders involved, such as waste collectors and building owners. "
correct disposal method for household pharmaceutical waste,"Ms Irene Quay Siew Ching asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources what is the correct disposal method for household pharmaceutical waste consisting of cytotoxics, antibiotics and controlled drugs.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Generally, household pharmaceutical waste, including those consisting of cytotoxics, antibiotics and controlled drugs, can be safely disposed of together with household general waste. All our household waste is collected by licensed waste collectors and safely incinerated at our waste-to-energy incineration plants before the ash is landfilled at Semakau Landfill."
statistics on return to nursing programme and outreach efforts,"Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Health (a) in the past five years, what is the annual average number of years of service among nurses who have left the service; (b) what are the efforts to encourage former nurses who have left service to return to nursing; and (c) how many former nurses have re-joined nursing under the Return to Nursing Programme since the programme was launched in 2010.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Nurses who left the public healthcare sector in the past five years spent an average of seven years in service. This includes nurses who left to join the private healthcare and community care sectors as well as those who left nursing practice. MOH welcomes all local non-practising nurses to return to the healthcare workforce. To facilitate their return, we have in place a Return to Nursing (RTN) scheme, which includes a refresher course. Over the years, we have enhanced the scheme. For instance, we have adopted a Place-and-Train format for the scheme where returning nurses first secure employment with their employers before commencing the refresher course. As a result, nurses are paid a salary while attending the course and the cost of the course is jointly borne by employers and the Government, and not the nurses. In the last 10 years, about 120 nurses have benefited from the RTN scheme. Overall, about 400 local nurses have returned to practice annually1."
measures to attract students and healthcare professionals to specialise in geriatric medicine,Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked the Minister for Health (a) what are the measures to attract more students and healthcare professionals to specialise in geriatric medicine and other relevant specialties; and (b) how effective have these measures been so far.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: To meet the needs of our ageing population, we need more healthcare professionals who are trained to serve older patients in general. We also need more specialists in geriatric medicine and related fields such as rehabilitation care and palliative care.Today, all medical students are exposed to geriatric medicine and related disciplines early in their training. In addition, MOH has increased the number of training positions for specialists in these disciplines. From 2013 to 2019, the specialist training intake for geriatric medicine, rehabilitation medicine and palliative medicine more than doubled from 11 to 23 positions. Specialists trained in Geriatric Medicine receive an additional allowance.To raise the ability of our pharmacists to care for the elderly, a local training programme in Geriatric Pharmacy was started in 2016. The programme has trained three pharmacists to date, and aims to train another nine pharmacists in the next three years. For nursing, hospitals are conducting in-house structured courses on Gerontology Nursing to equip nurses with the skills and knowledge in caring for older adults. Specialty training, such as the Advanced Diploma in Nursing (Gerontology), are also available for nurses who are interested in this field. In the last seven years, 497 nurses have undergone this diploma. "
"plans to reduce use of hand dryers in hospitals, nursing home and clinics","Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked the Minister for Health in view of the research findings that there are higher amounts of bacteria, including antibiotic resistant ones, in the air and bathroom surfaces where jet-air hand dryers are used compared to paper hand towels, whether there are plans to reduce the number of hand dryers in our hospitals, nursing homes and clinics and increase the provision of paper towels instead.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Our public healthcare institutions have in place infection prevention and control (IPC) programmes in accordance with the Ministry of Health (MOH) Guidelines. The programmes are aligned with international best practices to minimise the transmission of bacteria and reduce healthcare-associated infections. In patient care areas, such as inpatient wards and outpatient consultation rooms, paper hand towels are provided for the drying of hands after handwashing.  In some public areas, jet-air hand dryers may be available. Routine cleaning are undertaken using hospital-grade cleaning agents and disinfectants to minimise the transmission of bacteria. All healthcare institutions also adopt hand hygiene practices, which include staff using alcohol-based hand rub before contact with patients. Visitors are also encouraged to observe hand hygiene when they are in patient care areas. All of us can also play our part by washing our hands before and after visiting our friends and relatives in hospitals."
update on response to walk-in selection of balance flats,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development (a) what has been the response to the walk-in selection of balance flats since its launch recently; and (b) whether HDB will consider allowing all balance flats to be available for application and selection on a daily basis instead of quarterly.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB launched the open booking of flats on 11 June 2019. This allows home seekers to view details of flats on offer at the HDB InfoWEB every day, apply online on a first-come-first-served basis, and book a flat as early as the next working day. Response to the open booking of flats has been good. About half of the available flats were taken up before the open booking was temporarily suspended on 7 August 2019 to prepare for more flats to be offered. Online applications for the open booking of flats have resumed as of 25 September 2019, and HDB will continue to track the public response.Other than open booking, HDB also offers balance flats via the Sale of Balance Flats and Re-Offer of Balance Flats exercises. These exercises offer other advantages, such as priority allocation for specific target groups like first-timer families.HDB will continue to monitor public response to the various sales modes and refine the processes where necessary to better meet the needs of home seekers."
complaints on vendors engaging in free gifts marketing techniques and actions taken,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Trade and Industry since July last year (a) whether the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore has received any complaints about vendors who engaged in free gifts marketing techniques and, if so, whether actions have been taken under the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act; and (b) of these vendors who have not been censured, why not.","Mr Chan Chun Sing: Er Dr Lee Bee Wah had highlighted reports of sales persons marketing ""freebie"" bags to senior citizens in her Parliamentary Question in July 2018. The Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore did not receive any consumer complaints regarding such practices. If consumers have reason to believe that suppliers have engaged in unfair practices, such as pressure-selling or false claims, they can approach the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) with details of these practices for CASE to assist them in seeking redress from the suppliers. Consumers are also encouraged to take pre-emptive measures to protect themselves against unfair practices. For example, they can check the reputation of the supplier, ask questions about the products and examine the products before making the purchase. "
update on manpower gap in healthcare sector and current shortfall of nurses,"Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the healthcare sector has managed to fill the manpower gap of 30,000 more healthcare workers from 2015 to 2020; (b) what is the current shortfall of nurses; and (c) what is the adoption rate of flexi-working hours and part-time working arrangements among nurses.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Singapore's overall healthcare workforce grew significantly by about 18,000 staff over the last four years. For nurses, there were about 42,000 nurses registered with the Singapore Nursing Board (SNB) at the end of 2018, up from about 38,000 as at end 2014. To optimise the use of manpower resources, we have embarked on efforts to raise productivity.These include initiatives on automation, streamlining of work processes, and shifting of care from hospitals into the community where appropriate.On average between 2015 and 2018, around 3% of our practising nurses across the entire healthcare sector, work on a part-time basis1."
increase in dental treatment charges in last 10 years and efforts to stem rising costs,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Health how much have dental treatment charges risen in the last 10 years and what the Ministry is doing to stem the rising costs.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: To keep basic dental treatment costs affordable for Singaporeans, subsidised dental care services are available at 10 polyclinics and about 700 dental clinics on the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS). Polyclinic patients, as well as CHAS Blue and Orange, Pioneer Generation, and soon Merdeka Generation cardholders, may also be referred for subsidised dental treatments at the National Dental Centre Singapore and National University Centre for Oral Health Singapore. Patients can also tap on their MediSave savings for more complex dental procedures such as dental implants and wisdom tooth surgeries. Based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) compiled by the Singapore Department of Statistics (DOS), the inflation rate for dental services, after Government subsidies, was 2.1% per annum between 2009 and 2018. The average bill size for polyclinics and average charges for CHAS dental clinics for subsidised dental treatments grew by about 1% per annum from 2012 to 2018. "
take-up rate for eldercarer foreign domestic worker and plans to expand scheme to include people with special needs,Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Health (a) what has been the take-up rate of the Eldercarer Foreign Domestic Worker (FDW) Scheme which provides FDWs with comprehensive training in eldercare; and (b) whether there are plans to expand or develop the scheme to include training FDWs to care for people with special needs.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Eldercarer Foreign Domestic Worker (FDW) Scheme was started in November 2016 to provide eldercare training to FDWs prior to their placements with households. The FDWs undergo a Basic Eldercare Course, comprising two days of classroom training and half a day of on-the-job training on managing the day-to-day care of an elderly person. Households can apply for the Caregivers Training Grant (CTG), which is an annual $200 subsidy, per care recipient, that can be used to offset the Eldercarer FDW Scheme training cost. As of 30 September 2019, 413 FDWs have been trained under the scheme.  Similarly, households who wish to equip their FDWs to care for persons with special needs can apply for the CTG as well. In addition to eldercare courses, the CTG also covers courses that specifically train caregivers to care for persons with special needs, such as autism and intellectual disabilities."
economic and other benefits of hosting f1 singapore grand prix beyond 2021,Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for Trade and Industry what are the economic and other benefits of hosting the F1 Singapore Grand Prix and whether there are continuing benefits for Singapore to host the race beyond 2021.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: Between 2008 and 2018, more than 490,000 international visitors have attended the Formula One Singapore Grand Prix, contributing more than S$1.4 billion in tourism receipts and benefiting local businesses. The event has also been broadcast to a global audience of more than 840 million viewers.  We will assess the costs versus the benefits of our options, to decide whether to continue having F1 in Singapore beyond 2021."
number of singaporeans and prs suffering from food insecurity over past five years and help measures available,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Social and Family Development over the past five years (a) what is the number of Singaporeans and PRs who are suffering from food insecurity, broken down to different extents; (b) how does the Government measure food insecurity and why is this method chosen; (c) what is the total amount of social welfare budget spent on providing food support; (d) how many charities in Singapore provide food support, broken down by type of food support; and (e) what is the total estimated operating expenditure of these charities in providing food support.","Mr Desmond Lee: Whilst MSF does not track the number of Singapore residents specifically experiencing food insecurity, we support low-income households in a number of ways, including with their food-related needs. When people apply to the Social Service Offices (SSOs) for assistance under ComCare, their needs are assessed holistically – finances, food, healthcare, employment, family-relationship issues, and housing. When ComCare financial assistance is provided, it includes provision for food. Based on the assessed needs, SSOs may also link families with other Government agencies and social service agencies for other forms of support. One example is MOH's Meals-on-Wheels programme, which provides cooked meal deliveries to eligible clients who are unable to buy and prepare their own meals.The community plays a strong role in complementing the Government's efforts on food issues. MSF is aware of more than 20 registered charities and a growing number of informal groups in Singapore providing a variety of food support, including cooked meals, dry rations, and perishables, such as bread and vegetables. Apart from such charities, grassroots organisations and religious organisations such as mosques, churches and temples also provide free food to those in need. These organisations and informal groups are largely volunteer-driven and collaborate closely with community agencies such as Family Service Centres in their food collection and distribution. These community efforts provide support for households to meet their food-related needs, while contributing to food sustainability and reduced food wastage in Singapore. Such collaborations are good examples of the impact the community can make and how the community can partner with the Government to support those in need. "
update on commercial for-profit surrogacy and deterrent measures in place,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Social and Family Development whether he can provide an update on the Ministry's position on commercial for-profit surrogacy and whether measures will be put in place to deter it.,"Mr Desmond Lee: Currently, Assisted Reproduction Technology (ART) centres in Singapore are not allowed to provide surrogacy treatment. We are still carefully reviewing our position on surrogacy, bearing in mind the following considerations.Surrogacy is a complex issue with several ethical, social, health and legal implications. Singapore's public policy encourages parenthood within marriage. Consistent with this, we will generally not object if married couples with fertility problems apply to the Singapore Court to adopt their children born through surrogacy that is carried out overseas. This is provided they are medically assessed to be unable to conceive children, and that the surrogacy arrangement is carried out in a jurisdiction where surrogacy is not illegal or unlawful.The Government does not encourage planned and deliberate single parenthood as a lifestyle choice. Hence, as a matter of public policy, we do not support the use of Assisted Reproduction Technology (ART) or surrogacy by singles to conceive children and adopt them. We also do not support the formation of same-sex families through adoption.All adoption applications will continue to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Besides factors concerning the child's well-being, such as parenting practices, family circumstances and available support networks, the circumstances surrounding each application must also be taken into account to ensure that the adoption does not go against public policy. It should thus not be taken as a matter of course that applications to adopt children born overseas and outside of wedlock would be successful."
average number of referrals made by silver generation office to healthcare and social service providers,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Health (a) to date, what is the total number and average number of referrals made by the Silver Generation Office (SGO) to healthcare and social service providers; and (b) how many SGO home visits resulted in applications being filed respectively for (i) Interim Disability Assistance Scheme for the Elderly (IDAPE) (ii) Pioneer Generation Disability Assistance Scheme (PioneerDAS) (iii) Seniors' Mobility and Enabling Fund (SMF) (iv) Enhancement for Active Seniors (EASE); (v) Caregivers Training Grant (CTG) (vi) Medifund (vii) ComCare and (viii) Community Health Assistance Scheme (CHAS).","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Following home visits, Silver Generation Ambassadors (SGAs) or Officers may make recommendations to seniors to apply for healthcare and social support schemes or referrals to providers of other healthcare or social services that meet the seniors' needs. For engagements by SGAs between 1 March 2019 and 31 July 2019, the number of applications for different support schemes and referrals to other service providers subsequently are as follows.1"
basis of hospital visitation and medical decision-making rights extended to patient's unmarried partner,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Health (a) whether, and on what basis, hospital visitation and medical decision-making rights are extended to a patient's unmarried partner; and (b) whether, and on what basis, these rights are applicable to unmarried partners of the same sex.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Hospital visitation by relatives and friends are allowed, subject to considerations such as the patient's medical condition, visiting hours and restrictions on number of visitors at bedside to minimise disruptions. Where the patient has mental capacity, decisions on his healthcare and treatment plans rests with the patient himself. Under the Mental Capacity Act (MCA), individuals can make a Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) to appoint anyone they trust as their donees, to make decisions relating to their personal welfare, in the event that they lose mental capacity. Such donees can make decisions relating to the individuals' healthcare and treatment, such as hospital visitation, but excludes certain key medical decisions, such as sterilisation and continuation or cessation of life-sustaining treatments. A deputy may also be appointed by the court under MCA to make certain decisions on behalf of an individual who lacks mental capacity, when the individual has not made a LPA, and has no donee to make decisions on his behalf.   In the absence of a donee or deputy, the doctor-in-charge would usually make decisions based on the best interests of patients under their care, but the court may have to make these decisions, if there is an unresolved conflict over what the best interests of the patients are."
schemes to ensure affordable step-down care and nursing home facilities for ageing population,"Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Health whether there are any schemes available to ensure affordable step-down care and nursing home facilities for our ageing population and, if not, whether the Ministry will consider schemes to make such facilities accessible and affordable to Singaporeans.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: To ensure affordability of intermediate and long term care (ILTC) services, the Government provides multiple layers of support to help Singaporeans. The Government provides means-tested subsidies of up to 80% for ILTC services. More subsidies are directed towards the lower-income, where needs are greater.We will be introducing several new schemes to further support Singaporeans' long-term care needs. By end 2019, the Home Caregiving Grant will be implemented to help with costs of long-term caregiving in the community. In 2020, we will introduce CareShield Life, a new long-term care insurance scheme that provides monthly cash payouts for those who are severely disabled. We will also implement ElderFund, a discretionary financial assistance scheme for low-income, severely disabled Singaporeans. To complement these, we will allow MediSave cash withdrawals for Singaporeans' long-term care needs.Finally, Singaporeans who have care needs but are unable to afford it despite all other available support measures can apply for MediFund assistance at subsidised long-term care providers."
home visits by silver general office ambassadors,Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the average number of home visits conducted by each Silver Generation Office (SGO) ambassador; (b) what is the ratio between SGO ambassadors and households; (c) what is the average time period between home visits by SGO ambassadors for households requiring follow-ups and for households not requiring follow-ups respectively; and (d) what is the total amount of money spent to make possible the home visits conducted by SGO ambassadors.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Home visits are primarily carried out by around 3,000 Silver Generation Ambassadors (SGAs), who are volunteers. On average, each SGA conducts 85 engagements per year. SGAs typically engage seniors at least once every 18 months. For seniors with more complex needs, the visits would usually be more frequent and some of these visits would be made by SGO staff rather than SGAs. SGO staff would work with community providers to develop an integrated and holistic package of support for the seniors.  SGAs are given an allowance of $10 per senior engaged."
utilisation rate of government-paid childcare leave by eligible employees,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Social and Family Development in each of the last three years, what is the utilisation rate of Government-Paid Childcare Leave among eligible employees, disaggregated by age group and gender.","Mr Desmond Lee: Working parents with citizen children below seven years of age are provided with six days of paid childcare leave. Employers absorb the cost for the first to third days, and the Government reimburses employers for the fourth to sixth days under the Government-Paid Childcare Leave (GPCL) scheme.The estimated utilisation rates of GPCL among eligible working mothers and fathers, disaggregated by age group, for each of the last three years are in Tables 1 and 2 below. This data reflects eligible working parents who took at least four days of childcare leave, but does not include those whose employers do not submit claims for the fourth to sixth day of GPCL. These numbers do not reflect those who took one to three days of childcare leave only."
take-up rate of parent-care leave by public servants,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Social and Family Development for 2017 and 2018 (a) what is the take-up rate of parent-care leave by public servants; and (b) what is the number and percentage of private companies that currently offer parent-care leave.,"Mr Desmond Lee: Civil servants are eligible for up to two days of parent-care leave per year, and they have the flexibility to take this leave in full or half day blocks. In 2017 and 2018, the percentage of eligible officers who took up parent-care leave was 43% and 44% respectively. More companies have offered paid parent-care leave over time. From an MOM survey, 20% of companies in the private sector offered such leave benefits in 2018, up from 15% in 2012.  To further support employees with unexpected care needs, the tripartite partners have also encouraged more employers to adopt the Tripartite Standard on Unpaid Leave for Unexpected Care Needs, regardless of whether they already provide parent-care leave. Today, 700 companies employing about 250,000 workers have adopted this Standard. Care-givers have given feedback to the Government that they prefer flexible work arrangements (FWAs) over parental leave, as a more sustainable way to balance work and care-giving responsibilities. Arrangements such as telecommuting or flexible working hours provide caregivers with greater flexibility if they need to take some time away from work for ad hoc parental care duties.Employees have greater access to FWAs today. More than nine in 10 employees today work in companies that provide some form of work flexibility. Among those who needed FWAs, more than eight in 10 employees had access to the FWA that they needed. To encourage more companies to meet their employees' FWA needs, MOM increased the Work-Life Grant budget from $30 million to $100 million in July 2019. This scheme allows each company to receive up to $105,000 over two years, to help the company maintain their employees' FWAs on a regular basis, whether it is flexi-time, flexi-load or flexi-place. MOM and the tripartite partners will also continue to actively promote the Tripartite Standard on FWAs."
audit of insurance companies' coverage of employees with disabilities,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Ministry can commission an audit of all insurance companies to ensure (i) they approve the applications of workmen's compensation insurance coverage for employees with disabilities and (ii) all employees with disabilities are covered for workmen's compensation.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: All employees, including those with disabilities, are covered by the Work Injury Compensation Act (WICA) and can receive work injury compensation from their employers if they suffer an injury arising out of and in the course of work.  We do not condone selective coverage or cherry-picking of employees based on their personal characteristics by insurers. With the new WICA 2019, insurers offering WICA policies must be licensed by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM). The licensing conditions will prohibit designated insurers from refusing to cover certain group of employees based on personal characteristics such as disability, age, or health status. Under the new Act, designated insurers will also have access to companies' actual claim records, to help them price the premiums to reflect the risk profile of the company. In other words, there is no need for them to presume that a company hiring disabled persons will face higher WICA claims."
hiring of male domestic workers,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Manpower (a) in each year from 2013 to 2018, what is the number of male domestic workers; (b) what are the reasons cited by applicants to justify the hiring of male domestic workers; and (c) whether there are any plans to allow more men to work as domestic workers and, if so, what are the reasons.","Mrs Josephine Teo: In each of the five years from 2013 to 2018, there were about 50 male foreign domestic workers (FDWs) in Singapore. The main reason cited when applying to hire a male FDW is that a female FDW is not suitable for the family's care-giving needs. Examples are where the family member to be cared for has a disability, is of heavy build and/or has a special medical condition.   The vast majority of employers prefer to hire female FDWs. The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) will continue to assess applications for male FDWs on a case-by-case basis and exercise flexibility in exceptional situations."
care-givers usage of care-givers' training grant,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Health for each year from 2013 to 2018 (a) what is the number of care-givers broken down by caregiver type, such as family member or domestic worker, who have used the Care-givers' Training Grant; and (b) which is the most popular care-giving course.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: From 2013 to 2018, the number of unique caregivers1 who utilised the Care-givers Training Grant (CTG), and their profile are as follows: The care-giving courses that are most frequently taken up under the CTG are eldercare courses, such as those equipping caregivers to assist those who need help with Activities of Daily Living, and to care for seniors with dementia. "
measures to reduce overly conservative budgeting,Mr Leon Perera asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance whether measures are being adopted to reduce instances of overly conservative budgeting or budgeting approaches which tend to under-state the eventual real surplus on Government accounts.,"Mr Heng Swee Keat: The Ministry of Finance takes budget marksmanship seriously as part of its work in ensuring sound financial management. The accuracy of budgeted estimates for Operating Revenue (excluding Net Investment Returns Contribution) and Government Expenditure (excluding Special Transfers) is tracked as part of the Ministry of Finance's Key Performance Indicators, published in the annual Budget documents.Overall, the variances of our projections have been within a reasonable range. From FY2014 to FY2018 (revised), the average variance between our eventual outturns and forecasts was under 3% for revenues, and under 2% for expenditures. These are comparable to those in Hong Kong, Korea and New Zealand, where average revenue and expenditure forecast variances range from 2% to 6% and 1% to 3% respectively for the same period. Forecasting is an inherently uncertain exercise, in particular for a small and open economy like Singapore. The more significant differences from our past projections have tended to be driven by revenues that are influenced by economic volatility and market sentiments. In FY2017, for example, there was an exceptionally high Statutory Board Contribution from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) (+$4.6 billion) and Stamp Duty (+$2.2 billion). The former was driven by unexpected investment gains from a global rally in equity and bond markets. The latter was the result of an unexpected pick-up in property market transactions. When there were unexpected surpluses, we have deployed them for the public good, saving them for anticipated spending needs and sharing some of the surpluses with Singaporeans. For example, arising from the unexpected surplus from FY2017, we set aside funds in a Rail Infrastructure Fund to support plans for future MRT development. We also announced a one-off $700 million SG Bonus to share the surpluses with Singaporeans. Our approach to budgeting is a prudent and citizen-centric one. We plan for sufficient revenues to meet the needs of our people across each term of Government. Any surpluses are invested to yield long-term returns. Up to half of these returns on our net assets are then channeled into future budgets to meet growing needs in areas from education to healthcare, support for our seniors, and keeping our home safe and secure."
plans to improve regulation regime of credit rating agencies in singapore to eu equivalent status,Mr Leon Perera asked the Prime Minister whether there are plans to improve the regulation regime of credit rating agencies in Singapore to re-achieve equivalence status with the regulation regime of the European Union.,"Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): Some media reports might have given the impression that the European Commission (EC) is reducing its market access to financial institutions in Singapore. This is not true. There continues to be no impediment, for financial services provided out of Singapore to customers in the European Union (EU). There has also been no impact on investors' confidence in Singapore. Let me explain. The EC's decision covers only Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) and does not extend to any other financial services. Further, the EC recognises CRAs in a third country through two approaches: First, deeming the third country's CRA rules as equivalent to EC rules. This is called the equivalence decision; Second, an endorsement approach, where the CRAs in the third country rely on their related entities in the EU to endorse their ratings. CRAs in Singapore have been using the endorsement approach, and the EC has confirmed that it will continue to recognise Singapore-based CRAs using this approach.    Having said that, equivalence is the highest form of market integration, which CRAs in Singapore, like those in several other jurisdictions, no longer enjoy. The reason has to do with the different approaches taken by major regulators internationally.On how the Monetary Authority of Singapore's (MAS) regulations on CRAs compare to those in the EU, MAS' CRA regulatory regime is based on, and consistent with, standards promulgated by the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), which is the global standard setting body. The EC has assessed MAS' CRA regulatory regime to be less prescriptive than EU rules in certain areas, such as in defining specific situations in which a conflict of interest for the CRA arises. MAS takes a more principles-based approach. It nevertheless requires conflicts of interest to be effectively addressed, and is fully in line with international standards and appropriate to our context and needs.Singapore is in good standing with the EU. We have EC recognition on a broad range of other financial services, including for over-the-counter derivatives trading venues and central counterparties. In July 2019, we were one of the first two jurisdictions to obtain EC equivalence for financial benchmarks regulation. MAS will continue to closely engage our EU counterparts in reviewing our rules to ensure that financial institutions in Singapore continue to have access to the EU market in various financial services."
rationale for reduction in childcare leave when child turns seven years old,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Prime Minister what is the rationale for reducing the amount of childcare leave from six days to only two days when the child turns seven years old.,"Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): Under the Child Development Co-Savings Act, parents of Singaporean children are provided with six days of paid childcare leave per year until their child turns seven years old. Childcare leave provisions have been enhanced progressively over the years. In 2008, childcare leave provisions for parents with children aged below seven years old were raised from two to six days. In 2013, two days of childcare leave were also extended to parents with children aged seven to 12, recognising that parents with children in primary school would also need time to tend to their children's needs. More days of childcare leave are granted to parents of younger children in the earlier years of their development as they require relatively more care from parents, compared to children in primary school. We have taken a practical approach to calibrating the childcare leave provisions for parents with young children, balancing the caregiving needs of parents with the manpower and operational needs of employers. We will continue to study how to better support working parents, including partnering Singaporeans through the Citizens' Panel that will convene next month, to identify new ways to address work-life harmony issues."
granting of long term visit pass/long term visit pass-plus to single non-singaporean mothers of singapore citizen children under age 21,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether divorced, widowed or separated non-Singaporean mothers of Singapore Citizen children under the age of 21 can be automatically granted a Long Term Visit Pass/Long Term Visit Pass-Plus if they fulfil certain background conditions; and (b) if so, whether the Ministry can make public this list of conditions for the automatic grant so as to assure such mothers and their children of a stable family life.",Mr K Shanmugam: Divorced or widowed foreign mothers who have custody of their minor Singaporean children would generally be able to qualify for a Long-Term Visit Pass (LTVP) or Long-Term Visit Pass-Plus (LTVP+). The LTVP or LTVP+ will facilitate their continued stay in Singapore to care for their children. Each application for LTVP/LTVP+ is assessed carefully taking into consideration the circumstances of each case and other relevant factors such as whether the applicant has adverse records. The vast majority of such foreign mothers have been granted long-term stay in Singapore.  
overstayers arrested in 2018,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Home Affairs of the 940 overstayers arrested in 2018, what is (i) the number of Social Visit Pass overstayers and Work Pass overstayers respectively and (ii) the duration of overstaying for the 20th percentile, 50th percentile and the 80th percentile.","Mr K Shanmugam: The number of overstayers arrested in Singapore has decreased from 1,690 in 2013 to 940 in 2018. Of these 940 overstayers, 510 were Short-Term Visit Pass holders, and 107 were Work Pass holders. Another 283 were holders of Special Passes, which were issued to them for specific purposes such as assisting in an investigation or attending court. The remaining overstayers held other passes, for example, Long-Term Visit Pass and Student's Pass. The median overstay duration is about two months.ICA will continue to maintain its enforcement efforts to ensure that the overstayers situation is kept under control. "
amount of food waste generated in singapore,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources in 2017 and 2018, what is the total amount of food waste generated in Singapore by (i) all the hawker centres (ii) all the hotels (iii) all the caterers (iv) all the meat importers and distributors and (v) all the pre-packed food manufacturers.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: In 2017 and 2018, approximately 810,000 tonnes and 763,000 tonnes of food waste was generated respectively. Of this, about half was from residential households. The remainder was from other sources, which includes food manufacturers, importers and distributors, caterers, hotels, and hawker centres. The National Environment Agency (NEA) does not track the specific amount of food waste generated from individual source categories.  "
provision of sensitivity training to police and other first responders to victims of violence,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether sensitivity training is provided to the police and other first responders to facilitate responding to victims of violence in connection with sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, including LGBTQ victims of family violence and intimate partner violence; and (b) how such training is conducted, if applicable.","Mr K Shanmugam: Police officers are trained to be sensitive to the needs of all victims, including those from the LGBTQ community. The training covers a wide range of issues, including the causes of victim trauma, the needs of victims, the vulnerabilities faced by victims, and victim management. "
measures taken by mas in view of imf's financial sector assessment programme findings for singapore,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Prime Minister in view of the findings in IMF's Financial Sector Assessment Programme for Singapore, what resources and preparation are being applied by the MAS division that supervises payment systems to manage the broad scope of supervisory duties that it undertakes.","Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): The International Monetary Fund (IMF), in its recent assessment of the Singapore's financial system under its Financial Sector Assessment Programme, reaffirmed Singapore's financial sector oversight to be ""among the best globally"".  Specifically, it concluded that the Monetary Authority of Singapore's (MAS) supervision of payment systems, namely – MAS Electronic Payment System (MEPS+), Fast And Secure Transfers (FAST), Inter-bank GIRO, Singapore Dollar Cheque Clearing, and the NETS Electronic Funds Transfer at Point of Sale (EFTPOS) – was in line with international standards, and appropriate and effective.Notwithstanding, in anticipation of evolving systemic risks in the payments landscape, the IMF had recommended that MAS increase its resources for the supervision of payment systems. MAS' thinking is the same as the IMF's on this matter. MAS has indeed been allocating additional resources for supervision of payment activities and implementing enhancements to its supervisory programme. These include leveraging data analytics capabilities, and applying appropriate standards to retail payment systems in line with their changing systemic importance. MAS will continue to watch developments in the payments landscape and ensure its capabilities and supervisory approaches are appropriate."
creating honorary citizenship for those who have invested in singapore and created quality jobs for singaporeans,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Prime Minister whether the Government will consider creating honorary citizenships (without benefits and grants/subsidies that Singaporeans are entitled to) for those who have invested in Singapore and created quality jobs for Singaporeans.,"Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): The Government already confers the Honorary Citizen Award to recognise foreigners who have contributed extensively and significantly to Singapore and its people. Honorary Citizens must be individuals who have a strong affinity towards Singapore, and are highly respected for their professional accomplishments. This is the highest form of national recognition for a foreigner. Honorary Citizens are accorded privileges, such as the right to reside and work in Singapore. However, they do not receive grants and subsidies that Singaporeans are entitled to. Since 2003, 21 individuals have received this national award."
update on early stage venture fund initiative,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Prime Minister (a) whether he can provide an update on the Early Stage Venture Fund initiative which started in 2008; and (b) how successful has the initiative been in helping to incubate and grow enterprises since its inception.,"Mr Heng Swee Keat (for the Prime Minister): Startups are an important catalyst and driver of innovation and enterprise in our economy. The Government has put in place a range of schemes to catalyse funding into Singapore startups across different stages of their development.One such scheme is the Early Stage Venture Fund (ESVF), which aims to catalyse venture capital (VC) funding for early-stage Singapore-based high-tech startups. The scheme has evolved over the past decade in line with the needs of our startups, as our eco-system developed. The scheme catalysed the formation of 10 early-stage venture capital (VC) funds and four Corporate Venture Funds, and has invested in more than 60 Singapore-based high-technology startups  More recently, the ESVF scheme supported the formation of the National Research Foundation Singapore (NRF)-Temasek IP Commercialisation Vehicle, announced at Budget 2018, to co-invest in startups underpinned by intellectual property generated from publicly-funded Research and Development (R&D). Of the startups that received investments catalysed by ESVF, about two-thirds have progressed significantly, in that they have either crossed $250,000 in revenue, raised more than $250,000 in third party investments, or increased their valuation by at least 20%.  Aslan Pharmaceuticals and De.Mem are two such startups which have benefitted from the ESVF scheme: (a) Aslan Pharmaceuticals is a biotechnology company that develops therapies for cancer tumour types prevalent in Asia. Having received more than $4 million in investments catalysed by ESVF, it has listed on both the Taipei Exchange and NASDAQ, raising more than US$75 million in the process. Aslan is headquartered in Singapore, with offices in Taiwan and Shanghai. (b) De.Mem is a company providing solutions for drinking water generation, municipal sewage treatment and industrial wastewater treatment in decentralised applications. It is a spin-off from the Nanyang Environment and Water Research Institute (NEWRI) at NTU, having licensed Forward Osmosis and Nanofiltration membrane technologies from NEWRI. De.Mem, which had received around $3.5 million in investments catalysed by ESVF, has now achieved a S$25 million (A$27 million) market capitalisation and has operations in Singapore, Australia and Vietnam. Besides the ESVF, NRF has also co-invested in high-technology startups since 2008 through two other schemes – the Technology Incubation Scheme (TIS) in partnership with startup incubators, and the Distruptive Incubator Scheme (DIS), which operated as an incubator investment fund. Then-SPRING also invested in startups through the SEEDS Capital, which was started in 2001. Collectively, these schemes have made investments into more than 400 startups. Beyond funding support, the Government has taken other steps to grow a conducive environment for startups. Startup SG, administered by Enterprise Singapore, has consolidated all the startup-facing support from the Government into a one-stop shop. This includes providing startups with access to mentorship, talent, local and global networks, co-innovation platforms and infrastructure, in order to build their capabilities and grow. Through these efforts, Singapore's startup ecosystem is becoming more vibrant. We have seen positive growth in the local tech startup eco-system. A decade ago, less than 70 VC investments were closed in Singapore in a year. This has grown to more than 350 last year. The Government will continue to grow an enabling, pro-enterprise environment for startups.  "
monitoring of shared personal mobility devices deployment,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Transport (a) how will LTA monitor whether shared personal mobility devices (PMDs) that are deployed on private land end up entering public spaces and the effects arising thereof; (b) how will LTA detect the illegal deployment of shared PMDs for hire at public places and what are the penalties for this offence; and (c) whether shared-PMD companies are required to submit their plans for deploying their fleet at private premises to LTA.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Under the Parking Places Act, operators are required to obtain a licence to offer dockless PMD-sharing services that operate in a public place. This is to prevent indiscriminate parking of shared devices. While the licensing regime does not cover PMD-sharing operators who deploy their devices solely on private land, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) engages these operators proactively to understand their deployment plans and advise them on our regulations. LTA's enforcement officers conduct regular patrols based on these plans and at known hotspots to detect illegal deployment. Operators who operate illegally without a licence may be fined up to $10,000 and/or be imprisoned for up to six months. LTA will also impound shared PMDs that are illegally deployed, and take all contraventions into account if the operator decides to apply for a device-sharing licence.All device-sharing operators, regardless of whether they operate on public or private land, must do their part to ensure users ride safely and park properly. We are also considering additional regulations to ensure that all shared devices are used safely, and will continue to monitor this space closely."
top three causes of mrt train delays not more than five minutes in past three years,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Transport (a) in the past three years, what are the top three causes for the incidences of MRT train delays of not more than five minutes; (b) what measures have been put in place to prevent or minimise such delays; and (c) whether LTA has set any goals for the MRT operators to prevent or minimise such delays and, if so, what are the goals set.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The top three causes of minor MRT delays are passenger actions, train faults and signalling system faults.Such delays are monitored and addressed by the rail operators and the Land Transport Authority (LTA) through identifying their root causes and remedial measures, including timely renewal of ageing assets. LTA is also working with the rail operators to install more condition monitoring devices to support the early detection and pre-emptive rectification of faults.Our priority is to closely monitor and benchmark performance against other operators using the Mean Kilometres Between Failure (MKBF) metric, an internationally recognised measure of rail reliability. As overall rail reliability and MKBF improves, short delays would come down too."
number of singaporeans born between 1950 and 1959 not eligible for merdeka generation package,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) what is the number of Singaporeans who are born between 1950 and 1959 but are not eligible for the Merdeka Generation Package (MGP); (b) what is the number of such Singaporeans who have appealed to be included in the MGP; and (c) what is the number of such appeals that have been successful to date.,"Mr Heng Swee Keat: In terms of the age criteria, the Merdeka Generation Package (MGP) applies to Singaporeans born from 1950 to 1959, as well as those born in 1949 or earlier and who did not receive the Pioneer Generation Package. Among them, there are about 16,000 who did not meet the citizenship criteria because they became citizens after 1996.As of end-July 2019, there were close to 400 citizenship-related appeals, and the Appeals Panel has reviewed about half of them. We are working with the remaining appellants to obtain more information in order to better understand their circumstances. Close to 120 appeals (or about 60% of the cases reviewed) have been successful. These are Singaporeans who have just missed the citizenship cut-off, but have good grounds to be counted among the Merdeka Generation."
frequency of platform screen door faults in mrt stations between 2015 and 2019,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Transport (a) for each year from 2015 to 2019, what has been the frequency of platform screen door faults in MRT stations for both below and above ground stations; (b) how frequently are the screen doors serviced; and (c) how long are the screen doors expected to last before replacements are due.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: From 2015 to 2017, there were 10 Platform Screen Door (PSD) faults causing delays of more than five minutes. In the past 19 months till July 2019, there were no such PSD incidents.The rail operators have a monthly preventive maintenance regime for PSDs. This includes component inspections or functional tests on the different mechanical, electrical and pneumatic systems. Servicing and component replacement are done when required.PSDs are replaced when they become unreliable or more difficult to maintain. They can be used for many years as long as their mechanisms are well maintained."
conditions or circumstances to allow requests to view traffic accident footage,"Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) under what pre-conditions or circumstances will the Traffic Police show traffic accident footage from CCTV cameras to victims, their next-of-kin, potential claimants or potential offenders; and (b) at which stage of investigations or proceedings will requests to view such footage be considered or acceded to.","Mr K Shanmugam: CCTV footages of traffic accidents are part of the evidence of investigations and criminal proceedings. Police therefore do not generally share such footages with victims, their next-of-kin, potential claimants or alleged offenders while investigations are ongoing. A witness may tailor his evidence after seeing what is captured in the footages, resulting in inaccurate gathering of information regarding the accident. Should the alleged offender be charged in Court, the defence will generally be able to view such footages on request. The footages, however, are generally not shared with victims, their next-of-kin, and potential claimants while criminal proceedings are ongoing.  Upon conclusion of the criminal proceedings, evidence tendered in court will generally be on public record and a person who needs to have access to them may apply to the Court. "
extension of retirement and re-employment ages and plans to review retirement and re-employment ages for officers under uniformed services schemes,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Home Affairs in view of the impending extension of the retirement and re-employment ages (a) how many civilian officers in the Ministry will benefit from this extension; and (b) whether there are plans to review the retirement and re-employment ages for officers under the uniformed services schemes.,"Mr K Shanmugam: There are about 3,800 civilian officers in the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), and 5,200 officers under the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority scheme of service, whose retirement and re-employment ages follow the national framework.  As for Home Affairs uniformed officers, MHA last increased their retirement age from 50 to 55 in 2013. MHA periodically reviews it to ensure that we are able to meet the manpower requirements of the Home Team, taking into consideration changes in life expectancy and years of healthy living, as well as the ability and desire of our officers to work longer. MHA is in the midst of such a review, which will be completed in the next several months."
bus shelter advertisement boards causing blind spots leading to accidents between pedestrians and personal mobility device users or cyclists,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Transport whether bus shelter advertisement boards placed perpendicular to roads are causing blind spots leading to accidents between pedestrian commuters and personal mobility device (PMD) users or cyclists.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The Land Transport Authority (LTA) does consider the safety factor when placing advertisement panels at bus stops. The panels should not obstruct the views of bus commuters, path and road users.  In any case, cyclists and personal mobility device users should go behind the bus stop where possible, instead of riding through the bus stop. LTA is progressively building cycling paths and widening footpaths behind bus stops with high commuter traffic. LTA will continue to highlight safe riding practices, such as ""slow down when approaching bus stops"" in its public education campaigns. "
number of lifts built at pedestrian overhead bridges near mrt stations,"Mr Ang Wei Neng asked the Minister for Transport (a) of the lifts that have been built at pedestrian overhead bridges (POBs), how many are near to an MRT station; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider building a lift at the POB near Block 350 Jurong East Avenue 1.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: To date, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) has installed lifts at 47 pedestrian overhead bridges (POBs). Twenty out of these 47 POBs are located near major MRT stations. The remaining POBs with lifts are located near amenities, such as bus interchanges and healthcare institutions. The lift retrofitting programme will be expanded to around 50 more POBs, including the POB near Block 350, Jurong East Avenue 1."
number of people using medisave to pay for parents' healthcare cost in past five years,Mr Chen Show Mao asked the Minister for Health for each year in the past five years (a) what is the number of people using MediSave to pay for their parents' healthcare cost; and (b) what is the median withdrawal value.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Over the past five years, about 6% of all MediSave withdrawals were for the MediSave account holder's parents' healthcare expenses, which include inpatient, day surgery and outpatient expenses. The details are in Table 1 below. "
number of personal protection order applications rejected from 2015 to 2018,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Law (a) for each year from 2015 to 2018, how many applications for Personal Protection Orders have been rejected by the Family Justice Courts; and (b) what are the main reasons for rejection.","Mr K Shanmugam: Applications for Personal Protection Orders (PPOs) can either be rejected at the point the complaint is made or at the conclusion of a hearing.  A very small fraction of applications for PPOs is rejected at the point the complaint is made. Generally, these applications are rejected if the allegation(s) averred are, on the face of the complaint, insufficient to satisfy the definition of ""family violence"" under s 64 of the Women's Charter. The vast majority of applications for PPOs proceed for a hearing. Whether the application for a PPO is granted or not depends on the facts of each case. An application for a PPO may, for example, be dismissed if the respondent shows that the force used was lawfully used in self-defence. Applications for a PPO may also be dismissed if the court is not satisfied that a PPO is necessary for the protection or personal safety of the applicant.The statistics are as follows: "
illegal short-term rental of private properties in last five years,"Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for National Development regarding illegal short-term rental of private properties in each of the last five years (a) what is the number of owners who have been issued warnings and charged respectively; (b) what is the profile of these owners in terms of their age groups, nationalities and number of properties owned; and (c) what is the number of recalcitrant property owners.","Mr Lawrence Wong: In the past five years, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) investigated an average of about 600 suspected cases of illegal short-term accommodation (STA) per year. Where an offence was established, URA has taken appropriate action against the perpetrators. These offenders include both property owners and tenants. They come from a wide range of age groups, and are mostly Singaporeans. URA has found that while some offenders are responsible for a large number of STA listings, they typically do not own those properties, but instead rent from the owners and then sublet them illegally to short-term occupants. For such cases, property owners will also be held liable for the infringements occurring in their properties, even if the offending use was carried out by the tenant. For those renting out homes on a casual basis, and caught for the first time, URA will impose a composition fine, of up to $5,000. Since May 2019, URA has issued 14 composition fines. For recalcitrant offenders and those who undertake STA operations on a commercial basis, URA will prosecute them in Court and seek significantly higher penalties. To date, URA has charged 10 such individuals, comprising a mix of Singaporeans and foreigners on work passes. Four of them have been fined between $13,000 and $70,000 by the Court. The remaining six individuals together face a total of more than 80 charges, and their cases are currently before the Court. URA will continue to step up its investigations and enforcement efforts."
"applications for hdb bto flats and executive condominiums rejected in last three years due to $10,000 and $12,000 income ceilings","Mr Ang Wei Neng asked the Minister for National Development (a) in the past three years, how many applications for HDB BTO flats and executive condominiums have been rejected due to failure to meet the $10,000 and $12,000 income ceilings respectively; and (b) whether HDB is prepared to increase the respective income ceilings.","Mr Lawrence Wong: The Housing and Development Board (HDB) is committed to helping Singaporeans, particularly first-timers and lower to middle-income families, own a home. The income ceiling helps to ensure that housing subsidies are prioritised for those who need them most.  At the current income ceiling of $12,000, about eight in 10 Singaporeans are able to buy a subsidised flat. Households earning up to $14,000 may buy an Executive Condominium (EC) unit from property developers. There is no income ceiling restriction for the purchase of a resale HDB flat on the open market.From 2016 to 2018, HDB turned down an average of about 360 applications per year for new flats and ECs due to the income ceilings.We will continue to review our public housing policies to ensure that they remain relevant. "
exemption of bankrupt persons' income from creditors' claims for use in insurance premium payments for home protection and cpf insurance schemes,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Law whether the income of bankrupt persons can be exempt from creditors' claims and be used in priority for the payment of insurance premiums such as that of HDB's Home Protection Scheme and all CPF insurance schemes to protect the bankrupt and his family.,"Mr K Shanmugam: After a Bankruptcy Order is made, a bankrupt has to make monthly contributions to his bankruptcy estate during the period of the bankruptcy. The bankruptcy estate will then be distributed to the creditor(s) upon the bankrupt's discharge.In determining the monthly contribution, the Official Assignee (OA) or the Private Trustees-in-Bankruptcy take into consideration the bankrupt's current income, relevant work experience and age, as well as reasonable expenses which the bankrupt and his family may incur. In general, a monthly personal deductible of $1,100 is allowed, and additional deductibles may be allowed depending on the bankrupt's specific circumstances. These deductibles can be used to pay for the insurance premiums for the Home Protection Scheme and other CPF insurance schemes so as to protect the bankrupt and his family. Where allowed by CPF rules, CPF members can also use their CPF contributions and savings to pay for these insurance premiums."
policies on permanent residents owning landed residential property in singapore,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for Law (a) what are the policies on permanent residents owning landed residential property in Singapore; and (b) whether there is any upper limit on the size of the land that they can own for such landed residential property.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The Government takes a strict approach towards ownership of landed residential property in Singapore by foreigners, including Permanent Residents, to ensure that they remain the primary preserve of Singapore Citizens, given their scarcity.   Foreign ownership of landed residential properties in Singapore is restricted under the Residential Property Act (RPA) and foreigners who wish to purchase such properties must seek the approval of the Minister for Law.  Applicants are assessed on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration factors such as their economic contribution to Singapore. Foreigners that are granted approval are allowed to own only one landed residential property, and the property must be used for their own occupation.There are more stringent qualifying criteria for landed residential properties that are larger than 15,000 square feet, and those situated within a good class bungalow area. "
number of nurses resigned in past 10 years,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Health (a) how many Singaporean nurses have resigned in the past 10 years; (b) what are the top three reasons underlying this group of nurses leaving service; and (c) how many Singaporean nurses retire annually in the past 10 years.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Based on available data from 2013 to 20181, an average of about 850 local nurses resigned from the public healthcare sector each year. The average resignation rate for this period was 6.0%.Over the same period, around 0.1% or 20 local nurses retired each year. The most common reasons cited by local nurses when they left the public healthcare sector include family commitment, further studies on their own accord and desire for a change in work environment."
strategic plans for singapore's national football team to qualify for fifa world cup in 2034,"Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth what are the strategic plans of the Football Association of Singapore (FAS) to achieve its goal for Singapore's national football team to qualify for the FIFA World Cup in 2034.","Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: The Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth welcomes our Team Singapore athletes and sports associations to strive for excellence, and supports them in realising their goals.  We look forward to hearing from the FAS on their plan to achieving their stated goal, and how the football fraternity, community and the Government can support them in their efforts. "
percentage of first-owner households eligible for hdb's home improvement programme,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for National Development what percentage of households that are eligible for HDB's Home Improvement Programme are owned and lived in by Singaporeans who are their first owners.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The Home Improvement Programme was recently extended to flats built between 1987 to 1997. Currently, about 40% of these flats are owned by Singapore citizens who are the first owners."
training participation rate of unemployed persons and their utilisation of skillsfuture credits in last three years,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Manpower in each of the last three years (a) what is the training participation rate of unemployed persons, broken down by gender; and (b) what is the utilisation rate of SkillsFuture credits amongst unemployed persons, broken down by gender.","Mrs Josephine Teo: The breakdown of training participation rates of unemployed persons by gender, in each of the last three years, is provided in Table 1. The training participation rate of unemployed males increased significantly from 2016 to 2017, but dipped slightly in 2018. The training participation rate of unemployed females has steadily increased from 2016 to 2018. We do not have the breakdown of utilisation rate of SkillsFuture Credit by employment status. Since the roll-out of the SkillsFuture Credit in January 2016, its utilisation between genders has been relatively balanced. "
operating expenditures of libraries in autonomous universities and polytechnics in last three years,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Education for each of the last three years, what are the operating expenditures of the libraries of each of the Autonomous Universities and Polytechnics, broken down by (i) electronic database/electronic journal subscription costs (ii) physical book/journal/media acquisition costs and (iii) staff/administration costs.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: The expenditure on libraries varies across Institutes of Higher Learning (IHL), depending on the volume and type of research they undertake, the range of academic disciplines they offer, the size of the student and faculty body, and other factors. Over the past few years, operating expenditure on libraries ranged between $1 million to $6 million per year, across each Polytechnic. For the Autonomous Universities (AU), their library expenditures ranged from $1 million to $32 million per year. This works out to be between one percent to four percent of the total operating expenditure for each of the IHLs. Table 1 shows the breakdown of the library operating expenditures for AUs and Polytechnics. The IHLs have put in place measures to share resources across institutions through inter-library loans, so that students can have access to more library materials than those in their own institutions. For example, the AU libraries are studying the possibility of joint subscription of e-resources. The IHLs will continue to work together to enhance such efforts."
measures taken to minimise impact of recent indonesian forest fires,"Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources in view of the recent Indonesian forest fires, what measures are being taken to minimise the impact on Singapore and what is the update on the cooperative actions with neighbouring countries under the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution (AATHP).","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The Government adopts a multi-pronged approach to reduce the risk and impact of transboundary haze on Singapore. In Singapore, the National Environment Agency (NEA) continuously monitors the ambient air quality and has been issuing daily advisories to the public on the haze situation since 4 August this year. NEA also chairs an inter-agency Haze Task Force to monitor the haze situation closely during dry seasons and to implement action plans to mitigate the effects of haze should Singapore be affected.  Within the region, Singapore works closely with other ASEAN member states to monitor hotspot activities and undertake measures to reduce forest fires. The ASEAN Specialised Meteorological Centre (ASMC), which Singapore hosts, shares meteorological and hotspots forecasts with ASEAN member states. ASMC has also set aside $5 million over the next five years to help ASEAN member states. In addition, the lack of haze in Singapore over the last two years is in no small part due to Indonesia's extensive and continuous efforts to minimise the number of hotspots within the country.Nevertheless, we have been observing persistent hotspot activities in the surrounding region in the past few weeks. Singapore is currently in the Southwest Monsoon season and the NEA is forecasting drier conditions in the coming weeks. These conditions can lead to an escalation of hotspot activities and an increased risk of transboundary haze in Singapore and the surrounding region. At the recent 21st meeting of the Sub-Regional Ministerial Steering Committee (MSC) on Transboundary Haze Pollution in Brunei on 6 August, Singapore and other member countries (Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand) noted the report by the ASEAN Specialised Meteorological Centre about the potential escalation of hotspot activities in fire-prone areas and increased risk of transboundary haze due to drier and warmer weather. These countries also noted that transboundary haze pollution remains a major concern for the region, and reaffirmed their readiness to enhance cooperation and coordination to address land and forest fires. Singapore has offered technical firefighting assistance to Indonesia and is ready to deploy them, as we did so in 2015, if requested by Indonesia.  At the same meeting, MSC member countries also reaffirmed our commitment to the objectives and principles of the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution and the Roadmap on ASEAN Cooperation towards Transboundary Haze Pollution Control with Means of Implementation. The Roadmap serves as a strategic framework to implement collaborative actions to achieve a vision of ""Transboundary Haze-Free ASEAN by 2020"". In October 2019, Singapore will be meeting other ASEAN Member States in Cambodia to take stock of the implementation of the Agreement."
systems in place to assess indoor air quality standards in public and work places,Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether there are systems in place to assess indoor air quality standards in public places and work places; (b) whether there are measures to enforce certain standards of indoor air quality in public places and work places; and (c) what measures are in place to ensure that materials used in building construction are safe and do not contribute to indoor air pollution.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: There are measures in place to manage the indoor air quality (IAQ) in buildings. Under the Building Control Act and Regulations, building designs are required to comply with the performance requirements for fresh air intake and ventilation rate as specified in the Singapore Standard Code of Practice for Air-conditioning and Mechanical Ventilation in Buildings (SS 553). Building developers are encouraged to use green building materials, such as low emissions building products certified by the Singapore Green Building Council or Singapore Environmental Council. Indoor environmental quality and the use of green building materials are an integral part of the assessment of a building's environmental performance, to be certified under the Building and Construction Authority's (BCA) Green Mark schemes.Building owners and facility managers should also take guidance from the Singapore Standard Code of Practice for Indoor Air Quality for Air-Conditioned Buildings (SS 554), which specifies good practices in managing IAQ as well as the standards and limits of IAQ parameters. Supplementing the SS 554 are the Workplace Safety and Health Guidelines on Management of Indoor Air Quality in Air-Conditioned Workplaces published by the Workplace Safety and Health Council, which provides guidance to building owners and facility managers on the implementation of IAQ management programmes in workplaces.The National Environment Agency (NEA) conducts IAQ surveys in public places and monitors public feedback on IAQ. The surveys show that most of the causes of poor IAQ are linked to factors, such as the use of furnishings or products with high volatile organic chemicals, and inadequate design and maintenance of the building air ventilation system. Hence, NEA has been working closely with relevant agencies to conduct educational sessions on IAQ for building owners and facility managers, to highlight the importance of building ventilation maintenance and raise awareness on choosing low-emissions furnishings or products to maintain good IAQ. NEA also assists building owners and facility managers in identifying the sources or causes of indoor air pollution in their premises, and providing advice on measures to improve IAQ.Building owners, facility managers and occupants all have a role in maintaining good IAQ. Occupants can provide feedback on IAQ to building owners and facility managers to take mitigation measures. Building owners and facility managers should adopt best practices to ensure the buildings are clean and well-ventilated."
education of young persons with disabilities,Mr Chong Kee Hiong asked the Minister for Education regarding the education of young persons with disabilities (PwDs) (a) what is the current percentage of PwDs in special schools and normal schools respectively; (b) whether there have been any changes in the proportion of PwDs among our young in the last 10 years; and (c) what are the programmes to integrate young PwDs with other students in their communities.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: The Ministry of Education (MOE) takes a broader definition of students with Special Educational Needs (SEN). It includes students with learning difficulties, such as dyslexia and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, or with Autism, physical and sensory impairment, who are enrolled in mainstream schools or study in Special Education (SPED) schools like Pathlight using the national curriculum. Those with moderate-to-severe SEN are enrolled in specialised SPED schools, with more assistance and customised teaching and learning approaches. As at December 2018, there were about 32,000 students with reported SEN, with 80% in mainstream schools and 20% in SPED schools. The proportion of students with SEN has increased from about 5% in 2014 to 7% in 2018. The rise in students with SEN is a worldwide trend. Part of this is due to increased awareness and reporting, and better identification by hospitals and schools.Mainstream schools educate students on inclusivity through classroom lessons, as well as school-based programmes that build up peer support. Through these, schools emphasise the importance of values such as respect and care for others, and promote empathy and acceptance of differences. But it is not without challenges and the system is still improving.  SPED schools have established partnerships with mainstream schools to provide social mixing opportunities between the students. An example is the combined community service and co-curricular programmes for students of Bowen Secondary School and AWWA School. MOE, schools and partner organisations also work together to promote inclusivity in the arts and sports. For example, the Play Inclusive programme brought together student-athletes from several SPED and mainstream schools to share sports experiences. SPED students also participate in the National School Games, the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation and the National Day Parade.  "
average utilisation rate of flexible work arrangements by employees in last three years,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Manpower in each of the last three years, what is the average utilisation rate of flexible work arrangements (FWAs) by employees broken down by (i) whether their employer receives the Work-Life Grant and (ii) type of FWA utilised disaggregated by gender and age.","Mrs Josephine Teo: We do not collect utilisation rate of Flexible Work Arrangements (FWAs) because it does not show if employees require more FWAs or not. A low FWA utilisation rate could be due to employees not requiring FWAs at the point in time. A more useful indicator is the accessibility of FWAs for employees who need it. Among employees aged 25 to 64 who required FWAs in 2018, more than eight in 10 had access to the FWA that they needed, an increase from seven in 10 in 2016.1 The percentage is broadly similar across age and gender.  The Work-Life Grant (WLG) is only disbursed to companies after their employees have regularly utilised the FWAs. The amount disbursed depends on the number of employees who utilised the FWAs, up to $105,000 per company. We do not track the utilisation of FWAs by all employees in each company. However, as part of the WLG conditions, every beneficiary company must adopt the Tripartite Standard on FWAs, which includes informing all their employees on the types of FWAs offered and outcomes of their applications, and engaging them on alternatives if their requests cannot be granted. To provide greater support to companies to implement FWAs, the budget for the enhanced WLG was recently increased to $100 million, up from $30 million. We strongly encourage employers to tap on the grant to offer FWAs to their employees."
complaints received of pet owners not cleaning up after their pets,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) in the past year, how many complaints regarding pet owners not cleaning up after their pets have been received; (b) how many pet owners have been identified and penalised; and (c) whether there are plans to introduce more measures.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Not cleaning up after one's pet is irresponsible behaviour that dirties our environment and inconveniences others. In 2018, the National Environment Agency (NEA) received some 800 instances of feedback concerning pet owners not cleaning up after their pets in public areas. NEA has been investigating these cases and engaging with pet owners where possible. In the past few years, five enforcement actions were taken against errant pet owners.Our main approach to tackling this issue has nonetheless been to foster a culture of responsible pet ownership. To this end, the NEA and the National Parks Board (NParks) have been working hard with community leaders and Town Councils to educate pet owners accordingly at community events, school talks and roadshows. In residential estates where there are cleanliness issues, standees reminding pet owners to clean up after their pets are also placed at prominent locations. Pet owners ought to clean up after their pets in public areas. I urge all pet owners to be considerate and play their part in keeping Singapore clean."
cases dealt with by employment claims tribunal since its establishment in april 2017,"Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for Manpower regarding the cases dealt with by the Employment Claims Tribunal (ECT) since it was established in April 2017 (a) how many and what proportion of employee-claimants obtained judgments or orders for monetary payments in their favour; (b) of the cases in (a), how many involved scenarios where the employers had abided by the terms of the employment contracts but yet were ordered by the ECT to pay additional sums to the employees; and (c) of the cases in (b), what were the typical grounds that led the ECT to order the employers to pay sums over and above what was contractually agreed.","Mrs Josephine Teo: About 1,600 employees have filed salary claims at the Employment Claims Tribunals (ECT) between April 2017 when it was established and December 2018. Two-thirds of the claims filed resulted in money orders issued to employers to settle the salary claims, and the remaining were mostly withdrawn or dismissed.  The ECT does not order employers to pay sums beyond the employees' statutory or contractual entitlements. If an order has been made against the employer, it is usually due to two reasons: (a) the employer did not abide by the terms of the employment contract; or (b) the employment contract although observed, was contrary to the Employment Act. "
percentage of employers opening posb payroll account for prospective foreign workers when applying for work permits in 2018,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Manpower (a) in 2018, what is the percentage of employers who have selected the option to open a POSB Payroll Account for their prospective foreign workers when they apply for their work permits; and (b) whether the sole POSB branch at Kaki Bukit Recreation Centre is adequate to serve the banking needs of foreign workers.","Mrs Josephine Teo: In 2018, 63% of employers selected the option to open a POSB Payroll Account for their prospective foreign workers (non-domestic work permit holders) in their work permit applications. Currently, foreign workers have to visit the POSB branch at Kaki Bukit Recreation Centre to collect their bank cards. POSB is aware that more foreign workers are visiting the POSB branch at Kaki Bukit Recreation Centre, and is working with the Ministry to explore ways to reduce the need for foreign workers to visit the POSB branch. For example, POSB has plans to pilot an initiative to allow foreign workers to receive their bank cards through the mail.  "
adoption of eight tripartite standards by employers,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the current number of employers, broken down by the number of employees and industry type, who have adopted the eight Tripartite Standards, namely Age-Friendly Workplace Practices, Contracting with Self-employed Persons, Employment of Term Contract Employees, Flexible Work Arrangements, Grievance Handling, Procurement of Services from Media Freelancers, Recruitment Practices, and Unpaid Leave for Unexpected Care Needs; and (b) what plans does the Government have to encourage more widespread adoption of these Standards.","Mrs Josephine Teo: In July 2017, MOM launched the Tripartite Standards to encourage companies to adopt fair and progressive workplace practices. Employers who adopt the Tripartite Standards are publicly recognised as progressive employers. This helps them to attract and retain jobseekers and their current workers. Adoption is voluntary.  Two years on, we have seen significant progress. As of July 2019, about 2,700 employers, including public sector agencies, covering about 670,000 employees, have adopted at least one Tripartite Standard. This means that one in five workers can be assured that their employers have committed to implementing fair and progressive employment practices such as recruiting based on merit, setting out clear terms of engagement, and providing flexible work arrangements.Table 1 below provides a breakdown of the number of employers who have adopted each Tripartite Standard and workers covered. The top three industries with the most adopters of the Tripartite Standards are (i) Infocomm Technology and Media, (ii) Professional Services, and (iii) Wholesale Trade. MOM and the tripartite partners have been working hard to encourage companies to adopt the Tripartite Standards. For instance, the Tripartite Alliance for Fair & Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) has been reaching out to companies, including through promotional campaigns, event roadshows, and briefings to members of Trade Associations and Chambers (TACs). TAFEP also organises clinics on Tripartite Standards to help companies better understand the specifications, so that they can confidently implement those practices before adoption. These concerted MOM and tripartite efforts have led to good progress in the adoption of the Tripartite Standards. We will press on with these efforts."
utilisation of government-paid child care leave scheme and extended child care leave scheme in past five years,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Social and Family Development for each year in the past five years under the Government-Paid Child Care Leave (GPCL) Scheme (a) what percentage of working mothers took (i) four days of childcare leave (ii) five days of childcare leave or (iii) six days of childcare leave respectively; and (b) what percentage of working fathers took (i) four days of childcare leave (ii) five days of childcare leave or (iii) six days of childcare leave respectively.,"32 Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Social and Family Development for each year in the past five years under the Extended Child Care Leave (ECL) Scheme (a) what percentage of working mothers took exactly (i) one day of childcare leave or (ii) two days of childcare leave respectively; and (b) what percentage of working fathers took exactly (i) one day of childcare leave or (ii) two days of childcare leave respectively.Mr Desmond Lee: Working parents with citizen children below seven years of age are provided with six days of paid child care leave. Employers absorb the cost for the first to third days, and the Government reimburses employers for the fourth to sixth days under the Government-Paid Childcare Leave (GPCL) scheme. Utilisation of these Government-paid leaves has been slowly rising. The estimated percentages of eligible working mothers and fathers who took four, five and six days of GPCL respectively in the past three years are in Table 1 below. Introduced in 2013, the Government-Paid ECL provides working parents with two days of paid extended childcare leave per year if they have a citizen child aged seven to 12 years. The estimated percentages of eligible working mothers and fathers who took one or two days of ECL respectively are in Table 2 below. Breakdown of data on the take-up of GPCL and Extended Childcare Leave (ECL) is not available before 2016."
number of persons with disabilities in institutional care in last 10 years,"Mr Chong Kee Hiong asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) in the last 10 years, what is the number of persons with disabilities in institutional care, broken down by 20-year age groups; and (b) whether there has been an increase in these numbers.","Mr Desmond Lee: Persons with Disabilities (PwDs)1 who are receiving institutional care reside in the Children Disability Homes (CDH), Adult Disability Homes (ADH) and Welfare Homes (WH). CDHs admits PwDs below the age of 16 years old. As at June 2019, there were 40 children residing in CDHs. This number has been relatively stable in the last 10 years. The ADHs and WHs provide institutional care for PwDs aged 16 and above. As at June 2019, there were about 890 PwDs from age 16 to 642 residing in ADHs and WHs, compared to 780 PwDs in 2009. Another 110 PwDs aged 65 and above were residents in the ADHs and WHs. The age profile of these PwDs is as follows:Seniors who require assistance in activities of daily living and/or daily nursing care needs, as well as have little or no family support may be cared for in nursing homes. As at end-2018, there were about 12,000 subsidised nursing home residents, compared to 8,000 in end-20143."
options for residential home residents needing additional acute help,"Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Social and Family Development what options are available for those who stay at residential homes but who may still need additional acute help, for example when dealing with mental health issues.","Mr Desmond Lee: MSF's residential homes1 provide care and support to vulnerable individuals who have limited or no family support. These include low-income frail seniors, destitute persons, and adults with disabilities.  The Homes are run by Social Service Agencies (SSAs) and funded by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), providing support to the residents in meeting their daily care needs through a team of in-house care staff and other professionals such as social workers, therapists and nurses. All Homes actively identify residents who may have mental health issues, so that appropriate support can be provided. In addition, some Homes partner external agencies, such as hospitals, Agency for Integrated Care, and Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH) to (i) diagnose and assess the severity of the residents' medical and psychiatric conditions, and (ii) provide physical, mental wellness, rehabilitative and re-integrative programmes, to improve well-being of the residents. Residents who require acute care treatment for physical or mental health conditions are sent to hospitals or the Institute of Mental Health. The Residential Homes staff work closely with the hospitals on post-discharge care and monitoring after the residents return to the Homes."
update on suggestion for president to issue congratulatory notes to singaporean centenarians on their birthdays,Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Social and Family Development whether he can provide an update on his Ministry's study of the suggestion made in the House on 8 March 2017 that the President of Singapore issue congratulatory notes to Singaporean centenarians on the occasion of their birthdays.,"Mr Desmond Lee: We thank Mr Pillai for his suggestion, and agree that the birthday of a centenarian is a significant occasion. It would be most meaningful to celebrate such an occasion via grassroots-led ground up efforts, where we celebrate not just the birthdays of centenarians, but the kinship and community bonds forged with family, neighbours, and the broader community. Grassroots and community leaders would be well-placed to organise such celebrations in an organic manner. The Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) and other agencies, such as the Silver Generation Office, would be happy to support these efforts, for example, through sharing of information on centenarians whom the agencies come into contact with and who would like be involved in these celebrations. "
number of free trade agreements and studies on their economic and social benefits,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) how many Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) does Singapore have as of today; (b) how many are in the pipeline to be signed/ratified and with whom; (c) whether the Ministry has conducted detailed studies of economic and social benefits of each or most of the bilateral and multiparty FTAs; and (d) if so, what are these benefits and how much change in trade has been seen after the FTA with each of the trade partners has been implemented.","Mr Chan Chun Sing: Singapore currently has 24 Free Trade Agreements (FTAs). We are also working with the European Commission to bring the EU-Singapore FTA (EUSFTA), which was ratified by the European Parliament in February 2019, into force at the end of 2019.1 In addition, we are negotiating the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which connects all ten ASEAN economies with six other economies accounting for about 30% of global Gross Domestic Product (GDP), as well as FTAs with the Eurasian Economic Union, MERCOSUR, and the Pacific Alliance.Our trade and investment partnerships create opportunities for our economy and strengthen our strategic relations with other countries. A study by the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) estimated that on average, Singapore's domestic exports to an FTA partner increased by 18% two years after its entry into force, and a further 16% in the third year.2 New agreements such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and the EUSFTA can potentially increase Singapore's GDP by up to 0.2% and 0.35% respectively.3 Our FTAs also make it easier for our companies to do business in foreign countries by providing preferential market access for our businesses, including lower tariff and non-tariff barriers for Singapore goods, fewer restrictions for services sectors, and enhanced protection for investments.  Beyond market access benefits, FTAs also establish common enforceable rules that provide certainty for businesses. For instance, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership's (CPTPP) rules for intellectual property rights and e-commerce help attract research and development, and spur the growth of transformative digital services that we all enjoy today.  MTI regularly reviews our trade agreements to account for new business models and regulations. With the rapid growth of the digital economy, we have started negotiating digital economy agreements with Chile and New Zealand, as well as a collaboration with Australia. We also upgrade our FTAs in light of changing economic circumstances. For instance, we upgraded our FTA with China in November 2018, to provide our businesses with enhanced investment protection, greater access to China’s legal, maritime and construction services sectors, and improved Rules of Origin for petrochemical and plastics exports."
statistics on children below seven years old and between seven and 12 years old contracting hfmd in the past five years,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Health for each year in the past five years among children (i) below 7 years old and (ii) between 7 and 12 years old (inclusive), what is the absolute number and the percentage of children who contracted Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease (HFMD) (i) once (ii) twice or (iii) three or more times respectively.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease (HFMD) is a common childhood illness. Most children recover from HFMD on their own without treatment. As HFMD infections are not reportable and the majority are mild, the Ministry of Health (MOH) does not track the number or percentage of children who have contracted HFMD and the number of times they have contracted the disease during their life. As HFMD can be caused by different viruses, infection by one virus does not confer immunity to other viruses. As such, a person who has recovered from HFMD may be infected again. The key to controlling the spread of HFMD is to maintain high standards of personal and environmental hygiene, and to seek medical treatment early when the child is unwell. MOH works closely with the Ministry of Education (MOE), Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) and People's Association (PA) to ensure that educational institutions, including childcare centres, remain vigilant and take measures to minimise the spread of infectious diseases. Parents should also ensure that their children with HFMD remain at home for the duration of the illness as advised by the doctors, to prevent spread to others.  "
statistics on divorcees who failed to comply with court orders to sell their matrimonial flats within stipulated time,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Law for each year in the past five years (a) what is the absolute number and the percentage of divorcees who failed to comply with court orders to sell their matrimonial flats within the stipulated time; and (b) what was the average and median time it took beyond the stipulated time to sell the flat.,"Mr K Shanmugam: We have checked, and have been informed that the time taken to complete the sale of such matrimonial flats, upon divorce, and whether there was compliance with time limits set in Court Orders is not tracked by any agency. The terms of the Court Orders, and whether any extension of time is needed by the parties, is a matter between the parties, unless the parties inform the Housing and Development Board (HDB) of the same. Parties may apply to Court for an extension of time to sell the flat. Parties can sell their HDB flat as long as they are able to reach an agreement in doing so, and HDB will process the sale accordingly. It also depends on the terms of the Court Orders."
consideration to make government financial statements available online,Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for Finance (a) whether the Government Financial Statements can be made available online for public perusal; and (b) what are the reasons for not making them available online.,"Mr Heng Swee Keat: The Government Financial Statements (GFS) comprises yearly detailed statements of government accounts, prepared by the Accountant-General in accordance with the Constitution and Financial Procedure Act for the purpose of submission to the President and the Parliament. Copies of the GFS are made available for access by Members of Parliament in the Parliament Library, and for public access in the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library. To make it easier for the public to understand the detailed statements in the GFS, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) extracts relevant information from the GFS every year and publishes them in the Budget Book and other documents related to the Budget. These information are made available online on the MOF website. We will continue to review and update the various methods in which we release and publish information on Government accounts."
"amount of cash paid by singaporeans and permanent residents after account subsidies, medishield life and medisave deductions","Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for Health in respect of subsidised hospitalisation for each year from 2015 to 2017, how much did Singaporeans and permanent residents respectively pay in cash at the 10th to 40th deciles after taking into account subsidies, MediShield Life and MediSave deductions.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: From 2015 to 2017, Singaporean Citizens and Permanent Residents at the 10th to 40th percentile of subsidised hospitalisation bills paid $0 in cash, after taking into account subsidies, MediShield Life and MediSave deductions. Over the same period, the median amount of cash paid by Singaporean Citizens in the 10th to 40th per capita household income percentiles for subsidised hospitalisations was also $0, after taking into account subsidies, MediShield Life and MediSave deductions. The corresponding figures for Permanent Residents ranged from $38 to $47 over the same period."
usage of government-paid paternity leave and shared parental leave by fathers in past five years,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Social and Family Development for each year in the past five years, what percentage of fathers did not take any Government-Paid Paternity Leave and Shared Parental Leave respectively.","Mr Desmond Lee: Government-Paid Paternity Leave (GPPL) and Shared Parental Leave (SPL) were both introduced in 2013 to support fathers in playing a bigger role in child-raising. Since 2017, fathers have been eligible for two weeks of GPPL (doubled from one week previously), and up to four weeks of SPL (increased from one week previously), shared from their spouse's Maternity Leave. The estimated percentages of fathers who did not take at least one day of GPPL or SPL in the last five years are shown in Tables 1 and 2 below. The percentages are based on records of employers who have submitted claims for the leave taken by their employees, and the pool of eligible fathers based on working status of fathers as declared at the point of application for Baby Bonus. The take-up of GPPL increased between 2013 and 2017. More than half of eligible fathers took GPPL in the 2017 cohort. The GPPL take-up for 2018 will likely increase further as fathers can take paternity leave up to one year after their child's birth, and employers then have up to three months after the leave was taken to submit claims. Consistent with the experience of other countries, fewer fathers take SPL than GPPL. Nevertheless, SPL provides parents the option to manage their caregiving arrangements flexibly."
rationale for setting seven days as minimum legal entitlement for annual leave,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the rationale for setting seven days as the minimum legal entitlement for annual leave; and (b) whether the Ministry has plans to increase the number so that Singapore can rank higher among developed nations for annual leave entitlement.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: The Employment Act (EA) stipulates employees' minimum terms and working conditions, including for paid annual leave. It seeks to protect the basic interests of employees while balancing business needs and ensuring employees' employability. Specific to annual leave, the statutory minimum entitlement of seven days applies to employees who have worked with their employer for at least three months, but not more than one year. With each year of service, an employee's statutory entitlement increases, up to 14 days.  Statutory annual leave entitlements vary across developed economies. Some like the United Kingdom and Australia have relatively more generous provisions, while the United States does not have a federal law regulating paid annual leave. The minimum statutory annual leave entitlement in Singapore is comparable to that in jurisdictions such as Hong Kong and Taiwan. Singapore's statutory annual leave entitlements should also be viewed alongside the paid sick leave, childcare leave, and other forms of leave provided for in our laws. Employees can use these other forms of leave over and above their annual leave entitlements. In other jurisdictions, such leave may not be available, or fully paid. The Ministry of Manpower (MOM), together with the tripartite partners, completed a review of the EA in 2018. While there are currently no plans to increase the minimum statutory annual leave entitlement, MOM will continue to monitor employment trends both locally and internationally, and regularly review our laws and policies."
childcare centres' utilisation of annual closure days for each of past five years,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Social and Family Development for each year in the past five years, what percentage of childcare centres utilise (i) the full six days of annual closure (ii) five days of annual closure and (iii) fewer than five days of annual closure respectively.","Mr Desmond Lee: Childcare centres are allowed to close for up to a maximum of six days each year to carry out organisational activities, such as curriculum planning and staff training. This also includes one day off for early childhood educators on Teachers' Day. Preschool operators take the opportunity to bring their staff together for skills upgrading on a range of topics, such as teaching methods and child management, updates on operational procedures for the safety and well-being of children, as well as team bonding activities.In setting the guidelines on closure days for childcare centres, the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) strives to balance parents' childcare needs and the operational needs of childcare centres. Centres are required to inform parents about closure days at the beginning of each calendar year, and remind parents one month prior to each closure day. This enables parents to make alternative care arrangements for their children.From information provided by centres, the majority of centres utilise the full six days of closure annually. In 2018, 77% of centres who reported their closure days to ECDA1 had utilised the full six days of annual closure. 94% of centres that reported to ECDA utilised five or more days of annual closure."
percentage of households switching suppliers in open electricity market,"Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) how many households, expressed as a percentage, have switched to purchasing electricity from suppliers other than SP since the launch of the Open Electricity Market; and (b) whether the Energy Market Authority is actively considering a simpler sign-up procedure for low-income households in particular.","Mr Chan Chun Sing: From May this year, all consumers have the option of buying electricity from a retailer of their choice under the Open Electricity Market (OEM). As of end-June 2019, about 34% of household consumers have made the switch.The switching process for OEM consumers was designed to be simple and accessible to all, regardless of income or household types. OEM consumers can approach their preferred retailer to sign up and can do so via different channels, including online, over the phone, as well as at the retailer's roadshows or physical stores. The retailer will then work directly with SP Group to make the switch. Surveys commissioned by the Energy Market Authority (EMA) show that 98% of OEM consumers who have switched to a retailer found the switching process easy. We have also introduced the necessary consumer safeguards; OEM consumers have access to various avenues, such as the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) or the Small Claims Tribunal, for dispute resolution in the event of any contractual dispute with their retailers.EMA will continue to work with SP Group and retailers to provide a positive consumer experience under the OEM."
average per-undergraduate student annual expenditure on teaching and education services,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Education (a) what is the average per-undergraduate student annual expenditure on teaching and educational services broken down by faculty/school for each of the autonomous universities; and (b) what is the breakdown of the source of such expenditure by tuition revenue, government grant and endowment income.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: Expenditure for undergraduate education varies across the Autonomous Universities (AUs) and course clusters, depending on factors, such as the education model and pedagogy, faculty-to-student ratio for the courses, and the capital costs involved in delivering the course. Courses with better faculty-to-student ratios include the law programmes, while courses with higher capital costs include laboratory-based programmes like computing, science and engineering.For similar courses, the Ministry of Education (MOE) does not vary our funding to AUs based on their expenditure. Instead, we establish a per-student cost norm for similar courses across universities and fund programmes based on these norms. This approach encourages cost discipline across our AUs even as they strive to deliver high quality undergraduate education. Overall, the average Government funding for operating expenses per undergraduate in FY2019 is around $22,000.Government grants continue to be the main source of funding for university education. Students generally pay around 25% of the cost of education. The AUs tap on income from endowment, which is built up with Government matching, to supplement Government funding for their programmes."
time from lodgement of claim at tripartite alliance for dispute management and referral to employment claims tribunal,Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Manpower in each of the last three years (a) what are the average and median lengths of time between the lodgement of a claim at the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management and the subsequent referral of the claim to the Employment Claims Tribunal through the issuance of a claim referral certificate; and (b) in how many of these cases have the process taken more than eight weeks.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: In both 2017 and 2018, the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM) resolved about 85% of salary claims filed under the Employment Claims Act (ECA). The remaining 15% of claims were referred to the Employment Claims Tribunals (ECT) for adjudication through the issuance of a claim referral certificate.More than 80% salary claims filed under the ECA were successfully resolved within eight weeks. Cases referred to the ECT tend to be more complex and difficult and may take a longer time to resolve. "
number of rioting incidents per year from 2010 to 2018,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Home Affairs how many incidents of rioting occurred per year from 2010 to 2018.,Mr K Shanmugam: The number of incidents of rioting from 2010 to 2018 are as follows: 
study to determine existence of pattern of dengue cluster formation for preventive action to be taken,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether NEA has done any study to determine the existence of a pattern of where dengue clusters form so that preventive action can be carried out.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The National Environmental Agency (NEA) has conducted scientific studies to study the risk of dengue transmission across Singapore. One example is the use of big data and geographic information systems to analyse mosquito breeding and dengue transmission patterns. These studies have found that the risk of dengue transmission increases with higher population density, Aedes aegypti population, extent of urbanisation and historical incidence of dengue. This provides a useful guide for NEA's vector control operations. For instance, before the traditional dengue season every year, NEA deploys additional manpower to areas identified as higher risk to conduct intensive source reduction activities to remove mosquito breeding habitats. Throughout the year, NEA conducts routine inspections and search-and-destroy operations guided by data collected by the Aedes surveillance system, which comprises 50,000 Gravitraps deployed islandwide. Developed in-house, Gravitraps are designed to attract and trap adult female Aedes mosquitoes, the vector responsible for the transmission of dengue, chikungunya and zika. The surveillance system shows that a persistently high Aedes aegypti population increases the risk of localised dengue transmission and the odds of a dengue cluster forming. An additional 14,000 Gravitraps are progressively being deployed to increase the area of coverage. Everyone has a part to play in preventing the spread of dengue. Between January and June this year, about 70% of mosquito breeding habitats detected in dengue clusters were found in homes. The community must play its part and step up the eradication of mosquito breeding habitats by practising the 5-step Mozzie Wipe-out regularly. Effective source reduction by all stakeholders is key to preventing the formation of dengue clusters and disrupting the transmission cycles of the dengue virus in our community."
public buildings without family-friendly facilities and plans to encourage owners to retrofit such facilities,"Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for National Development (a) currently, how many public buildings frequented by families do not have family-friendly facilities such as a lactation room or a diaper changing room; and (b) what is being done to encourage the owners to retrofit such facilities in these existing buildings.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Since April 2014, new buildings that are frequented by families such as transport hubs, sports complexes, community clubs and larger shopping malls of more than 10,000 square metres in gross floor area, are required to provide family-friendly facilities under the Building and Construction Authority's (BCA) Code on Accessibility. Such facilities include lactation rooms and diaper changing stations. Existing buildings which undergo major retrofitting works also need to meet these requirements. To date, about 90 buildings have been newly developed or have undergone major retrofitting, and all have met the requirements. However, the actual number of buildings with family-friendly facilities is likely to be higher, as other building owners may have moved to provide such facilities on their own as part of their renovation works, for example, in malls. BCA does not track such buildings if they did not undergo major retrofitting works. From 2020, lactation rooms will also be required in more building types, including healthcare facilities. BCA provides funding support under the Accessibility Fund for private building owners who wish to retrofit pre-1990 buildings with family-friendly facilities. For each eligible development, the Fund supports up to 60% of the retrofitting cost, up to a cap of $300,000. In addition to funding, BCA also worked with MSF to introduce a voluntary certification scheme in 2018 – the Universal Design Mark for Family-Friendly Business – to recognise businesses that provide family-friendly facilities and services.

statistics on users of home-based and community-based eldercare services and average out-of-pocket expenditure after maximum subsidy,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the typical profile of people who use home-based eldercare services; (b) how many activities of daily living (ADLs) do people who use home-based eldercare services typically require assistance with; (c) how many people use other types of subsidised services in addition to home-based eldercare services; and (d) what is the average out-of-pocket expenditure, after receiving the maximum subsidies they are eligible for, for people using home-based and community-based services together and separately.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Based on records submitted by care providers to MOH, in the fourth quarter of 2018, around 16,000 Singapore residents were using subsidised home and/or community care services, of which around 7,000 used subsidised home care services. Around six in ten subsidised home care clients were female. Around half were aged 80 and above, around three in ten were aged 70 to 79, and the remainder were aged 69 and below. The vast majority of home care clients would be home-bound with chronic conditions or disabilities, and require assistance with some Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), in particular in the area of mobility.  Around one in ten home care clients also use community-based care services such as day rehabilitation or respite care services. Depending on the needs of patients, the most commonly used home care service is home nursing, which is on average, about $95 per visit before any subsidies and about $20 per visit for a client receiving the maximum subsidy. The Integrated Home and Day Care (IHDC) pilot introduced in 2016 bundles both home- and community-based services, and gives us an estimate of the expenditure of clients using services in both settings together. Depending on the bundle, the fees range between $1,100 to $2,300 per month before any subsidies, and about $300 to $600 per month for a client receiving the maximum subsidy. Singaporeans who need further financial assistance after subsidies can apply through the medical social workers or the providers for MediFund or other assistance. "
availability and plans to raise awareness of egg donor scheme,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Health in cases where women are unable to conceive due to issues with their egg quality (a) what is the egg donor scheme that is currently available and whether there is sufficient awareness about it; (b) whether there are plans to raise such awareness; (c) what can be done to enhance the egg donor scheme to encourage and ensure the availability of more donors; and (d) whether mothers with spare eggs or women who froze their eggs but no longer need them can donate the eggs to other women who need them.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: For women who are unable to conceive due to issues with their egg quality, there are several avenues currently available to them in obtaining donor eggs for their assisted reproduction (AR) treatment. Altruistic egg donation is allowed in Singapore. However, due to the invasiveness of the ovarian simulation and egg retrieval procedure, there are a limited number of egg donors. AR practitioners would generally counsel their patients to seek egg donations from relatives or close friends. Alternatively, egg donations can also be received from unrelated donors, and these are frequently from women who are already undergoing their own AR treatment.AR centres are mandated to provide counselling for couples before the start of any treatment, and to discuss, amongst other issues, the couple's wishes regarding the eggs or embryos that remain after their treatment is completed. Women who wish to donate their remaining frozen eggs or embryos to other couples can do so, and the AR centres will facilitate the egg donation at the appropriate time."
statistics on seven-year-old and 12-year-old children contracting hfmd in the past five years,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Health for each year in the past five years, what is the absolute number and the percentage of (i) 7-year-old children and (ii) 12-year-old children who have contracted Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease (HFMD) at least once during their life.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease (HFMD) is a common childhood illness that is usually mild. Most children recover from HFMD on their own without treatment. As HFMD infections are not reportable and the majority are mild, MOH does not track the number or percentage of children who have contracted HFMD at least once during their life. The key to controlling the spread of HFMD is to maintain high standards of personal and environmental hygiene, and to seek medical treatment early when the child is unwell. MOH works closely with the Ministry of Education (MOE), Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) and People's Association (PA) to ensure that educational institutions, including childcare centres, remain vigilant and take measures to minimise the spread of infectious diseases. Parents should also ensure that their children with HFMD remain at home for the duration of the illness as advised by the doctors, to prevent spread to others.  "
statistics on number of cases heard by community dispute resolution tribunal since inception,Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Law since the inception of the Community Dispute Resolution Tribunal (CDRT) (a) what is the total number of cases that have been heard by CDRT and the breakdown for each year to-date; (b) what is the percentage of the total number of cases where an order on mandatory mediation is made; and (c) what is the total number of exclusion orders made.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals (CDRT) were established on 1 October 2015 as a forum to facilitate the resolution of disputes between neighbours after other avenues such as community mediation have been exhausted.Between 1 October 2015 and 30 June 2019, the CDRT received a total of 324 applications. Out of these 324 applications, 294 cases have been disposed of, while 30 cases are still pending as at 30 June 2019.The breakdown of cases received by the CDRT for each year to-date is as follows: 27 cases were received in 2015, 80 cases were received in 2016, 57 cases were received in 2017, and 108 cases were received in 2018. Between 1 January 2019 to 30 June 2019, 52 cases were received. The CDRT has made a mandatory mediation order in 82 cases. This represents about 25% of the cases thus far.To-date, the CDRT has not made any exclusion orders. Two applications for an exclusion order were received in 2018. However, in both cases, the CDRT declined to make the exclusion order. "
statistics on bto flats purchased under single singapore citizen scheme,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for National Development how many Singaporeans have bought BTO flats under the Single Singapore Citizen Scheme since its inception and how many have gone on to get married, with the figures broken down by gender.","Mr Lawrence Wong: About 20,100 Singaporeans have booked a 2-room or 2-room Flexi flat in HDB's sales exercises under the Single Singapore Citizen Scheme since its inception in July 2013. The proportions of male and female flat buyers are roughly equal. Amongst these flat buyers, about 440 subsequently registered a marriage in Singapore, of whom about 80% are male."
posting and collection of merdeka generation packages,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Health whether Merdeka Generation Package recipients who have been asked to collect their Merdeka Generation Packages from community clubs or events are entitled to ask for the packages to be sent to them by post instead and with exactly the same benefits as those collecting from community clubs or events.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Merdeka Generation (MG) Package recipients who had been invited to collect their MG Packages from community clubs or events but were unable to do so, will have their packages sent to them by post instead. Whether they receive the package at community events or by post, all eligible MG seniors will receive the same MG Package benefits and MG welcome folders. As of 26 July 2019, all the MG packages have been delivered."
update on trend of new comcare recipients over the last five years,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what is the trend of new ComCare recipients over the last five years; (b) what is the proportion of recipients who require ComCare support beyond the initial support of three months; and (c) how does the Ministry ensure that the level of support is adequate relative to changing costs of living.,"Mr Desmond Lee: The table below shows the number of unique households receiving ComCare Long-Term Assistance1 (LTA) and Short-to-Medium-Term Assistance2 (SMTA) from FY2013 to FY2017. MSF does not have readily available data on the number of new recipients for ComCare LTA and SMTA from FY2013 to FY2017.In FY2017, 66.5% of households on ComCare SMTA received assistance for a total duration of longer than three months.MSF regularly reviews the cash assistance rates and the ComCare eligibility criteria. In our review, we look at daily living expenditure data of low-income families collected by the Department of Statistics. We also consider input from community stakeholders, such as social workers and frontline officers. We most recently increased our ComCare cash assistance rates from 1 July 2019. Apart from monthly cash assistance for their daily living expenses, households may also receive employment assistance, assistance with their household bills and medical bills, and referrals to other Government agencies and community partners for relevant services. "
number of hdb occupiers unable to make claims under home protection scheme in last three years due to lapse of policy,"Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Manpower in the last three years, how many HDB occupiers were unable to make claims under the Home Protection Scheme because the policy lapsed.","Mrs Josephine Teo: From 2016 to 2018, the Home Protection Scheme (HPS) helped to pay the remaining mortgage for about 3,000 HDB flat owners who passed away, became terminally ill or suffered from total permanent disability. Another 20 claims were unsuccessful as the members' HPS policies had lapsed.We have put in place several measures to minimise the risk that HDB flat owners lapse on their HPS coverage. (a) HPS premiums are automatically deducted from the flat owner's CPF Ordinary Account (OA). This minimises any out-of-pocket payments for the HPS premium.(b) Flat owners can tap on their co-owners' CPF-OA savings to help pay the HPS premium.(c) If flat owners miss their premium payment despite the above measures, CPF Board will offer a two-month grace period for the flat owner to pay the HPS premium. CPF Board will send letters to remind the flat owner to top up his CPF-OA and will prioritise new OA contributions for HPS premiums over mortgage instalments during this grace period. The flat owner's HPS coverage will lapse if he does not pay the premium by the end of the two-month grace period. For flat owners whose coverage has lapsed and are using CPF to pay their mortgage instalments, CPF Board continues to send letters every six months reminding them to re-apply for HPS coverage. In the few cases of unsuccessful claims where the HPS has lapsed, dependants can seek HDB's assistance to reduce or defer mortgage payments until the family regains financial stability, or right-size to a more affordable flat if they choose to do so."
review of maximum age cap for coverage under dependants' protection scheme,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Manpower (a) when will the next review of the maximum age cap for coverage under the Dependants' Protection Scheme be; and (b) whether the Ministry has considered that the current generation is starting families at a later age and hence may still have dependants at age 60.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: The Dependants' Protection Scheme (DPS) is a term-life insurance scheme that provides CPF members and their family a basic level of financial relief at affordable premiums in the event of terminal illness, total permanent disability or death. The decision to offer DPS coverage up till 60 strikes a balance between providing insurance protection for the member's dependants and his need for adequate retirement savings:(a) First, raising the maximum coverage age beyond 60 would result in significantly higher premiums due to higher mortality rates after age 60. DPS premiums are paid out of members' CPF accounts, and paying for significantly higher premiums would compromise members' retirement adequacy. (b) Second, after age 60, the need for DPS is significantly reduced as most members are less likely to have children who are financially dependent. Those who started families later and may still have dependants are likely to have accumulated savings in their CPF accounts which could be bequeathed to their dependants. Members who prefer additional insurance protection may use cash to purchase insurance products from private insurers. We will, however, continue to review other aspects of the scheme to ensure that DPS continues to be relevant to members."
adoption of tripartite standard on unpaid leave for unexpected care needs by employers since its introduction,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Manpower since the introduction of the Tripartite Standard on Unpaid Leave for Unexpected Care Needs (a) how many employers have adopted the Standard; and (b) what is the utilisation rate of the unpaid leave among eligible employees.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: The Tripartite Standard on Unpaid Leave for Unexpected Care Needs was introduced in March 2018. As of end June 2019, about 700 employers with 242,000 workers have adopted the Standard. We collect data on the utilisation of paid leave rather than unpaid leave. This is because employees are more likely to utilise their paid leave first before considering unpaid leave to minimise loss of income. We will consider the need to also collect data on unpaid leave in future. "
twenty-fifth and 50th percentiles of annual leave entitlement received by employees and management,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Manpower what are the 25th and 50th percentiles of annual leave entitlement received by (i) rank and file employees (ii) management and executives and (iii) all employees respectively.,Mrs Josephine Teo: The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) does not have records of the data requested.
statistics on mrt train delays not more than five minutes for past three years,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Transport what are the incidences of MRT train delays of not more than five minutes for each of the MRT lines in each of the past three years.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The number of short delays between two to five minutes is tabulated below:Performance continued to improve, in tandem with overall improvements in rail reliability. Such minor delays did not exceed one per day, with the exception of the East-West Line which is our longest MRT line.While delays below two minutes are logged, we do not track the statistics as they have less to do with reliability issues. For example, they could be due to trains being held back slightly to allow more passengers to board and alight.Tracking the absolute number of delays is no substitute for the use of Mean Kilometres Between Failure, or MKBF. The latter measures the average distance travelled by trains between delays lasting more than five minutes. This allows performance to be compared between lines of different lengths and operating intensities. MKBF is an objective and internationally recognised measure of rail reliability, which is why we use it to benchmark our performance against leading metros around the world."
updates on commuter graciousness index and plans to engage in public education,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Transport (a) what are the latest Commuter Graciousness Index results; (b) what is the frequency of these surveys; and (c) whether there are plans to engage in public education at regular intervals to remind all commuters to be gracious.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The Land Transport Authority (LTA) conducts the Commuter Graciousness survey every one to two years. The latest survey shows that the percentage of commuters noticing gracious behaviour on public transport has increased, from 52% in 2016 to 56% in 2018. Fostering a gracious and caring commuting culture takes time. We will press on with our efforts to promote gracious commuting behaviour. Since 2009, LTA and its partners have been organising the annual Graciousness Campaign. For this year's campaign, LTA worked with students from the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA) to conceptualise trendy new outfits for LTA's public transport mascots, also known as the Thoughtful Bunch. The new styles convey the message that anyone can be like the Thoughtful Bunch. The refreshed publicity materials and engagement activities help to create greater awareness among our commuters.  There are also efforts led by the Public Transport Council (PTC) to encourage commuters to step forward and lend a helping hand to fellow commuters. For instance, PTC and the Singapore Kindness Movement recently announced a new Caring Commuter Award to recognise caring acts by commuters. PTC is also expanding its Heart Zones to more MRT stations and bus interchanges, to connect commuters with other commuters who need help travelling to their destinations.Ultimately, we all have a role to play to look out for one another, and to make all commuters feel welcome."
plans for more bus lanes to facilitate safer and smoother bus journeys,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Transport whether there are plans to implement more bus lanes islandwide to facilitate safer and smoother bus journeys.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Today, we have a total of 211 kilometres of bus lanes, and LTA plans to build more. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) is rolling out a suite of bus speed improvement measures to facilitate safer and smoother bus journeys. For instance, LTA has started to implement Transit Priority Corridors (TPCs), featuring bus lanes, bus-only roads, and signal priority for buses. The first TPC was implemented at Bencoolen Street in 2017, and more will be progressively implemented from 2020 onwards. The North-South Corridor will be Singapore's longest TPC. When completed by 2026, it will save bus passengers an average of 10 to 15 minutes of travel time. LTA is also exploring an enhanced traffic light control system which can give priority to buses based on real-time traffic demand. LTA is also trying out three-door buses to speed up boarding and alighting. Together, these measures will deliver smoother and safer bus journeys."
phasing out announcement of names and registration numbers of voters on polling day,Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Prime Minister whether the practice of announcing the names and registration numbers of voters on polling day will be phased out under the e-registration system since verification can be done discreetly on screen in a multi-lingual format for both voters and polling agents alike.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing (for the Prime Minister): Under the Parliamentary Elections Act, the voter’s name and serial number as stated in the register of electors must be called out by election officials, immediately before the ballot paper is issued to the voter. This allows the polling agents present to check against their own copies of registers and verify that the voter is eligible to vote at the polling station. This is separate from the e-registration process and ensures that only voters who are assigned to vote at the specific polling station are issued with ballot papers. There is no plan to change this after the implementation of e-registration. "
updates on footpath widening projects to accommodate pedestrians and pmd users,"Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Transport in light of the increasing use of PMDs in housing estates (a) what is the status of existing projects to widen footpaths in housing estates and what is the completion date for the projects; (b) whether there are further plans to upgrade or widen more footpaths to accommodate both pedestrians and PMD users more safely; and (c) if so, what is the timeline for these plans.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: I thank the Member for the question, which has been addressed by the Ministerial Statement on Personal Mobility Devices delivered on 5 August 2019."
measures to deter reckless driving of pmds,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Transport what legal tools can be used to deter the reckless driving of PMDs especially where such reckless PMD usage causes or could cause serious injury to pedestrians on footpaths or serious collisions with vehicles carefully driven by drivers.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: I thank the Member for the question, which has been addressed by the Ministerial Statement on Personal Mobility Devices delivered on 5 August 2019."
measures to incentivise businesses to rely on sustainable packaging material instead of single-use plastics,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what measures will be put in place to incentivise businesses to rely on sustainable packaging material instead of single-use plastics; and (b) what steps are being taken to deter or reduce the usage of single-use plastic containers or plastic bags in Singapore.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Packaging waste, including plastics, is one of the three priority waste streams in Singapore. To tackle this issue, my Ministry and the National Environment Agency (NEA) have adopted a holistic approach to reduce the excessive use of all types of packaging, not just single-use plastics. We do not target plastics alone. The NEA conducted a life-cycle assessment of single-use carrier bags and disposables and found that substituting plastics with other types of single-use packaging materials is not necessarily better for the environment. As such, our focus is to promote the use of reusables. The National Environment Agency (NEA) recently launched the nation-wide ""Say YES to Waste Less"" campaign to drive awareness of the impact of excessive consumption of disposables and the need for reduction. Some 1,600 premises, ranging from retailers, food and beverage establishments, supermarkets, hotels, Community Development Councils, grassroots organisations, schools and non-governmental organisations, have come forward to partner NEA. Partners commit to actions such as prompting customers to bring along reusables, encouraging them to decline disposable cutlery with online orders and displaying campaign visuals at cashier points. NEA has also launched the 'Towards Zero Waste Grant' to support individuals, interest groups, non-Governmental organisations, grassroots organisations and corporations to initiate or scale up waste reduction and recycling initiatives. Moving upstream, starting next year, NEA will require brand owners, manufacturers and importers of packaged goods, as well as supermarkets with an annual turnover exceeding $10 million to report information on the packaging they place on the market, and their plans for reducing, reusing or recycling packaging annually. This will increase companies' awareness of the potential for waste reduction in their business operations. Companies should take action to reduce the amount of packaging used, and minimise waste generation at source. This mandatory reporting framework will also lay the foundation for an Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) framework for managing packaging waste including plastics, which NEA will put in place no later than 2025.  Besides reducing waste, we are taking actions to increase our recycling rate. For example, we are working with the industry to tap on the Towards Zero Waste Grant to roll out 50 reverse vending machines starting this year. Through this initiative, we hope to engage the public to consciously recycle used PET bottles and aluminium cans. At the same time, we are developing the local recycling industry. We want to better extract resources from waste and close the waste loop through a circular economy approach. NEA is currently studying recycling solutions and technologies, and assessing their suitability for adoption in Singapore. This may include mechanical recycling to turn waste plastics into plastic pellets for manufacturing new products, or chemical recycling to turn plastic waste into chemical feedstock or fuel. The Government will work with industry stakeholders to explore how these technologies can be applied to Singapore, such that it is both environmentally and economically sustainable. These are efforts which could help grow local enterprises and create good jobs for Singaporeans. Everyone needs to play our part to reduce packaging waste, including single-use plastics. We can do this in different ways. For example, we can opt out of receiving disposable cutlery when ordering food for takeaway or delivery, or we can bring our own reusable bags and containers and take only the plastic bags we need. The support of the public, businesses and the community is key to successfully reducing our packaging waste."
industry or service sector employing most number of senior workers,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Manpower (a) which is the industry or service sector that currently employs the most number of senior workers and what is their ratio against the total number of employees; and (b) what are the additional measures that the Ministry will adopt to encourage companies to retain their older workers before they consider applying for foreign workers.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: In 2018, the sector that employed the most number of residents aged 55 and over was Wholesale Trade (54,500), which includes businesses, such as brand owners, distributors of other companies' brands, trading arms of manufacturers and retailers, and large commodities trading houses. These workers accounted for 23% of all employed residents within the sector, which is similar to the overall proportion of employed residents of this age group (24%) in Singapore.To enhance the employability of senior workers, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has in place a number of measures, and these are also regularly reviewed. For instance, the Special Employment Credit (SEC), which has been extended till end 2020, provides wage offsets of up to 11% to employers that hire older Singaporeans aged 55 and above, earning up to $4,000 per month. Employers can also receive support of up to $300,000 per company under the WorkPro Job Redesign Grant to redesign jobs and workplaces to make them easier, safer and smarter for senior workers. Under the Adapt and Grow initiative, the Professional Conversion Programme and Career Support Programme provide higher levels of training and salary support to encourage employers to hire mature Singaporeans aged 40 and above. These pro-senior measures have encouraged and supported companies in hiring older Singaporeans. Over the years, our employment rates of senior workers or residents aged 55 to 64 years have improved significantly. It grew from 57% in 2008 to 67% in 2018, and ranks favourably compared to OECD countries.In addition, we are continuing to calibrate the foreign workforce policy to keep our labour market tight so as to ensure that Singaporeans, especially senior workers, continue to access good jobs and opportunities. We have cut the foreign worker Dependency Ratio Ceiling (DRC) and S Pass sub-DRC in the Services sector to 35% and 10% respectively by 2021. Last year, MOM also convened the Tripartite Workgroup on Older Workers to review retirement and re-employment ages. The Workgroup is finalising its recommendations; more details would be announced by September.  "
mediation cases by tripartite alliance dispute management subsequently withdrawn in last three years due to payment or resolution through formal settlement agreement,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Manpower with regard to cases registered for mediation by the Tripartite Alliance Dispute Management in each of the last three years that were then subsequently withdrawn due to payment, part-payment or resolution through a formal settlement agreement (a) what were the respective average and median proportions of the settlement amounts compared to the amounts initially claimed; and (b) how many claimants were not paid the settlement amount in full within four weeks of registering the settlement agreement in the District Court.","Mrs Josephine Teo: The Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM) has concluded about 15,000 salary claims lodged between April 2017 when it was established and December 2018. Two-thirds of the claims were either resolved through payment from employers in a private settlement or by way of a settlement agreement which when registered with the District Court can be enforceable. Of the remaining one-third, about half were referred to the Employment Claims Tribunals for adjudication as the disputes could not be resolved through mediation, and the other half were withdrawn by the claimants because they found that their claims were weak or invalid.Initial claims are not always accurate or valid. The ratio of settlement to initial claims is therefore not a meaningful indicator. During mediation, TADM mediators will work with the parties involved to verify the actual amount of salary arrears. Claimants may settle for less if the employer is in genuine financial difficulty. Nonetheless, vast majority of the settlements were close to or same as the valid amounts claimed.  Once a settlement agreement has been reached, TADM will actively monitor payment by calling the claimants within three working days of the scheduled payment date, which is arrived at by mutual agreement between the two parties. Sometimes, the claimant is not contactable or cannot remember when he was paid. More importantly, when a claimant reports to TADM that he did not receive any payment after the agreed payment date, TADM will immediately engage the employer concerned and remind the employer to pay up. The matter will also be reported to MOM for possible enforcement follow up.  Ninety-three percent of the claimants have reported that they received full payment based on the settlement amount. Another 4% reported partial payment, and the remaining 3% reported no payment. Enforcement action is taken against all employers who do not pay up, including suspension of their work pass privileges. The more egregious employers are prosecuted. "
sector employing most number of employment pass holders and s pass holders,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Manpower (a) which is the industry or service sector that currently employs the most number of employment pass holders and S Pass holders respectively; (b) what is their respective ratio of employment pass and S Pass holders against (i) Singaporean employees and (ii) Singaporean employees of equivalent education and experience; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider implementing a quota by nationality of source to avoid high concentrations of employment pass and S Pass holders.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: S Pass holders in the Services sector are already subject to quotas capped at 15% of the firm's total workforce, (excluding Employment Pass, or EP, holders). This will be reduced to 13% from 1 January 2020, and to 10% from 1 January 2021. Within the Services sector, Food Services has the highest utilisation of S Pass quota. S Pass holders also have to meet minimum qualifying salaries, which are regularly reviewed to reflect local salary changes. This is to ensure locals are not disadvantaged when their wages go up. We updated the S Pass salary criteria in 2019, with a further increase in S Pass qualifying salary to be made in 2020.While we do not subject firms to quotas on the number of EPs they may hire, we require them to consider all applicants fairly. Under the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF), we scrutinise the EP applications of firms suspected to have discriminatory hiring practices, including firms with very high single-nationality concentrations. Those found to have such practices will have their work pass privileges curtailed. Like S Pass holders, EP holders are subject to minimum qualifying salaries, which were updated in 2017.Locals hold the majority of jobs paying above $3,600 (minimum qualifying salary for EPs). In most other sectors, the EP shares are around or below one-quarter with the exception of Infocomm in the Services sector where the share of EPs is about one-third. These ratios may fluctuate but have not trended up in the last few years. Local employment outcomes – employment rates, unemployment rates, wage growth – have remained healthy. We continue to help local jobseekers expand opportunities for career mobility through a range of programmes.  "
amount of food waste generated in 2018 and progress on its segregation and treatment,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) in 2018, how much food waste has been generated by (i) residential households (ii) food industries (iii) food and beverage outlets (iv) markets and supermarkets and (v) other sources respectively; and (b) what is the progress for implementing food waste segregation and treatment in each of these sectors.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: In 2018, 763,000 tonnes of food waste was generated. Of this, half was from residential households. The remainder was from other sources, which includes food manufacturers, hotels, shopping malls and hawker centres. The National Environment Agency (NEA) does not track the specific amount of food waste generated from food industries, food and beverage outlets, markets and supermarkets. Food waste segregation and treatment for residential households are currently undertaken on a voluntary basis. From August to October last year, my Ministry conducted a household food waste segregation pilot at Tampines GreenLace. The initial results from the pilot were encouraging and more than 4000 kg of food waste was collected over three months. The pilot has been extended upon the request of residents and my Ministry is currently monitoring the extended pilot together with our partner Zero Waste SG. For commercial and industrial premises, 23 premises have obtained funding support through NEA's 3R Fund to install on-site food waste treatment systems. Another 23 premises have been segregating their food waste and sending it for treatment at the Ulu Pandan Water Reclamation Facility, where it is co-digested with used water sludge. From 2024, my Ministry will require commercial and industrial premises that generate large amounts of food waste to undertake food waste segregation for treatment. From 2021, developers of new developments where large amounts of food waste are expected to be generated will also be required to allocate space for on-site food waste treatment in their building plans. These regulations will be put into effect through the Resource Sustainability Bill that is to be introduced in Parliament.  "
amendment of employment of foreign manpower act to ensure clearer standards on well-being of foreign domestic workers,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act will be amended to ensure that there are clearer standards on the well-being of foreign domestic workers, namely (i) stipulated mandatory rest times (ii) setting out minimum amounts and quantity of food to be provided by employers and (iii) setting out minimum standards for foreign domestic workers' accommodation including that for shelter, amenities, ventilation, safety and privacy.","Mrs Josephine Teo: The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) stipulates provisions under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (EFMA) that safeguard the well-being and employment conditions of foreign domestic workers (FDWs). It requires employers to provide adequate food and rest, as well as proper accommodation with sufficient space and privacy for their FDWs.  Employers of FDWs receive clear guidelines on what constitute adequate food and acceptable accommodation, and these parameters are reflected on the MOM website. For instance, employers must provide FDWs with three meals a day and examples of what the daily food intake could be for breakfast, lunch and dinner are detailed on the MOM website. Employers are also responsible for providing proper lodging that accords adequate shelter, basic amenities, sufficient ventilation, space and privacy that safeguard their FDWs' safety and modesty. FDWs and employers are informed of these guidelines at the Settling-In Programme and Employer Orientation Programme respectively.As each household would have its own unique and varied needs for domestic work, it is not practical to stipulate fixed hours of rest and work for FDWs. For instance, a household with very young children or frail seniors may require greater attention from the FDW at different times of the day, while a household with teens and older adults may not. We encourage employers and FDWs to maintain open communication and work out arrangements that are agreeable to both parties.  "
support for professional conversion programme and measures to help companies and employees vulnerable to technology disruption,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the current number of companies that have actively supported the Professional Conversion Programme; and (b) what more can be done to help companies and employees who are vulnerable to technology disruption to actively upskill and reskill their employees.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: Since the launch of Adapt and Grow (A&G) initiative in 2016, more than 2,000 companies have partnered with Workforce Singapore to place more than 10,000 individuals through the Professional Conversion Programmes (PCPs). These PCPs provide training and salary support to employers who hire and reskill mid-career jobseekers for new PMET jobs. Currently, there are over 100 PCPs in about 30 sectors. We will continue to expand or develop new PCPs in growth sectors.Although some tasks within jobs can be performed by automation, few jobs can be fully automated by technology, in particular those that require flexibility, creativity and social interaction. While technology may reduce manpower reliance in some areas, technology can also create jobs of better quality.Where possible, it is better to intervene upstream before workers are retrenched. Workforce Singapore (WSG), together with the economic agencies, engages companies on their reorganisation plans and manpower needs to help them reskill and redeploy employees whose jobs are at risk, so that these employees can take on new job roles. Last year, about 1,300 at-risk workers were retrained for new job roles through re-deployment PCPs. WSG will make a bigger push in sectors that are restructuring. We will also press on with efforts to raise awareness of the A&G initiative and encourage companies to step forward to work with WSG."
regulation of food delivery companies,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether the Ministry regulates food delivery companies; and (b) how does the Ministry work with food delivery companies to ensure that food is delivered in accordance with food safety guidelines.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Food delivery companies are responsible for ensuring that the food they deliver is transported in a manner that does not compromise food safety. This includes maintaining the cleanliness of the vehicle, as well as the receptacle and equipment used for the transportation of food, and storing food at the correct temperature. Failure to do so would constitute an offence under the Sale of Food Act and the Environmental Public Health Act.To ensure food safety, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) has been engaging food delivery companies on the need to adopt good practices in food hygiene and safety. SFA will continue to monitor the industry closely and will tighten requirements to maintain food safety standards if this becomes necessary."
teaching of bahasa indonesia as optional module in institutions of higher education,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Education to what extent do Institutes of Higher Education (i) offer the teaching of Bahasa Indonesia as an optional module and (ii) facilitate exchange programmes and internships in Indonesia for such students.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: Our Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) offer a range of language programmes, including ASEAN languages such as Bahasa Melayu, Bahasa Indonesia, Thai, and Vietnamese. As Malay is one of our official languages, it is offered more widely in our IHLs – at four Universities and two Polytechnics. Bahasa Indonesia is available at the National University of Singapore and the Singapore University of Social Sciences as optional modules.Our IHLs also offer overseas exposure to various countries, including those in our region, to develop cross-cultural competencies in our students and help them appreciate the growing economic opportunities in our region.The IHLs send students to participate in exchanges and internships in Indonesia every year. Last year, 120 students went. We hope to increase this number over time as economic opportunities in Indonesia grow.   "
impact on singapore's economy from us treasury adding singapore to watch-list of currency manipulators,Mr Pritam Singh asked the Prime Minister what is the impact on Singapore's economy arising from the US Treasury adding Singapore to a watch-list of currency manipulators.,"Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): The United States (US) Treasury produces a semiannual report on the macroeconomic policies of the major trading partners of the United States. In its report published in May, the US Treasury included Singapore in a Monitoring List of trading partners that it deemed merited closer attention on their currency practices and macroeconomic policies.The US Treasury uses a generic set of criteria to determine the countries on its Monitoring List. The criteria include whether a country has a significant bilateral goods trade surplus with the US; a material overall current account surplus; or has in practice engaged in persistent one-sided interventions in the foreign exchange market. Singapore was assessed to have met the second and third criteria, and was therefore included in the Monitoring List.Singapore's inclusion in the Monitoring List does not affect the Monetary Authority of Singapore's (MAS) conduct of monetary policy. The countries in the List are not by that virtue deemed to be currency manipulators. The US Treasury has also acknowledged the uniqueness of Singapore's exchange-rate based monetary policy system. Its report points out that MAS manages the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER) within a policy band, just as other central banks conduct monetary policy by targeting interest rates. And similar to other central banks that target the interest rate, MAS manages the exchange rate to ensure low inflation. MAS has made it clear that it does not use the exchange rate to make Singapore's exports more competitive.MAS continues to be in constructive dialogue with the US Treasury to ensure that Singapore’s monetary policy framework including the role of foreign exchange intervention operations, are well-understood. MAS will continue to manage the S$NEER as appropriate, with the objective of ensuring medium-term price stability."
update on action against fraudulent websites and fake social media accounts using the names of singapore ministers,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Home Affairs with regard to fraudulent websites and fake social media accounts using the names of Singapore Ministers (a) whether the perpetrators have been caught; (b) what penalties will they face; and (c) what action is being taken against pages that are still active.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The Police review all reports of fraudulent websites and fake social media accounts using Singapore Ministers’ names. Perpetrators who use Ministers' names to defraud victims, such as by inducing investment of money through fake endorsements by the Ministers, will be liable to be charged for cheating offences. If convicted, they may be punished with imprisonment of up to 10 years and also a fine. Those who operate fraudulent websites and fake accounts using Ministers' names to cause nuisance may be investigated under the Protection from Harassment Act. If convicted of an offence of intentionally causing harassment, alarm or distress, they may face imprisonment of up to six months, or a fine of up to S$5,000, or both. Some of the perpetrators had been identified and prosecuted. For example, in 2016, the Police successfully traced and charged the perpetrator who impersonated Senior Minister of State, Dr Koh Poh Koon, to promote online courses in his name. The perpetrator was convicted for an offence of attempted cheating by personation and fined $4,000. Police work with other agencies, such as the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), to direct internet service providers in Singapore to disallow access to known fraudulent websites. Police also work with social media platforms to remove fraudulent accounts from their online platforms. While the MP has only asked about the fraudulent use of Singapore Ministers' names, Police also investigate other types of fraudulent conduct that are reported to them."
guidelines and regulations on availability of automated external defibrillators for commercial and residential properties and public buildings and areas,"Mr Darryl David asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether it is mandatory for all private buildings, including commercial and residential properties, to have sufficient and easily-accessible automated external defibrillators (AEDs) onsite and, if not, why not.","8 Mr Darryl David asked the Minister for Home Affairs what are the guidelines and regulations regarding the availability of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) in Government/public buildings and public areas.Mr K Shanmugam: It is not mandatory for building owners, whether private or public entities, to install AEDs within their premises. We do not assess that there is a need to make it mandatory at this point in time.Many buildings in Singapore are already equipped with AEDs such as schools, community centres, sports stadiums, bus interchanges, MRT stations, Singapore Armed Forces camps and Home Team facilities. Several commercial and office buildings have also installed AEDs.   Under the Save-A-Life (SAL) initiative, the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) has installed AEDs at the lift lobbies of HDB blocks in all 89 constituencies, with one AED for every two HDB blocks. SCDF is looking to expand its SAL initiative beyond HDB estates to condominiums. The SCDF is also working with the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Singapore Heart Foundation (SHF) to encourage more public and private establishments to install AEDs and register their publicly-accessible AEDs with the SHF, in order to build a national registry of publicly-accessible AEDs. SHF, in collaboration with SCDF and MOH, has also published on its website a set of best practice guidelines on the installation, registration and maintenance of AEDs."
number of foreign motorists summoned for not displaying vehicle plates properly and measures to ensure easy identification of foreign vehicles,"Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Transport (a) in the past three years, how many foreign motorists have been summoned by Singapore authorities for not displaying their vehicle licence plates properly; and (b) what are the measures carried out at the Singapore land checkpoints to ensure that foreign vehicles entering Singapore have licence plates that are properly displayed such as that requiring that the fonts to be sufficiently large, so that these vehicles can be easily identifiable.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Foreign vehicles entering Singapore are required to display licence plates in a manner which makes these vehicles easily identifiable. These requirements include being rectangular, mounted at specific positions on a vehicle, and not altered to cause characters to be less distinguishable.  Between July 2017 and May 2019, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) turned back over 2,200 foreign vehicles at our land checkpoints for failing to display their licence plates properly.  LTA is also developing an enhanced enforcement system with cameras, sensors and data analytics to better identify vehicles with improperly displayed licence plates. This will be deployed in the second half of 2020."
statistics of money laundering cases at both integrated resorts,"Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Minister for Home Affairs since the start of operation of the two integrated resorts, how many cases of money laundering at each of the two casinos have been (i) detected and investigated (ii) prosecuted and (iii) convicted annually.","Mr K Shanmugam: Since the casinos started operations in 2010, the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) has detected nine individuals who used criminal proceeds in the casinos. All nine individuals were prosecuted and convicted for money laundering offences.There is a robust framework to prevent money laundering in the casinos. The casino operators are required by the Casino Regulatory Authority to put safeguards in place, such as conducting customer due diligence and monitoring for suspicious transactions. In addition, we have tough penalties to deter money laundering. The Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crime (Confiscation of Benefits) Act criminalises the laundering of benefits derived from drug dealing and criminal conduct. Individuals convicted of money laundering offences are liable to a fine not exceeding S$500,000 and/or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 10 years."
action taken against singaporean drivers who change their car licence plates when entering malaysia,"Mr Darryl David asked the Minister for Transport what action can be taken against Singaporean drivers who change their car licence plates when they enter Malaysia, especially when their actions have adverse or detrimental effects on other Singaporean drivers whose licence plates have been copied.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: If the swapping of number plates is done outside Singapore, whether it is an offence will depend on the facts of the case. For instance, if the driver is also found to be in possession of the false plate with the intention to deceive in Singapore, the driver may be punished with a fine of up to $5,000 and/or a jail sentence of up to 12 months. We would be happy to share information, to the extent permitted by our laws, with our foreign counterparts to assist with investigations into any other possible offences under foreign laws. It is an offence to display false number plates in Singapore. Anyone found doing so may be punished with a fine of up to $5,000 and/or a jail sentence of up to 12 months. "
reasons for delaying decision on licences for shared-pmd operators,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for Transport (a) what are the safety concerns that LTA has for delaying the decision on which companies can operate shared-PMDs; and (b) what are the additional requirements that LTA intends to impose on licensees to allay these safety concerns.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The award of PMD-sharing licences has been deferred to later this year as the Land Transport Authority (LTA) requires more time to review the imposition of additional requirements on licensees to ensure the safety of users and the general public. The requirements being considered include requiring shared PMDs to be certified to the UL2272 standard to ensure fire safety, and to be insured against third-party claims on bodily injury or death. LTA will also start conservatively, restricting sandbox licensees to small fleet sizes over a 1-year sandbox period."
update on formation of electoral boundaries review committee,"Mr Pritam Singh asked the Prime Minister (a) whether he can provide an update on whether the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee (EBRC) has been formed; and (b) if not, when he intends to establish the EBRC.",Mr Chan Chun Sing (for the Prime Minister): The Prime Minister has not yet appointed the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee.
number of successful first-time applicants in bto and sale of balance flats exercise in past two years,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development (a) in each of the past two years, how many first-timer applicants have successfully secured their HDB flats from Built-To-Order (BTO) and Sale of Balance Flats (SBF) exercises on (i) first attempt (ii) second attempt (iii) third attempt (iv) fourth attempt (v) fifth attempt and beyond; and (b) how effective has the present measure of additional ballot chances for each failed attempt been in assisting first-timer applicants to secure their flat.","Mr Lawrence Wong: The details of first-timer (FT) families who have been successful in the Build-To-Order (BTO) and Sale of Balance Flats (SBF) exercises launched in the past two years are tabulated below.FT families who are not invited to book a flat after two attempts for a BTO flat in the non-mature estates will be given an additional ballot chance for their subsequent applications for a BTO flat in the non-mature estates. Over the past two years, among the FT families who applied for a BTO flat in the non-mature estates, all have been successful by their third attempt."
number of single unwed parents under 35 years old applying to buy a flat from hdb in past five years,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for National Development for each year in the past five years (a) how many single unwed parents under 35 years old applied to buy a flat from HDB; (b) how many of such single unwed parents obtained a ballot number without submitting an appeal; and (c) how many of such single unwed parents obtained a ballot number following an appeal.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Since 2014, we have received 121 requests from single unwed parents to apply for a 2-room Flexi flat before they turn 35 years old. The individual circumstances of each person were reviewed to understand their housing options and level of family support. 28 of them were granted flexibility to submit an application to buy a flat. The rest were assessed to be able to stay with family members. After a flat application has been submitted, HDB uses a computer ballot to determine the queue order among the flat applicants.The annual figures from 2014 to May 2019 are in Table 1:We will continue to review every request holistically, with input from social workers where needed, to provide housing assistance to single unwed parents and their children."
applications from single unwed parents for hdb flat under public rental scheme in past five years,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for National Development for each year in the past five years (a) how many single unwed parents applied for a HDB flat under the Public Rental Scheme; (b) how many of such single unwed parents were allocated a flat without submitting an appeal; and (c) how many of such single unwed parents were allocated a flat following an appeal.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Since 2014, we have received 1,014 requests from single unwed parents to rent a public rental flat. The individual circumstances of each person were reviewed to understand their housing options and level of family support. 380 single unwed parents were successful in their application for a rental flat. The rest were assessed to be able to stay with family or afford alternative housing options.The annual figures from 2014 to May 2019 are in Table 1. We will continue to review every request holistically, with input from social workers where needed, to provide housing assistance to single unwed parents and their children."
engagement and outreach activities conducted by cyber security agency,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) what are the engagement and outreach activities conducted by the Cyber Security Agency since its creation in 2015; (b) what is the target audience of the agency's public outreach programmes; and (c) whether there are plans to increase the agency's public outreach programmes in light of the recent string of cybersecurity-related incidents.,"Mr S Iswaran: In cyberspace, our defences are only as strong as our weakest link. Cybersecurity is hence a collective responsibility shared by the Government, private sector, individuals and the community.To enable this, the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) has conducted various targeted engagement and outreach efforts to members of the public, enterprises and students, to promote cybersecurity awareness and the adoption of good cybersecurity practices.Every year, CSA runs nationwide cybersecurity awareness campaigns to highlight the importance of cybersecurity, and provide cyber hygiene tips. These include conducting roadshows in the heartlands, and talks in schools and community centres. The 2018 cybersecurity awareness campaign, called ""Cyber Tips 4 You"", promoted four cyber hygiene practices: (1) use a strong password and two-factor authentication; (2) use antivirus software; (3) update software as soon as possible; and (4) watch out for signs of phishing.In addition, a Cyber Savvy vending machine has been making its rounds at the public libraries since November 2018. Library-goers can learn about good cybersecurity practices and win a small gift by attempting a quiz. More than 60,000 quiz attempts have been recorded so far. CSA will deploy more machines for outreach in community, commercial and school settings.The Singapore Computer Emergency Response Team (SingCERT) also issues advisories to alert the public and enterprises on cyber threats, and provides advice on remediation and preventive measures. Members of the public and enterprises can sign-up for advisories at www.csa.gov.sg/singcert.   Specific to enterprises, CSA has developed publicly available cybersecurity resources, such as the Be Safe Online Handbook, which outlines steps that enterprises should take to strengthen their cyber defences and enhance digital risk management.School-going youth are also an important target group, to establish good cyber hygiene practices from an early age. For example, CSA has collaborated with the Personal Data Protection Commission to produce a series of Cyber Safety activity books, which has benefited four cohorts of Primary 5 students, with more than 200,000 copies distributed. Also, with the support of the Ministry of Education, CSA has developed a Cybersecurity Awareness Skit, which is expected to reach about 24,000 students at close to 40 secondary schools.Even as the Government continues to do more to create a safer cyberspace, organisations and individuals must take responsibility for their own cybersecurity. Everyone has a part to play in safeguarding our digital domain."
outcome of measures to reduce emphasis on exam-centred grading,"Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Education (a) what is being done to reduce the emphasis on exam-centered grading and what has been the effect of these changes thus far; and (b) what is being done to emphasise character development, life skills and the joy of learning through interest-based learning, learning through fun or outside-classroom learning instead.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: Examinations continue to be important as it inculcates hard work and discipline amongst our students. However, it cannot be over-emphasised to the extent that it undermines the holistic development of children, and douses their curiosity to learn. This is why MOE undertook significant efforts to change the scoring system of PSLE, reduce school-based assessment load and modify the format of the school report card to move away from an over-emphasis on academic results. By 2021, schools will be removing the mid-year examinations at Primary 3, Primary 5, Secondary 1 and Secondary 3. This reduces assessment load at those levels by 25% and provides more time and space for engaged learning to take place.Starting from this year, we have also removed all tests and examinations for Primary 1 and Primary 2, and require schools to conduct no more than one test per subject per school term for Primary 3 to Secondary 5. School report cards will no longer indicate class and level positions to reduce over-emphasis on peer comparison.Some schools have decided to implement these changes earlier than scheduled. By 2020, more than half of our Primary schools would have removed Primary 3 and Primary 5 mid-year examinations, and more than 90% of Secondary schools would be removing their Secondary 3 mid-year examinations, one year ahead of schedule.It is too early to conclude on their impact. The feedback we received is that educators and parents see the value of such adjustments, and support the direction of the move.These changes to school-based assessment load complement a broader set of efforts to develop our students more holistically. Character and Citizenship Education continues to be a big part of a student's school life. Co-Curricular Activities remain integral to the school programme. In addition, the Applied Learning Programme and Learning for Life Programme in schools enable our students to apply learning in real-world settings, and develop stronger life skills and socio-emotional competencies. Values in Action programme and outdoor adventure camps are also important platforms for character development and nurturing of 21st century competences.Add together, these programmes ensure that a large part of the curriculum is devoted to authentic learning opportunities to discover new interests and develop character in our students."
trend of mosquito breeding by households and commercial entities over last three years,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources over the last three years (a) what has been the trend of mosquito breeding by households and commercial entities; (b) how many cases of repeat offenders have there been; and (c) whether the current level of enforcement and severity of punishment are sufficient to deter offenders and better prevent the spread of dengue.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Between January and May 2019, the National Environment Agency (NEA) conducted more than 372,000 inspections which uncovered about 6,500 instances of mosquito breeding. About 900 enforcement actions were taken against households, including three repeat offenders. Another 950 enforcement actions were taken against other premises, which include construction sites and commercial premises. The total number of enforcement actions taken for mosquito breeding has generally increased between 2016 and 2018. To safeguard public health, NEA will not hesitate to take enforcement action against anyone found to be breeding mosquitoes. NEA last reviewed the penalty regime in 2016 to impose a fine on all households detected with mosquito breeding, and not just those found with breeding within active dengue clusters. Under the Control of Vectors and Pesticides Act, owners whose premises are found with mosquito breeding may be fined up to $5,000 or imprisoned for a term not exceeding three months or both, with heavier penalties for subsequent convictions. NEA will monitor the enhanced regime to ensure that the penalties for mosquito breeding are appropriate and have sufficient deterrent effect."
measures to increase awareness of vertical gardens in singapore,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for National Development what can be done to increase awareness of vertical gardens in Singapore such as to increase greenery in residential areas and industrial spaces and to enhance the number of green hobbyists and enthusiasts in Singapore.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: NParks provides financial incentives through its Skyrise Greenery Incentive Scheme to encourage building owners to incorporate skyrise greenery, including rooftop and vertical gardens, into their buildings. NParks also gives out Skyrise Greenery Awards to recognise organisations that have implemented well-designed skyrise greenery. Where public sector developments are concerned, Housing and Development Board (HDB) and Jurong Town Corporation (JTC) will do their part to ensure that skyrise greenery is well-integrated in residential and industrial developments. In our public housing estates, skyrise greenery is implemented in common areas such as rooftops of multi-storey carparks, landscape decks linking residential blocks, as well as intermediate sky terraces. In industrial estates, there are roof gardens, mid-level communal sky terraces, balcony planters and landscape decks. Taken together, these measures have led to an increase in skyrise greenery, from less than 30 hectares to more than 110 hectares over the last decade. NParks also engages volunteers to help manage these green spaces through its Community in Bloom programme. Government agencies will continue to work together to raise awareness of and facilitate the implementation of skyrise greenery."
number and percentage of singaporeans in latest 10 cohorts with bachelor's degrees from local and overseas universities,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Education what is the number and percentage of Singaporeans respectively in the latest 10 cohorts being tracked who have obtained bachelor's degrees from public universities, private universities and overseas universities.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: The Government has increased the number of subsidised university places in our Autonomous Universities (AUs) over the years to support the economy while maintaining good graduate employment outcomes. Between 2010 and 2019, we have raised the Cohort Participation Rate (CPR)1 in the AUs from 26% to close to 40%. Between 2014 and 2018, the annual number of Singaporeans who were admitted into full-time External Degree Programmes at Private Education Institutes has decreased from around 8,200 to 6,100. We should note that these institutes also cater to Singaporeans who were already in the workforce and seek to upgrade their academic qualifications.However, MOE is unable to track the number of Singaporeans who have obtained bachelor's degrees from overseas universities."
amount budgeted for cost of home improvement programme for hougang smc for completed and upcoming works,"Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the cost of the Home Improvement Programme (HIP) budgeted for Hougang SMC, both for completed and upcoming works; and (b) when will town councils be invited to nominate flats built between 1987 and 1997 for the enhanced HIP announced in August 2018.","Mr Lawrence Wong: The amount budgeted under the Home Improvement Programme (HIP) for the flats in Hougang SMC that have been selected for upgrading thus far is about $160 million. As for flats built between 1987 and 1997, they will be selected for HIP from next year onwards. Town Councils will be invited to submit their nominations in due course."
programmes to help at-risk youths,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Social and Family Development what are the programmes to help (i) youths who are at risk of under-performing academically or transitioning successfully into adulthood due to socio-economic or familial circumstances and (ii) at-risk youths who come from multi-problem families.,"Mr Desmond Lee: We recognise that youths-at-risk often face multiple stressors, including weak family support, negative peer influence and financial difficulty.Since 2018, MSF has appointed nine Social Service Agencies to run a suite of programmes aimed at addressing different at-risk behaviours. For example, a core programme is the Enhanced STEP-UP, which helps youths who are either at risk of dropping out or have stopped attending school, to continue their education or acquire work skills and employment. It provides individual casework and counselling to address specific risks and needs of our youths. Recognising that youths-at-risk do not naturally seek centre-based help, MSF has appointed two Social Service Agencies since 2012 to run the Youth GO! Programme. Youth workers do street outreach and build a social relationship with the youths before moving on to case management or deeper engagement through interest-based activities. The interest-based activities engage the youths constructively and provide an alternative to youths’ negative activities.MOE has also established the Uplifting Pupils in Life and Inspiring Families Taskforce (UPLIFT) to strengthen upstream support for students from disadvantaged families, such as by enhancing after-school engagement programmes. The programmes seek to improve the students' connectedness to school, community and peers, and strengthen their motivation and resilience.  It is not uncommon that at-risk youths are in families that face multiple challenges. Family Service Centres work with such families to address a range of issues, to ensure that both the youths and their family members receive support that is timely and effective.As announced at MSF's Committee of Supply debate earlier this year, MSF is piloting a Localised Community Network (LCN) in Jurong West. The pilot will enable relevant Government agencies to pull together data and identify at-risk youths early, and coordinate agencies and partners in the local community to more seamlessly serve the youths and their families.MSF will continue to partner other Ministries and Social Service Agencies to provide convenient, comprehensive and coordinated social services, so that all youths have the opportunity to develop to their full potential."
calculation of monthly cpf payouts from cpf life or retirement sum scheme,"Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry asked the Minister for Manpower whether the CPF Board can share with the public how the monthly CPF payouts from CPF Life or the Retirement Sum Scheme are calculated as well as the assumptions in determining the payouts, through publication of guidelines and online calculators.","Mrs Josephine Teo: CPF members receive monthly retirement payouts through CPF LIFE or the Retirement Sum Scheme (RSS). Members born in or after 1958 will automatically be included in CPF LIFE if they have at least $60,000 in their Retirement Account (RA) when they turn 65. All other members1 will continue to be on the RSS, unless they voluntarily opt to join CPF LIFE.  RSS payouts are designed to last up to 20 years taking into account the base interest rate on RA savings, which is now 4%. The CPF Extra Interest (EI) and Additional Extra Interest (AEI) provided by the Government are used to extend the RSS payout duration beyond 20 years. In this way, members enjoy payouts for a longer duration and there is less risk that their savings will run out. The period of extension depends on the member's base payout amount, but does not go beyond 10 years.   Unlike the RSS, CPF LIFE is designed to provide lifelong payouts. The payout depends principally on how much a member puts into CPF LIFE. An independent actuarial consultant appointed by the CPF Board determines the payouts taking into account factors such as mortality rates and interest earned on the amounts committed to CPF LIFE. Payouts are reviewed annually to account for changes in these factors. For example, if more people live longer than expected, the monthly payouts may decrease and vice versa. Any adjustment is expected to be small and gradual, and affected members are informed ahead of the adjustment. Members who wish to estimate their payouts can use the CPF LIFE estimator on the CPF website. They may also visit any of the five service centres to find out more."
"proportion of workforce given one-year, two-year and three-year re-employment contracts at point of retirement","Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the proportion of the workforce given one-year, two-year and three-year re-employment contracts at the point of retirement; (b) what is the proportion of the re-employed workforce being able to work till 67 years old; and (c) what is the number of companies that have re-designed their jobs to support the ageing workforce.","Mrs Josephine Teo: Upon reaching the minimum statutory retirement age of 62 every year, well over 90% of private-sector local employees who are eligible and want to continue working are offered re-employment. Two-thirds could continue on their existing contracts without a specified end date. The remainder were offered re-employment on new contracts; in about one-third of these cases, the contract duration was more than one year. The rates of re-employment for eligible workers at older ages i.e. 63 to 67 have also remained consistently high at well over 90%. The Government’s WorkPro Job Redesign Grant encourages companies to redesign jobs for their senior workers. Since the Grant was started in 2013, over 1,800 companies employing about 20,000 senior workers have benefited from the Grant and redesigned their jobs.  Even without applying for grants, progressive companies may implement age-friendly practices. More than 10,000 companies, employing about 277,000 of the 318,000 (87%) local employees aged 50 & over, reported that they have done so, including job redesign1."
breakdown of median monthly income of employed residents in last five years,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Manpower in the last five years (a) what is the median monthly income of employed residents by marital status, gender, and age group; and (b) what is the median monthly income of employed residents by number of children, gender, and age group.","Mrs Josephine Teo: The breakdown of median gross monthly income of full-time employed residents by sex, age and marital status is provided in Table 1. Married males earned more than single males across all age groups, whereas single females aged 30 and above earned more than married females of the same age group. Among singles of the same age group, women earned more than men; while among those married of the same age group, men earned more than women. Table 2 provides the breakdown of median gross monthly income of full-time employed female residents by age and the number of children given birth to. We do not collect such data for males. Among women aged 30 and above with children, those with two children tended to earn more than those with just one child or three or more children in the same age group. It is not straightforward to compare to those with no children as they include both single and married women. Data alone cannot establish the causal impact on income of marital status and number of children; as these factors can themselves be influenced by income and education levels. There are also generational differences, for example, in age of marriage, rates of divorce, and the division of caregiving and household responsibilities between married couples. Finally, the data does not account for differences in occupations between men and women, and in preferences for part-time work, which could also affect incomes."
update on investigation into breach of singapore red cross website and remedial actions taken,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) whether he can provide an update on the investigation into the hacking of the Singapore Red Cross website; (b) whether it is mandatory for VWOs and NGOs to comply with the IT security guidelines established by the Government; and (c) whether there are plans to equip VWOs and NGOs with the capability to establish resilient IT security frameworks to safeguard confidential data.,"Mr S Iswaran: On 8 May 2019, the Police and the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) were informed of a ransomware incident on the Singapore Red Cross's (SRC) blood donor database. The database contained the details of about 4,300 donors who booked appointments to donate blood via SRC's webpage, including their name, contact number and email address.According to SRC, its investigations have found that the perpetrator exploited a weak administrator password that left the webpage vulnerable to unauthorised access. Nevertheless, investigations by the Police and the PDPC are ongoing.Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs) such as SRC are non-governmental organisations (NGOs) that provide services that benefit the community, and hold data about donors, volunteers and beneficiaries. It is therefore important that NGOs put in place the necessary data protection and cybersecurity safeguards to maintain the confidentiality of such data.While NGOs do not need to comply with Government IT security guidelines, there are national-level and sector-level frameworks and resources to assist them in enhancing the protection of their systems and data.At the national-level, all private sector organisations, including NGOs, are subject to requirements under the Personal Data Protection Act. The PDPC also provides such organisations with guidelines and guides on how to comply with their data protection obligations. Examples include the guides issued by the PDPC and the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) to assist organisations in securing personal data on electronic medium and managing data breaches.To help organisations including NGOs improve their cybersecurity posture, CSA enhances cybersecurity awareness and promotes good cybersecurity practices through channels such as the GoSafeOnline portal (www.csa.gov.sg/gosafeonline) and the Singapore Computer Emergency Response Team's (SingCERT's) portal (www.csa.gov.sg/singcert).At the VWO sector-level, agencies such as the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) and the Office of the Commissioner of the Charities (COC) play an important role in building up capabilities among VWOs, to protect confidential data and mitigate cybersecurity risks. For example, some VWOs that administer programmes that are funded by MSF use an integrated case management system that protects clients’ data in accordance to Government IT security policies; while COC is working with potential partners to provide subsidised IT security audit services for charities, including VWOs.The Government is committed to help NGOs such as VWOs establish resilient IT security frameworks to safeguard confidential data. NGOs and their senior leadership must also play their part to ensure that the risks in relation to data protection and cybersecurity are adequately addressed. This is necessary so that they can continue to uphold the high level of trust and confidence that their stakeholders have placed in them."
efficacy of home access programme and neu pc plus programme in helping low-income families in adoption and use of digital technology,Prof Lim Sun Sun asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) how does the Ministry assess the efficacy of the Home Access Programme that provides subsidised broadband access to low-income families; and (b) whether these families are tracked in terms of their technology adoption and digital literacy skills and challenges.,"18 Prof Lim Sun Sun asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) how does the Ministry assess the efficacy of the NEU PC Plus Programme that provides subsidised personal computer/laptop ownership to low income families; and (b) whether these families' technology usage patterns and digital literacy skills are tracked.Mr S Iswaran: The Home Access Programme and NEU PC Plus Programme are programmes by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) to support low-income households to have access to and use digital technologies.The Home Access Programme provides two years of subsidised broadband to the bottom 10% of households without school-going children. More than 12,000 households have benefited from the programme since September 2014, contributing to 98%1 of resident households having internet access at home. In a survey conducted in 2016, 9 in 10 households indicated that they have benefited from the programme, and 7 in 10 stated that they were excited to try out new technology and were confident in using the internet. Another round of survey is being conducted this year.The NEU PC Plus Programme provides a subsidised PC with three years of free broadband to the bottom 20% of households with school-going children or with persons with disabilities. More than 40,000 low-income households have benefited from the programme since November 2006, contributing to 98%2 of resident households with school-going children having computer access at home. 9 in 10 households indicated in a 2018 survey that the programme has benefited them. 7 in 10 primary school students and 8 in 10 secondary school students also shared that the programme has aided their learning process and helped them to complete their school work independently.Beyond the provision of broadband access and PCs, there is also a need to equip individuals with digital literacy skills. To support this need, beneficiaries of the Home Access Programme are offered introductory training to acquire basic digital skills. Additional digital literacy skilling support is also provided through initiatives such as the Silver Infocomm Junctions, as well as Digital Clinics. Our support programmes are regularly refined to keep up with needs of low-income families."
proportion of patients receiving services from more than one medifund-approved institution,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Health in each of the last three years (a) what proportion of patients receive services from more than one Medifund-approved institution (MFI); (b) what is the average number of different MFIs that patients receive services from; (c) what is the proportion of patients who applied for MediFund at more than one MFI; (d) for such patients, what is the average number of MFIs where MediFund applications are made; and (e) what are the costs incurred by MFIs to assess MediFund applications.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: There are currently 149 Medifund-approved institutions (MFI), spanning all healthcare settings including public acute and community hospitals, specialist outpatient clinics, polyclinics, and Government-subsidised nursing homes. Over each of the last three years, close to half of subsidised patients received services at more than one MFI, most of whom visited two MFIs each year. 1% of subsidised patients received MediFund assistance at more than one MFI, most of whom received assistance at two MFIs each year. Each MFI has an independent MediFund Committee, made up of representatives such as community leaders and professionals, to assess MediFund applications. They are typically supported by Medical Social Worker (MSWs) and other staff who help assess a patient's circumstances. Apart from assessing MediFund applications, MSWs also serve a wider group of patients and caregivers, such as extending social and emotional support and making referrals to other social services or assistance schemes. For this reason, MFIs are unable to determine specifically the cost of processing MediFund applications alone.   We periodically review MediFund processes to improve and streamline them where possible. For instance, needy patients on Public Assistance today do not need to undergo further MediFund assessment at MFIs. We are also in the midst of rolling out system enhancements, led by our MSWs, that will streamline the application process and improve information sharing. This will make it more convenient for MediFund patients who visit more than one institution."
extension of medisave to cover more chronic severe skin conditions,Ms Tin Pei Ling asked the Minister for Health whether the use of MediSave can be extended to cover more chronic severe skin conditions other than psoriasis.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Under the Chronic Disease Management Programme (CDMP), MediSave can be used to reduce the out-of-pocket costs for outpatient treatment of chronic conditions. The conditions covered are selected in consultation with a Clinical Advisory Committee comprising clinical experts. The factors considered include level of disease burden, effectiveness of early intervention, and availability of clear clinical guidelines. The conditions covered under CDMP are reviewed on a periodic basis as new information and evidence emerge. In June 2018 for example, ischaemic heart disease and pre-diabetes were added to the list of CDMP-approved chronic conditions. We will continue to periodically review the list of supportable conditions, including chronic skin conditions, to meet the needs of Singaporeans, while ensuring that MediSave balances are not prematurely depleted. Beyond the CDMP, other support for treatment of chronic conditions, including subsidies for different chronic skin conditions, are widely available for all Singaporeans at Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) GP clinics, polyclinics and where the condition is serious, subsidised specialist outpatient clinics. Singaporeans aged 60 and above can also tap on Flexi-MediSave to defray their out-of-pocket costs for outpatient treatments.  Singaporeans who still face difficulties managing their medical bills can also approach the Medical Social Workers at our public institutions for assistance."
update on community volunteer police force scheme enrolment,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) how many residents have joined the community volunteer police force to help maintain community security since the scheme was launched; and (b) what are the plans to encourage more residents to join the scheme.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The Volunteer Special Constabulary (VSC) has about 1,000 officers. VSC officers perform frontline policing roles alongside regular officers, and are required to serve a minimum of 16 hours each month. To prepare them, VSCs undergo six months of training. To create more opportunities for the public to volunteer with the Police, a new vocation under the VSC, known as the Volunteer Special Constabulary (Community) [VSCC], was launched on 13 April 2018. VSCC officers are deployed in the community to project Police presence in areas with high human traffic, among other roles. Compared to VSC officers, VSCC officers serve a lower minimum monthly commitment of eight hours, and can be deployed after completing a shorter training of nine weeks. Today, we have more than 140 trained VSCC officers, and more are currently undergoing training. Recruitment for both VSC and VSCC is done on a regular basis. For example, recruitment roadshows are held regularly in the community, such as at community events, shopping malls, and Institutes of Higher Learning. Later this year, the Police will launch a volunteer recruitment publicity drive to create more awareness of the various volunteering opportunities."
number and ratio of medical social workers and aic care co-ordinators to population of care recipients over age 65,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Health what is the current number of (i) medical social workers and (ii) AIC care co-ordinators, and their respective ratios to the population of care recipients over the age of 65 years.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Based on data reported by healthcare providers, there were about 600 Medical Social Workers (MSWs) working in the public healthcare and community care sectors1 in 2018. Within the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC), there are about 110 staff coordinating care for care recipients and their caregivers in hospitals and in the community, and helping them with information and referral to the various services and support programmes. The ratio of MSWs and AIC staff numbers to the population of care recipients over the age of 65 years may not be meaningful as they work together to support care recipients across all age groups, and not just care recipients over the age of 65 years. They also work with other community partners to coordinate care and support for seniors."
"timeframe from final appellate court decision to date of hanging, and timing of notification of clemency outcome and execution date to petitioner","Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) where persons are sentenced to death, what is the median and average time frame from the final appellate court decision to the date of hanging; (b) where a clemency petition is filed with the President's Office, whether there are guidelines as to the time within which Cabinet advice should be rendered to the President and for the President's Office to reply to the petitioner; and (c) whether it is usual for the prisoner and his family to receive both the reply from President's Office on clemency and the notice of the execution date from the Prisons Service at the same time.","Mr K Shanmugam: The median and average time from the final appellate court decision to the date of execution is around one year, for executions in recent years. Each clemency petition is carefully considered on its own merits. There is no expressly stipulated timeline by which Cabinet's advice should be rendered to the President or by which the President's Office should reply to the petitioner. The Member asked about the timing of the notification of the clemency outcome and the notification of the execution date. It has been the procedure for a prisoner and his family to receive both the notification of the clemency outcome from the President's Office and the notification of the execution date from the Singapore Prison Service at the same time since 2016. Following a consideration of the Court of Appeal's decision in CA/CM 6/2019, we are reviewing the procedure, in particular to notify the prisoner and the petitioner of the clemency outcome some time in advance of the notification of the execution date."
statistics on permanent residency applications by non-singaporean spouses over last 10 years,"Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for Home Affairs for each year over the last 10 years (a) how many non-Singaporean spouses have applied for permanent residency (PR) and how many applications have been approved; and (b) which specific Asian and non-Asian countries are the successful applicants from, expressed as a percentage of the successful applicants.","Mr K Shanmugam: From 2009 to 2018, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority received an average of about 8,600 applications each year for permanent residency (PR) from foreign spouses of Singapore citizens. Of these applicants, an average of about 4,200 were granted PR each year. The average success rate was around 49%. 45% of the successful applicants were from Southeast Asian countries, another 45% were from other Asian countries, and the remainder were from non-Asian countries."
use of whatsapp by health institutions to communicate medical information and records to patients,"Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Health (a) whether any of our public health institutions use WhatsApp to communicate medical information and records to their patients; and (b) if so, what has been done to protect the patients' information in view of the recent WhatsApp security breach.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Public healthcare institutions do not allow their staff to use platforms such as Whatsapp to communicate sensitive medical information to patients. Instead, they are encouraged to do so at face-to-face consultations, and the Cluster CIOs have been asked to remind users of this. For selected medical information, patients can also log on to HealthHub via the secure Singpass platform to view the information. "
fatality and injury rates for working at heights in past five years,"Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Manpower (a) for the past five years, what are the fatality and injury rates respectively for working at heights; (b) which are the sectors most prone to such risk; and (c) what actions is the Ministry taking to prevent accidents from working at heights.","Mrs Josephine Teo:  Both fatal and non-fatal falls from height injury rates have declined from 2014 to 2018. Fatal injuries declined from 0.3 per 100,000 workers in 2014 to 0.2 in 2018. Non-fatal injuries declined from 23 per 100,000 workers to 19 in the same period.   The sector most prone to falls from height injury risks is construction, followed by marine and manufacturing.Sustained enforcement and engagement efforts in the construction, marine and manufacturing sectors have contributed to the declining injury rates. Falls from height risk is a primary focus in MOM inspections. The Workplace Safety and Health Council (WSHC) has also rolled out outreach programmes to educate companies and workers on how to prevent falls from height risk. These included the ""Target Zero Falls"" Campaign last November, where over 150 companies pledged their support and conducted ""Safety Time Outs"" for their management to review work-at-heights activities. Companies will also be able to tap on free WSH consultancy services on how to prevent falls from height and other workplace risks, under the WSHC's Safety Compliance Assistance Visits (SCAV+) programme."
number of commercial divers who had suffered accidents and death on job in past five years,"Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Manpower (a) in the past five years, how many commercial divers have suffered accidents and death on the job; and (b) what is being done to ensure that commercial diving companies comply with the industry's training guidelines and framework for the safety of their divers.","Mrs Josephine Teo: From 2014 to 2018, there were 20 non-fatal and three fatal workplace accidents involving commercial diving. The numbers are similar in the preceding five-year period. In 2018, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) stepped up inspections on commercial diving activities at Anchorage Waters, with the support of the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA). The inspections focused on ensuring that diving companies have competent divers, proper risk assessment and planning prior to diving operations. Through these inspections, we have taken enforcement actions against 10 companies for safety lapses.The Workplace Safety and Health Council (WSHC) is working with the diving community to update the commercial diving training curriculum and the Diving Technical Advisory for Inland/Inshore Commercial Diving Safety and Health. It has also stepped up engagements with diving companies, to drive home the message that it is their responsibility to ensure all their contracted divers are properly trained."
outreach efforts to freelancers and self-employed persons below 35 to create awareness about career opportunities and progression,Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Manpower what are the existing efforts in reaching out to younger freelancers and self-employed persons who are below the age of 35 to create awareness about opportunities for career progression.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: Over the past decade, the share of those who did self-employed work as their main job, that is, primary self-employed persons (SEPs)1, remained stable at 8% to 10% of our resident workforce. In 2018, 17% of primary SEPs were aged below 35. In comparison, 31% of regular employees were aged below 35. Youths below 35 are therefore not over-represented among the self-employed. Young Singaporeans have opportunities to learn about various occupations starting from school. In particular, the Institute of Technical Education (ITE), Polytechnics and Universities provide education and career guidance (ECG) to help students make better-informed choices as they transit into the workforce. These efforts include learning journeys to companies, workshops with industry representatives, and career fairs. Also, with the support of ITE and Polytechnics, Workforce Singapore piloted its Career Starter Programme early this year for graduating students. Complementing these efforts are the MySkillsFuture Portal and the MyCareersFuture Portal. The MySkillsFuture Portal is a key resource for all workers, including SEPs, to easily access information on industries and occupations, as well as tools to support their training and career development. The MyCareersFuture Portal enables SEPs who seek career progression via regular employment to locate suitable jobs more easily.The Ministry of Manpower is also working with our tripartite partners and other Government agencies to raise awareness about skills training for SEPs. For example, since 2016, the National Trades Union Congress' Freelancers and Self-Employed Unit (U FSE) has hosted annual Freelancers Fairs. Besides providing useful information, such fairs highlight opportunities for skills training for SEPs. Sector agencies also provide training support to SEPs. For example, insurance agents can tap on industry competency standards and training subsidies under the Institute of Banking and Finance to acquire expertise in financial planning and future-enabled skills. Media freelancers and professionals may refer to the Skills Framework for Media, which is a useful guide on job roles, skills required and possible career pathways. The Infocomm Media and Development Authority (IMDA) also provides funding support to SEPs, in particular media freelancers, to encourage them to acquire deeper skills and competencies through a list of pre-approved courses. In addition, in occupations, such as insurance and real estate agents, SEPs are required to go for regular training and assessment to maintain their professional qualifications. The Ministry encourages individuals, including young persons, to tap on these efforts and initiatives to find out more about the prospects for career development in their desired occupations."
total government spending on scholarships and other financial aid to foreign students in singapore schools and universities in past five years,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Education in each of the past five years, what is the total Government spending on scholarships and other forms of financial aid given to foreign students studying in Singapore schools and universities.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: In general, international students receive less funding than local students, and most of MOE’s spending goes to supporting the education of Singapore Citizens. Government-funded financial assistance at our schools and government-funded bursaries at our post-secondary education institutions are for Singapore Citizens only.The Government does give out a small number of scholarships for international students in our schools and Autonomous Universities. The total Government spending for this group of international students comes up to around $130 million a year, which is one percent of MOE's annual budget of $13 billion. For those international students on scholarships, their academic performance is closely monitored every semester, and the scholarship would be withdrawn if the scholar’s performance is not satisfactory. Additionally, international students on scholarships at the Autonomous Universities are also obliged to work in a Singapore entity for up to six years after graduation. Some of these international students eventually apply for and are granted Permanent Residency, and some may also take up citizenship.Every education system in the world will provide some support to international students, and Singaporeans are also benefiting from foreign sponsorships for their studies. This is the norm amongst the international network of education systems. "
recruitment of tourists as volunteers to care for dogs by pet boarding services,"Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Manpower in view of recent reports where tourists have been recruited by pet boarding services as volunteers to care for dogs in exchange for accommodation, meals and other benefits (a) how many of such cases have been reported to the Ministry in the past one year; and (b) whether actions have been taken against the tourists and the companies which recruited these tourists.","Mrs Josephine Teo: It is illegal for tourists to work in Singapore without a valid work pass. This is regardless of whether they receive remuneration in cash or in kind. The Ministry has found only one case where a company paid tourists in kind to work. The investigation is currently on-going. Under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act, foreigners found working illegally can be fined a maximum of $20,000, or subjected to imprisonment of up to two years, or both. For hiring foreigners without a valid work pass, employers can be fined a maximum of $30,000, or subjected to imprisonment of up to one year, or both."
penalties for foreign domestic workers who give false information or accuse employers wrongly,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what are the penalties for foreign domestic workers who give false information or accuse employers wrongly; and (b) how many of such complaints has the Ministry received in the past three years.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) takes all complaints seriously, whether they are made by an employer or an Foreign Domestic Worker (FDW). Under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (EFMA), giving false information, or making false allegations is an offence punishable by imprisonment of up to two years, and/or a fine of up to $20,000. An FDW who is found guilty will also be banned from employment in Singapore. From 2016 to 2018, MOM investigated and took action against 25 FDWs who gave false information and/or made false accusations. Eight FDWs were prosecuted and sentenced to jail for up to eight weeks, or fined up to $9,000. Two were issued composition fines of $2,000. The remaining 15 were issued warnings. All 25 FDWs were repatriated and banned from employment in Singapore."
number of households qualified for foreign domestic worker levy concession under aged person scheme,"Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for Manpower (a) in 2017 and 2018 respectively, how many households with a 65-year-old family member were qualified for the foreign domestic worker levy concession under the aged person scheme; (b) how many of those households had utilised the concession; and (c) following the increase of the qualifying age to 67 years old on 1 April 2019, how does the current proportion of qualified households compare with those in (a).","Mrs Josephine Teo: As of end May 2019, 69,251 households with an foreign domestic worker (FDW) were given the FDW levy concession under the aged person scheme. This is considerably higher than the 65,541 and 61,811 households in 2018 and 2017 respectively. Levy concession was granted automatically to all eligible households1 which had applied for and were allowed to employ an FDW."
factors for improvement in gender pay gap in past decade,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Manpower what are the top three factors that have led to the improvement in the gender pay gap in Singapore over the past decade.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) is currently carrying out further analysis on the factors affecting pay differences between men and women. From our preliminary findings, three main factors have contributed to the narrowing of pay differences. First, the employment rate of women in prime-working ages has risen; they tend to be better educated and earned higher wages than older women. Second, women have moved out of lower-skilled industries more quickly than men. Third, greater access to flexible work arrangements has enabled more women to continue working and maintain their career advancement. More findings will be shared towards the end of 2019."
gender breakdown of under-18 party in successful applications for special marriage licence in last five years,Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Social and Family Development for each of the last five years (a) what is the gender breakdown of the under-18 party in successful applications for the Special Marriage Licence; (b) what is the average age gap between the couples; and (c) how many and what percentage of marriages granted under the Special Marriage Licence have been civil marriages.,"Mr Desmond Lee: A Special Marriage Licence (SML) is required before civil marriages, where at least one party is below 18 years of age, can be solemnised. The process includes a comprehensive assessment of the applicants' suitability for marriage. For Muslim marriages involving a Muslim girl below 18 years of age, an SML is not required, but a Kadi must first assess whether the marriage can endure and is beneficial to both individuals before he solemnises the marriage. In addition, for both civil and Muslim marriages where at least one party is below 21 years old, the couple are required to attend a mandatory marriage preparation programme. Consent from the minor's parents or guardians is also required before the marriage can be solemnised.The gender breakdown and the average age gap for successful SML applications from 2013 to 2017 are as follows:The number of civil and Muslim marriages involving at least one party below 18 years old is as follows:"
serious sexual crimes handled by police in last five years,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Home Affairs with regard to cases of serious sexual crimes handled by the Police in the last five years (a) how many cases were filed each year; (b) how many cases were charged in Court and, for these, what is the median time which elapsed between the making of the Police report and the completion of investigations; (c) how many cases were prosecuted in Court and, of these, what percentage resulted in a conviction; and (d) of those that were not prosecuted in Court, what percentage resulted in (i) a warning being issued to the perpetrator (ii) no further action taken against the perpetrator and (iii) the complainant being warned or charged with false reporting.","Mr K Shanmugam: There were about 250 reported cases of serious sexual crimes (that is, rape and sexual assault by penetration) a year for the period of 2014 to 2018. No further action was taken in about 130 of the cases as no offence was made out after investigations. In about another 10 cases, police charged or warned the complainants for making false reports.Of the remaining 110 cases, about 50 cases were prosecuted in Court per year. About 60 cases resulted in warnings in lieu of prosecution.On average, Police require about 12 months to conclude investigations into such crimes. However, the actual length may differ from case to case depending on their complexity."
ageing in place,Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the percentage of persons over 65 years of age who want to age in place; and (b) what is the percentage of care-givers of persons over the age of 65 years who want to see their care recipients age in place.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Most seniors prefer to age in place for as long as they can, within communities which they are familiar with, and supported by their loved ones. A study by the Duke-NUS Centre for Ageing Research and Education (CARE) conducted from 2011 to 2012 found that 97.9% of persons aged 65 and above prefer to continue staying at home if they cannot live independently, supported by family, foreign domestic workers, or home care services. Only 2.1% of persons aged 65 and above preferred to move to a nursing home if they cannot live independently. We are not aware of corresponding data on the preferences of care-givers."
working adults providing care to and residing with young child and elderly family member,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) in each of the last five years, how many working adults aged 21 to 65 were residing with both a young child aged 12 and below, as well as an elderly family member aged 65 and above; (b) how many in this group of households employ a foreign domestic worker; and (c) whether there are Government studies or findings about the challenges faced by this group in providing care to both the young and the elderly at the same time.","Mr Desmond Lee: The number of working residents aged 21 to 64 living in a household with at least one member aged 65 and above and at least one member aged below 13 years, and whether they employ a foreign domestic worker in the household, is in Table 1 below.In 2018, MOH led a cross-agency review on care-giver support and conducted focus group discussions with more than 200 care-givers and stakeholders, including those caring for both the young and the elderly. Similar to other care-givers, they would appreciate more support in the form of more respite care options, greater workplace flexibility to help them cope with having to care for multiple family members, and more assistance to help them navigate and access various care services. For families that employed foreign domestic workers to alleviate the care-giving burden, some were concerned with whether the foreign domestic workers would be able to cope when care needs of their family members increase.To better support care-givers of seniors, MOH announced the Caregiver Support Action Plan in February 2019, which includes measures related to improving care navigation, financial support and the provision of respite services. Our childcare subsidies also take into account household size, such that larger families with more than two dependants in the household may receive more subsidies. MSF is further reviewing preschool subsidies. MOM will also be expanding the Work-Life Grant from $30 million to $100 million, to encourage more companies to introduce and sustain the use of flexible work arrangements. The Government will continue to seek feedback and review measures to better support the needs of care-givers, including those who are caring for both the young and the elderly."
breakdown on full-time family care-givers and their care recipients,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the current number of full-time family care-givers for persons aged above 65; (b) what is the number of persons aged above 65 who are supported by at least one full-time family care-giver; and (c) what is the breakdown of full-time family care-givers where the care recipients are their parent, aunt/uncle, sibling, or spouse.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Based on extrapolated data from the Retirement and Health Study1 conducted in 2014, we estimate that there are currently about 110,000 to 120,000 family members or friends caring for persons aged 65 and above2. The number of care recipients aged 65 years and above who are cared for by a family member or a friend is estimated to be about 85,000 to 90,000.Of these care recipients, it is estimated that around 60% are cared for by their children, 35% by their spouses, 10% by their grandchildren, 5% by their siblings and 10% by other relatives3. RHS does not record whether the care-givers are providing full-time or part-time care."
complaints of alleged abuse by anchor operator and partner operator childcare centre staff,Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Social and Family Development in the last three years (a) how many complaints has the Ministry received with regard to alleged abuse by staff in Anchor Operator and Partner Operator childcare centres; (b) how many of these complaints have been investigated; and (c) what are the outcomes of these investigations.,"Mr Desmond Lee: The Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) takes a serious view of child mismanagement in preschools. ECDA will investigate every reported case by conducting unannounced centre visits, interviews and verification of records.For serious cases, such as where there appears to be clear intent to harm the child, the case will be referred to the police for criminal investigation. Depending on the nature of the offence, the perpetrator may be prosecuted under the Children and Young Persons Act (CYPA) or other laws.Over the past three years, there was an average of 15 reported cases of alleged child mismanagement in Anchor Operator and Partner Operator centres annually. Of these, over 60% were unsubstantiated. For the other cases, ECDA had issued warning letters to teachers for acts such as spanking or neglecting of children. These were found to be isolated incidents. ECDA had also issued warning letters to selected centres and shortened their licence tenure for not having adequate measures in place to support teachers' classroom management. In this period, no teachers were convicted of an offence under the CYPA or any other law for child mismanagement."
update on deployment of smart gravitraps,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what are the numbers and locations of Smart Gravitraps that are deployed as part of a trial since late 2018; (b) what are the data collected by the traps and whether they are useful in improving dengue control in Singapore; and (c) whether such traps will be introduced nationwide on a permanent basis.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The National Environment Agency (NEA), together with local start-up Orinno Technology Pte Ltd, has developed a ""Smart Gravitrap"" prototype. The Smart Gravitrap is similar to a standard Gravitrap, and is able to attract and trap female Aedes mosquitos looking for sites to lay their eggs. In addition, the Smart Gravitrap captures the mosquito’s flight signature to identify its species and gender, and transmits this information to NEA. This allows NEA officers to conduct data collection and analysis remotely, reducing the reliance on manpower to manually collect data from Gravitraps.NEA is currently preparing for a six-month pilot trial of the Smart Gravitrap prototypes at two construction sites in the second half of 2019. The data collected from this trial will help to further guide the design of the Smart Gravitrap, as it moves into the product development phase. NEA will review the results of the trial before deciding on the operational plans for Smart Gravitraps."
operation and maintenance of tuaspring pte ltd by pub,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether PUB has the required manpower to operate and maintain Tuaspring Pte Ltd; (b) what will be the operating model envisaged for Tuaspring over the long term; and (c) whether there will be cost implications to PUB.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: To safeguard Singapore's water security, the PUB, Singapore’s National Water Agency, issued a 30-day notice to Tuaspring Pte Ltd (TPL) on 17 April 2019 to terminate the Water Purchase Agreement (WPA) between PUB and TPL.After the termination of the WPA, PUB will take over, own, and operate the Tuaspring Desalination Plant (TSDP), similar to the Tuas Desalination Plant which PUB currently operates. PUB has the operational capabilities, experience, and manpower to operate the TSDP. PUB’s immediate focus is to put in place the necessary measures and upgrading works to restore TSDP’s ability to produce desalinated water reliably. PUB is working through the implementation details with TPL to facilitate a smooth handover. PUB will have a better estimate on the costs of operations after taking over the TSDP. PUB will always act to ensure Singapore’s water security and will not allow it to be compromised."
review of endangered species (import and export) act,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether the Ministry will be reviewing and strengthening the Endangered Species (Import and Export) Act following the recent acquittal by the Court of Appeal of a businessman who brought Malagasy rosewood into Singapore; and (b) how does the Ministry ensure that the rosewood will not enter the black market after it is returned to the owner.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: NParks is studying the Court of Appeal’s judgement on the acquittal of Kong Hoo Pte Ltd and its director Mr Wong Wee Keong, and will review its policies under the Endangered Species (Import and Export) Act (ESA) as appropriate. The Court of Appeal had directed that the rosewood be released to the owners as soon as practicable. NParks will do so in accordance with Singapore’s obligation under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna or Flora (CITES). As the rosewood is in transit, local sales of the rosewood will not be allowed and it must be kept under the control of authorised officers under the ESA for the duration of its transit. The international community, particularly countries that are signatories to CITES, will also play a key role in ensuring that the rosewood does not enter their markets illegally."
proportion of ministry of health’s budget allocated for public acute hospitals,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Health (a) in the latest financial year available, what proportion of the Ministry's budget has been allocated to the public acute hospitals; (b) what is the breakdown of such expenditure by the public acute hospitals between capital spending and recurrent operating costs; and (c) what have the trends been over the last five years preceding the latest financial year available.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Over the last five years, MOH's total expenditure has increased from $4.7 billion in FY12 to $10.2 billion in FY17. As a proportion of overall MOH's budget, funding to the public acute hospitals decreased from 77% to 66% over the same period, as we have spent significantly more in preventive health, primary care and intermediate and long-term care. The allocation to capital spending and operating cost is about 15% and 85% respectively."
results of public consultation on ban on elephant ivory sale and display,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for National Development whether he can provide an update on the results of the public consultation on the ban of elephant ivory sale and display in Singapore.,Mr Lawrence Wong: The public consultation on the proposed domestic ivory ban was completed in December 2018. 99% of respondents supported the ban. NParks is evaluating the feedback and will announce the details of the ban soon.
unpaid salaries owed to foreign employees,Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Manpower of the unpaid salaries ordered by the Employment Claims Tribunal in 2017 and 2018 (a) how much was owed to foreign employees; and (b) how much has been recovered by these foreign employees to whom these salary debts were owed.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: The amount of unpaid salaries ordered to foreign claimants by the Employment Claims Tribunals (ECT) since its establishment on 1 April 2017 is shown in the table below. Taking into account that the 2017 figure is not based on the full year, the value of unpaid salaries ordered to foreign claimants by the ECT has not increased in 2018.Overall, the amount of money recovered to foreign claimants is about half of the total ordered amount. In terms of individual outcomes, about 40% of the claimants reported that they received full payment from employers. About 40% reported partial payment, which includes all payments made by employers, insurers or the Migrant Workers Assistance Fund. The average amount owed to foreign claimants who fully recovered salaries from their employers is about $3,500, significantly lower compared to that of claimants who received partial or no payment, about $7,100. The vast majority of cases of partial or no payment involve employers who are in financial difficulty. The evidence is thus very clear, that early reporting of arrears is critical to the prospects of full recovery. This is why MOM consistently educates workers to approach the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management early when they encounter arrears, and urges Non-Governmental Organisations that assist foreign workers to do the same."
increase in mass food poisoning cases,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources in light of the increasing number of mass food poisoning cases (a) whether the Ministry has detected systemic issues in our food hygiene framework; (b) whether the current training and enforcement regime is adequate; and (c) what are the Ministry's plans to prevent future cases.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) takes a serious view of food safety. SFA will take enforcement action against operators who fail to adhere to food hygiene and safety regulations, and for any food hygiene lapses found.SFA conducts regular inspections on a risk-based approach. From January 2018 to March 2019, more than 95,000 inspections of food operators were conducted to ensure compliance with food hygiene and safety. In particular, more than 3,700 checks were conducted on food caterers - a category of food business that poses higher food safety risks. The Government is paying close attention to the mass gastroenteritis incidents reported between November 2018 and March 2019. Joint investigations by the Ministry of Health and SFA thus far found that poor food handling practices, the lack of environmental cleanliness both in the food preparation and common areas, and poor personal hygiene practices were the main causes of these outbreaks. Gastroenteritis can be caused by eating contaminated food, or coming in contact with an infected person or an environment contaminated by viral gastroenteritis. On poor food handling practices, SFA has taken enforcement actions for the lapses found and required operators to rectify the lapses. SFA has stepped up surveillance and engagement of all food operators, particularly for food caterers supplying food to pre-schools, and during festive seasons. Advisories are issued periodically to remind food operators to ensure that their food handlers observe good food hygiene and safety practices, and that their Food Hygiene Officers (FHOs) fulfil their duties to ensure good food hygiene and safety practices, and adherence to time-stamping requirements.  Food handlers and FHOs working at premises that have been suspended due to food hygiene and safety lapses are required to undergo re-training and be re-certified for Basic Food Hygiene Course (BFHC) and WSQ ""Conduct Food & Beverage Hygiene Audit"" programme respectively. SFA will continue to work with the industry to build a strong food safety culture among food business operators through strengthening their food safety management systems as well as competencies of food handlers and FHOs.At the same time, SFA is taking steps to strengthen the regulatory regime for food hygiene and safety. For a start, heavier penalties will be imposed on food operators involved in significant food poisoning incidents. Total composition amounts will be increased and food operators who commit serious food hygiene and safety offences will be prosecuted in Court. In appropriate cases, SFA will also press for deterrent sentences to be imposed by the Court.A multi-pronged approach to incorporate good food hygiene and safety practices as well as good environmental and personal hygiene to prevent and control infection is important to mitigate gastroenteritis. In the recent spate of outbreaks in pre-schools, SFA and the Early Childhood Development Agency issued an advisory to emphasise the need to maintain environmental cleanliness and put in place infection control measures. This includes reinforcing good personal hygiene practices in every individual to prevent the spread of diseases and to protect oneself from acquiring infections. For instance, areas with vomitus must be properly cleaned with bleach to disinfect, and children and pre-school staff who are sick should stay at home so as not to spread infection. Fundamentally, food safety is a joint responsibility across the industry, consumers and the Government as food can be contaminated at any point along the food supply chain. While SFA continues to be vigilant and ensures that regulatory measures are in place and properly enforced, the industry and consumers must also play their part to upkeep high standards of food, environmental and personal hygiene at all times."
more support for environmentally sustainable projects,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources how can the Ministry work with our financial institutions and funding bodies to divert more support for environmentally sustainable projects while reducing exposure to those with adverse impact on the environment.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: MEWR recognises that our financial sector plays a key role in advancing our environmental objectives. We work closely with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to promote green financing in Singapore and to increase the financial sector’s awareness of environmental risks and opportunities. The Government has taken a pragmatic approach through the adoption of international standards, market-led best practices and capability-building in the development of green financing in Singapore. There has been progress on various fronts. (i) In 2015, the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) issued the Guidelines on Responsible Financing. Our local banks have all adopted these guidelines to evaluate their borrowers’ Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) risks and help borrowers improve their sustainability profiles. Most recently, in April 2019, the local banks announced their decision to cease the financing of new coal-fired power plants.(ii) The Singapore Exchange (SGX) introduced the ""Comply or Explain"" Sustainability Reporting Guide for listed companies, beginning from the financial year ending on or after 31 December 2017. The inaugural sustainability reports by first-time reporting companies have progressively been published. (iii) To encourage the issuance of green bonds, MAS introduced a Green Bond Grant Scheme in 2017, which helps to defray the cost of certifying sustainability oriented bonds as green bonds. This Scheme leverages international green bond standards to promote convergence and harmonisation with regional and international markets. Over $4 billion of green bonds have been issued to date. The Government also supports capability-building initiatives as they are key to companies understanding and incorporating ESG risks and opportunities across their core businesses. For example, MAS is working with insurers to anchor ESG research, modelling capabilities and underwriting teams in Singapore to catalyse the development of innovative ESG products.These are encouraging developments. MEWR will continue to work with MAS to support our green financing efforts and steer the broader conversation on sustainable development. This will guide efforts in priority areas such as climate mitigation and adaptation and resource efficiency, as we transition to a resource-efficient and low-carbon future."
"citizens earning less than $1,300 and $2,000 per month from full-time work","Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Manpower in 2018, how many Singapore citizens earned less than $1,300 per month from full-time work and how many earned less than $2,000 per month from full-time work.","Mrs Josephine Teo: Wages have grown at all levels in recent years. In the past 5 years, real wages at the 20th percentile grew 4.2% per annum, more than at the median. As a result, the proportion of full-time employed Singapore Residents earning less than $1,300 in gross monthly income from work1 (including employer CPF contributions) has fallen to about 5%; the number of such residents has also declined by about 40% to 97,000. About 15% earned less than $2,000; the numbers declined by about 30% over five years to 282,000. To support lower-wage workers, the Government will continue to top up their salaries and CPF savings through the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) Scheme. WIS benefits more than 400,000 workers each year, boosting their annual incomes by up to 30%. Total payouts in 2017 amounted to $650 million. Most Workfare recipients also receive other forms of Government support such as GST Vouchers, U-Save rebates and Community Health Assistance Scheme (CHAS)."
public education programmes on vaccines,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Education whether the Ministry will implement public education programmes to inform parents and students about the facts regarding vaccines so that they can make informed choices regarding voluntary vaccines.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: Parents have been supportive of the school-based vaccination programmes, and there is high take-up of vaccines offered in schools. For example, the take-up rate of vaccination against second booster doses of diphtheria as well as the vaccination against polio, both offered in schools at Primary 5, are above 90% each. For the recently rolled out Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccination, the opt-in rate has been slightly over 90% for the first 25 schools covered so far. In addition, measles vaccination coverage among resident children is at 93% for the second dose at 7 years of age.We want to encourage high vaccination take-up rates to achieve herd immunity, so as to protect against the outbreak of potentially serious diseases such as measles, diphtheria and polio. The Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Health Promotion Board (HPB) conduct public education programmes to the general public as well as to parents and students to ensure continued support for the vaccination programmes. For example, through HealthHub, HPB’s online health information portal, members of the public can access information on immunisation as well as details on age-appropriate immunisation for children. For school-based vaccination programmes like the HPV vaccination, the Ministry of Education (MOE) supports HPB in the distribution of an information package prior to the school visit for HPV vaccination, to enable parents to make informed choices. The information package includes a factsheet on HPV vaccination, a brochure on the risk and prevention of HPV, and a letter providing information on the HPV school-based programme. MOE will continue to work with MOH to sustain support for vaccinations offered in schools."

current demand for higher chinese at primary 1,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Education (a) what is the current demand for Higher Chinese at Primary One level; (b) which are the schools that offer Higher Chinese at Primary One level; and (c) whether the Ministry will increase the number of schools which are currently offering Higher Chinese or Higher Mother Tongue.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: All primary schools already offer Higher Chinese to students who have the interest and ability to do so. Demand for Higher Chinese is healthy. Over the past five years, over a quarter of Chinese students offer Higher Chinese at PSLE.Many Primary schools start offering Higher Chinese from Primary Three, and all will offer it from Primary Five. This is in line with our priorities in lower primary education – to ensure students settle well in school, and build a strong foundation in literacy, numeracy and social skills – rather than to specialise them too early.This will also allow schools to make use of the two years of Chinese Language instruction at Primary One and Two to assess if the child has the interest and ability to offer Higher Chinese from Primary Three. Even without offering Higher Chinese, however, the Chinese Language curriculum at Primary One and Two is designed with enrichment modules to stretch students with stronger ability and interest."
"illegal wildlife trade consignments detected at singapore’s land, air and sea checkpoints","Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for National Development (a) in the past three years, how many illegal wildlife trade consignments have been detected at Singapore's land, air and sea checkpoints; (b) how is technology used to better detect and deter illegal wildlife trade through Singapore's checkpoints; and (c) how is Singapore working with international authorities to stamp out organised crime that deal with illegal wildlife trade.","Mr Lawrence Wong: A total of 67 illegal wildlife trade consignments were detected at our border checkpoints from 2016 to 2018. Our enforcement agencies use technology to screen and check travellers and goods at our checkpoints. For example, ICA uses radiographic scanners and hand-held screening devices to ensure that goods that enter Singapore are lawful and legitimate. We also cooperate closely with our regional and international counterparts to combat illegal wildlife trade. For instance, our agencies assess intelligence reports from our partners and work with them to act upon credible and actionable information."
medical insurance coverage for foreign domestic workers,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how many foreign domestic workers are currently covered by additional medical insurance beyond the compulsory coverage of $15,000 for inpatient care and day surgery per annum; and (b) whether the Ministry will require the compulsory medical insurance to also cover outpatient care.","Mrs Josephine Teo: We do not track the number of employers who purchase medical insurance above the required $15,000 coverage for their Foreign Domestic Workers (FDWs). In the past three years, 96% of FDW medical bills were below $15,000. Employers who had not opted for additional insurance coverage and have difficulty paying medical bills for their FDWs can approach the hospitals for assistance. Outpatient bills, which are typically lower, are often managed by FDW employers without the need for insurance. Requiring FDW insurance to cover outpatient care will increase insurance premiums for employers across the board and may not be welcome by all. "
study on gender pay gap,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether the Government has conducted a study on the gender pay gap in Singapore using fixed parameters of occupation and years of service; and (b) if so, what are the results of the study and, if not, whether it intends to conduct such a study.","Mrs Josephine Teo: Differences in pay can be a result of many factors. As women are more likely to exit the workforce, or have intermittent patterns of work due to childcare or elder care-giving responsibilities, these factors could affect their pay rather than gender per se.  MOM is carrying out further analysis on pay differences between men and women to control for other factors such as educational qualifications and years in service. More findings will be shared when ready."
breakdown of taxi drivers and private hire drivers by age group,Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for Transport whether he can provide a breakdown of the current number of taxi drivers and private hire drivers by their respective age groups.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: As of February 2019, there are about 41,000 and 99,900 Private Hire Car Driver’s Vocational Licence (PDVL) holders and Taxi Driver’s Vocational Licence (TDVL) holders respectively. The age breakdown is shown in the table below."
steps to ensure thales signalling system is safe for use on mrt system,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for Transport what are the steps that LTA has taken to ensure that the Thales signalling system used on Singapore's MRT system is safe for operation in light of the train collisions at Joo Koon station in 2017 and on the Tseun Wan line in Hong Kong recently.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Ensuring the safety of rail operations is our top priority. The recent train collision on the Tsuen Wan line in Hong Kong is a reminder that we must always be vigilant every step of the way, from robust system design, to rigorous testing and commissioning, and responsible operations and maintenance. The Thales SelTrac Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC) signalling system is an established product and has been adapted for use on 86 metros across 40 different countries. Hong Kong’s Tsuen Wan line and Singapore’s North-South and East-West Lines (NSEWL) also use the system. Each system is however custom-built to the metro’s unique architecture and specifications, with software logic tailored for the local needs and conditions. The Hong Kong authorities are investigating the 18 March 2019 train collision. This may take a few months. We will study the investigation report when it is available. There were media articles linking the incident to a dual backup system which was uniquely designed for the Tsuen Wan line’s signalling system. None of our MRT or LRT lines use such a system. Regardless, we should avoid unnecessary speculation into the root causes of the incident until the formal investigation report is available. The Joo Koon incident in late 2017 was due to complications from concurrently operating the NSEWL’s legacy and new CBTC signalling systems on the same line. We understand that this was not the case for the collision on the Tsuen Wan line in Hong Kong. The NSEWL now operates entirely on the CBTC signalling system, so a similar incident to Joo Koon will not recur.Arising from the Joo Koon incident, LTA invited Thales to set up a CBTC simulation laboratory in Singapore – the first of its kind in Asia, and the largest by Thales in the world. This has allowed LTA and SMRT to perform additional tests to fine-tune the CBTC signalling system’s software and hardware before it is implemented on our rail lines. It has also contributed to the NSEWL’s vast improvement in rail reliability."
review of speed limit on non-expressway roads,"Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether LTA has considered reducing the speed limit for non-expressway roads to improve road safety in light of LTA's push for the use of bicycles, e-bicycles and personal mobility devices on our streets and roads; and (b) if not, what are the considerations that LTA takes into account for not doing so.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Road speed limits are set to ensure that motorists can travel safely and efficiently. When setting the speed limit of roads, LTA generally considers factors such as road geometry and the level of pedestrian activities. Locations with higher pedestrian activities (e.g. School Zones and Silver Zones) have reduced speed limits of 40 km/hour. Rather than road speed limits, we seek to develop off-road infrastructure to create a conducive environment for all active mobility users. To enhance active mobility infrastructure, LTA will roll out more dedicated cycling paths and build a cycling network in every HDB town by 2030. This means a total of 700 km of cycling paths across the island. Apart from infrastructure, user behaviour is critical for ensuring safety. We urge all users to play their part by exercising caution and consideration when using our roads and paths."
hdb bto applicants who obtained housing grants,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development for each type of flat in the past five years (a) what are the percentages and numbers of HDB BTO applicants who have obtained HDB housing grants; (b) what are the numbers and percentages for each type of grant; and (c) what is the lowest price for that type of flat for the successful grant applicant.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: First-timer households buying a flat from the HDB enjoy a subsidised flat price, and may receive up to $80,000 in housing grants, comprising the Additional CPF Housing Grant (AHG) and Special CPF Housing Grant (SHG). Among the first-timer households that had booked a flat between January 2014 and December 2018, about 48,600 or 61% have obtained the AHG and/or SHG (as detailed in Table 1).The lowest flat prices (after grants) paid by the successful grant applicants are set out in Table 2."
"percentage of spending on mental health, diabetes and ageing versus total healthcare spending in 2018 against amount budgeted for 2019","Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Health for 2018 (actual) and 2019 (budgeted), what is the percentage of spend on (i) mental health versus total healthcare spend (ii) diabetes versus total healthcare spend and (iii) ageing versus total healthcare spend.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Based on the latest available expenditure data, MOH’s operating expenditure for financial year 2017 was $8.7 billion, of which about 3%, 11% and 6% were spent on mental health, diabetes mellitus and aged care respectively.MOH’s expenditure on mental health comprises operating subvention to Institute of Mental Health, psychiatry units in other Public Healthcare Institutions and intermediate & long-term care facilities to provide subsidised patient care, as well as funding for various programmes under the National Mental Health Blueprint and Community Mental Health Masterplan. The figures do not include Government’s funding for other mental health initiatives such as school allied educators to provide students with counselling and related support.MOH’s expenditure on diabetes mellitus comprises operating subvention to public healthcare institutions and participating CHAS clinics to provide subsidised care to patients with diabetes as well as health promotion activities under the War on Diabetes. MOH’s expenditure on ageing comprises operating subvention to long-term care and social aged care facilities to provide patient subsidies for residential, day care and home care services. It does not include government funding on other ageing initiatives or subsidies provided to the Pioneer Generation and Merdeka Generation which are separately catered for under the Pioneer Generation Fund and Merdeka Generation Fund respectively."
competition from china’s plan for greater bay area project,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what is the Ministry's assessment of the risk posed to the competitiveness of key industries in Singapore such as financial services and ICT by China's plan for a Greater Bay Area; and (b) what plans are being developed to draw economic benefits and mitigate competitive risk from the Greater Bay Area project.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: Singapore welcomes the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA)1, which is part of China’s strategy to promote the integrated development of its various regions2. The GBA aims to become a vibrant world-class city cluster and global innovation hub that will lead China’s further reforms and opening up. This will create new opportunities that are beneficial to regional economies. Given our strong ties with GBA cities and businesses, Singapore is well-placed to tap on potential business opportunities in the GBA.Singapore agencies and counterparts at the Guangdong Provincial People’s Government know one another well. Singapore holds regular ministerial meetings with Guangdong through the Singapore-Guangdong Collaboration Council (SGCC). In November 2018, the China-Singapore Guangzhou Knowledge City (CSGKC) was also elevated as a State-Level Bilateral Cooperation project to promote cooperation in areas such as technology innovation, intellectual property rights, and advanced manufacturing. The GBA outline development plan highlights the CSGKC as a key technology innovation platform. As part of our engagement with the GBA, Singapore will also twin with Shenzhen under the ASEAN Smart Cities Network. Hong Kong is another GBA city which Singapore is well-connected to. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) meet regularly to discuss financial regulatory issues. MAS and HKMA have signed agreements to cooperate including a FinTech Cooperation Agreement and a Memorandum of Understanding to facilitate digital trade and trade financing between our two markets.  There is strong mutual desire between Singapore and GBA authorities to nurture and grow a vibrant digital economy. The various platforms that have been established allow for active exchange of ideas and collaboration between government, companies, universities and research institutes. This will lead to opportunities for Singapore’s ICT, financial and other companies in the GBA in the areas of technology innovation, infrastructure development, data management, and digitalisation. We will also continue to build on our competitiveness as a financial hub. Singapore has deep strengths across a range of financial activities, including asset management, foreign exchange and derivatives, insurance and reinsurance. We are a major US dollar funding market and our capital markets serve not just Southeast Asia, but the pan-Asian region. Singapore is also a leading centre for FinTech.  At the same time, the Singapore Government continues to invest heavily to help our businesses and people remain competitive and translate opportunities into tangible gains. We do so by continually strengthening our value propositions by acquiring deep skills, improving our productivity, and encouraging innovation. For example, the Digital Economy Framework for Action introduced last year covers programmes such as the SMEs Go Digital Programme, which supports SMEs in their digitalisation efforts to improve their productivity. The TechSkills Accelerator (TeSA) programme, on the other hand, equips ICT professionals to take on deeper tech roles, and for non-ICT workers to switch to a tech career. These moves will ensure that Singapore has a good chance of sustaining our competitiveness and remaining relevant in the global economy. The Government is also committed to work in tandem with leading global and local ICT and tech companies, to encourage industry investments that complement government efforts in building a thriving ecosystem of digital opportunities for all."
remedial actions following high blood pressure drug recall,"Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Health regarding the three brands of a high blood pressure drug which are being recalled, what is being done to ensure that all medication is tested and cleared before being released into the market.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: On 28 March 2019, the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) recalled three brands of medicines which belong to the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) class of blood pressure medication and contain the ingredient losartan. All three medicines were manufactured by Hetero Labs Limited. Following the recall of several losartan medicines in US due to the presence of a nitrosamine impurity, N-nitroso-N-methyl-4-aminobutyric acid (NMBA), HSA tested the suspected losartan medicines and they were found to contain trace amounts of NMBA which are above the acceptable limit1.  Under HSA's drug regulatory regime, stringent standards are set on the quality and safety of medicines sold in Singapore. Before being approved for sale, the medicines are evaluated to ensure that they meet the required international standards of quality, safety and efficacy. After approval, HSA conducts post-market surveillance, which includes monitoring of global developments and risk-based product sampling and testing for compliance to quality and safety specifications. Products found to be deficient in quality will be withdrawn from the market. Manufacturers are also required to test all batches of medicines, including the levels of specific impurities, to ensure that they comply with stipulated standards.  The routine tests required of the manufacturers are based on known impurities that may be generated during the manufacturing process, as it is not practical to exhaustively test for all types of impurities. In the case of the recalled losartan medicines, testing for nitrosamines like NMBA was not previously part of the testing parameters of ARB medicines as NMBA was not expected to be generated in the manufacturing process. This approach is similar to that adopted in other countries including the US, Canada and the European Union.  HSA now requires companies supplying ARBs to ensure that future batches of their medicines are tested and do not have unacceptable levels of nitrosamine impurities before supply to Singapore. HSA has also been working with suppliers and international regulatory agencies to verify the cause of contamination and to formulate measures to eliminate the nitrosamines in the medium to longer term. HSA will continue to monitor the quality and safety of these medicines to safeguard public health."
recall of fisher-price baby rocker in us,Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Trade and Industry in light of the recent recall of the Fisher-Price baby rocker in the US (a) whether these rockers have been imported into Singapore; (b) whether there is a process of tracking and assessing the safety of infant or baby products that are imported into Singapore; and (c) what are the measures in place to ensure imported products meant for infant or children are safe for use.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: Enterprise Singapore (ESG) oversees the safety of general consumer products sold in Singapore. General consumer products, including products for use by children, that are not regulated under any other legislations, are required to meet applicable international safety standards under the Consumer Protection (Consumer Goods Safety Requirements) Regulations administered by ESG. While these general consumer goods are not required to be pre-approved before they are sold in the market, ESG monitors safety issues in such goods via consumer feedback and overseas consumer product notices and will work with suppliers to address any safety concerns quickly. Based on the information it gathers, ESG conducts tests on selected consumer products in the market to ensure that they are safe. Suppliers found with non compliant products will be asked to rectify or stop sale. This risk-based approach towards product safety regulation allows general consumer products, which have lower safety risks, to enter the market quickly without the need for comprehensive but resource intensive testing. This approach balances safeguarding consumers safety and ensuring market efficiency. ESG is aware that Fisher-Price has issued a voluntary recall globally, including in Singapore, of its Rock ‘N Play Sleepers and has issued an alert warning consumers to discontinue the use of the product. ESG has also published the alert on its website in April 2019. Consumers are strongly encouraged to respond to the product recall by Fisher-Price. Parents should exercise vigilance when buying and using products for their children, including observing the safety labels on products. Where a child’s entire weight is to be placed on a product, parents should check the product’s recommended maximum weight capacity to ensure it is suitable for their children. Baby rockers should only be used on the floor and not on elevated or soft surfaces as they may tipover and cause injury or suffocation. Parents should also supervise their children and secure them with restraints when they are in baby rockers."
trees uprooted and fallen in public spaces last year,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for National Development (a) how many trees have been uprooted and fallen in public spaces last year; (b) what are the reasons for these incidents; and (c) whether the Ministry has plans to further reduce the number of such incidents.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: In 2018, 217 trees were uprooted and fell in public spaces. These incidents were due to strong winds and heavy rainfall. For the two million trees in urban areas under its care, NParks has a rigorous tree inspection regime in place which consists of regular inspections every 12 to 24 months, and additional annual in-depth inspections for larger trees. NParks also carries out measures such as replacing storm-vulnerable species with hardier trees, pruning trees regularly and prior to periods of more severe weather conditions, and using technology to analyse risk and improve inspection processes. NParks will continue to ensure that its tree management programme remains robust and comprehensive.There are another one million trees in public housing estates that are managed by the Town Councils (TCs). NParks is working with the TCs and HDB to set up a nation-wide tree registry system to better manage these trees. This system will comprehensively map out trees in public housing estates, and allow TCs to develop suitable tree care regimes and tree replacement programmes. NParks also provides technical training on tree health and maintenance for stakeholders who manage trees in Singapore, including TCs."
poor customer and helpdesk service by singapore telcos,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) whether the Ministry is aware of the complaints of poor customer service by the Singapore telcos; and (b) what can the Ministry do to get the telcos to improve their phone helpdesk especially for the many elderly customers who have to be put on hold for long periods to speak to an officer.,"Mr S Iswaran: The number of complaints received by the Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA) and the telecommunication companies (telcos) concerning poor customer service by telecos has shown a decreasing trend over the past five years. IMDA requires telcos to look into every complaint and see how they can serve their customers better. IMDA also tracks consumer satisfaction of telecommunication services through the Consumer Awareness and Satisfaction Survey (CASS). The 2018 CASS showed that consumers were generally satisfied with their telcos, and consumer satisfaction has improved in several areas, including hotline waiting times, the time taken to resolve complaints, and the competence of customer service officers. An April 2019 poll of non-English speaking individuals conducted by IMDA also found that respondents were generally satisfied with the customer service by telcos. To address the needs of elderly customers, several telcos now allow customers to make appointments for telcos to call them back, so they do not have to wait on the line for too long. In addition, when receiving calls on their hotlines, the telcos will arrange for elderly customers to be served by officers who can speak the same language or dialect."
"government support for diagnosis, treatment and subsidy for persons with rare diseases in singapore","Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Health how is the Government supporting the diagnosis, treatment and subsidising of persons with rare diseases in Singapore.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Most of the rare diseases are diagnosed in childhood. While most of these diseases do not yet have an effective cure, early diagnosis and treatment for some of the diseases can substantially extend a patient’s lifespan and improve his quality of life.  To enable early diagnosis, our public healthcare institutions have implemented the National Expanded Newborn Screening Programme which covers more than 30 rare diseases. At our public healthcare institutions, patients with rare diseases can have access to subsidised inpatient and outpatient services. MediShield Life and MediSave can be utilised to pay for their hospital bills. Patients who need help with their bills may also apply for financial assistance such as MediFund and Medication Assistance Fund.A small number of individuals with very rare conditions require medications that are very costly. Our hospitals do their best to assist these patients, for example by negotiating price discounts with manufacturers for the medications where possible, waiving parts of their medical fees or drawing from hospital charity funds.  MOH recognises that more support is needed for these patients, and is looking into providing greater support for them. More details will be made known later this year."
traffic recovery procedures and response time,"Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for Transport (a) what are the current procedures in traffic recovery following traffic and road failures caused by accidents, road cracks and fallen trees; (b) how much time do current responses take to recover traffic to normal conditions; (c) whether there are plans to improve current responses to such sudden traffic failures; and (d) whether there are sufficient channels to notify motorists to avoid the affected area to prevent further congestion.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Traffic disruptions can be caused by accidents, road defects, or fallen trees. For accidents, the Traffic Police will respond as quickly as possible to the accident scene. The Singapore Civil Defence Force may also be activated if there are injuries. For road defects that affect traffic safety, LTA will carry out rectification works on an urgent basis. For fallen trees, NParks will deploy its Rapid Response Team as soon as possible. Traffic recovery procedures and response times differ depending on the nature of the incidents. Where there is significant traffic impact, officers will be deployed on the ground to manage the situation. LTA also notifies the public on the incident location and traffic situation via radio and online channels so that they avoid the affected areas."
number of kitchen exhaust duct fires from 2014 to 2018 and measures to minimise risk of such incidents,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) how many cases of kitchen exhaust duct fires there have there been each year from 2014 to 2018; and (b) what measures are being taken to minimise the risk of such incidents.,"Mr K Shanmugam: From 2014 to 2018, there were a total of 42 fires involving kitchen exhaust ducts (KEDs). The fires mainly occurred at food establishments within residential areas such as coffee shops and hawker centres. The main cause was poor maintenance of the ducts, causing grease to accumulate and which ignited during cooking. The Fire Code, which is administered by SCDF under the Fire Safety Act, as well as the Singapore Food Agency’s (SFA) Environmental Public Health (Food Hygiene) Regulations, requires KEDs to be maintained regularly. SFA and SCDF take a stern view against non-compliance. Over the last five years, a total of 270 enforcement actions were taken against premises owners or occupiers who did not comply with regulations related to KEDs.To educate the public, SFA and SCDF have produced advisories, posters and brochures on the fire safety aspects of KEDs, and distributed them to stallholders."
number of seniors benefiting from home-based care services from 2016 to 2018,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Health for each year from 2016 to 2018 (a) how many seniors have benefited from home-based care services; (b) how many referrals for home-based care have been received by the Agency for Integrated Care; (c) what is the total number of public and private home-based care providers; and (d) how many persons are employed in the home-based care sector, excluding foreign domestic workers.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Over the years, MOH has grown the supply of home-based care services to enable more seniors to age in place. Today, we estimate that there are more than 70 home-based care providers providing a range of home-based care services, such as home medical, home nursing and home personal care services. Based on data reported by Government funded home-based care providers, the number of workers (excluding foreign domestic workers) providing home care services was 890 in 2016, 1,050 in 2017 and 1,120 in 2018. The number of seniors who have benefited from subsidised home care services was 5,200 in 2016, 6,000 in 2017 and 6,700 in 2018. The number of referrals to home care services received by the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) was 15,800 in 2016, 16,300 in 2017 and 14,400 in 2018. The number of referrals is non-unique as some seniors may be referred to more than one service at different points in time. Not all referrals result in the take-up of services as clients may opt for alternative care options."
update and review on liquor control act,Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for Home Affairs since the introduction of regulatory measures to restrict alcohol consumption in public places (a) what has been the number and trend of breaches since then; (b) what has been the number of public complaints relating to alcohol consumption in public places; and (c) whether there is a need to further restrict alcohol sale and consumption in HDB neighbourhood estates.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Act, introduced in 2015, prohibits alcohol consumption in all public places between 10.30 pm and 7.00 am. Stricter hours are imposed in designated liquor control zones i.e. Little India and Geylang.As of 31 March 2019, around 4,500 breaches have been detected since the coming into force of the Act in 2015. The trend has been improving, from around 1,200 per year in 2015 and 2016, to under 800 in 2018. Police do not track the number of complaints relating to alcohol consumption in public places. However, the decrease in the number of breaches over the years suggests the number of such complaints has similarly reduced. Our assessment is that liquor-related law and order issues are under control. There is no need to further restrict alcohol sale and consumption at this juncture, including at HDB neighbourhood estates. MHA and Police will regularly review these policies, taking into consideration public feedback as well."
role of government in export sales of weapons and ammunition by singapore technologies land systems,"Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for Defence (a) what strategic role does the Government play in approving, restricting or advising Singapore Technologies Land Systems (formerly ST Kinetics) regarding export sales of weapons and ammunition to potential buyers; and (b) whether and how such decisions take into account risk factors such as the likelihood of such arms being used to commit war crimes or in violation of international law.","Dr Ng Eng Hen: Under the Strategic Goods (Control) Act and Regulations, export of all weapons and ammunition from Singapore require an exit permit from the Singapore Customs. Exit permits will only be issued if such exports satisfy international obligations and commitments under the relevant UN Security Council Resolutions and other agreements which Singapore has ratified. This includes preventing illicit trade in conventional arms, Weapons of Mass Destruction and related materials as well as prohibition of exports to named countries."
"breakdown of singaporeans utilising nursing homes, home care, day care and respite care services","Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Health by household income or housing type and by age group, what is the current number of Singaporeans utilising nursing homes, home care, day care (including dementia day care) and respite care services respectively.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Based on records submitted by care providers to MOH, in the fourth quarter of 2018, there were around 16,000 unique Singapore residents benefiting from subsidised home and community care services, and around 12,000 on subsidised nursing home services. These figures include those using subsidised respite care services in each setting. Among the subsidised home and community care residents, around half were aged 80 and above, around three in ten were aged 70 to 79, and the remainder aged 69 and below. Around three in five received the maximum subsidy.  Among the subsidised nursing home residents, around four in ten were aged 80 and above, around three in ten were aged 70 to 79, and the remainder aged 69 and below. More than four in five of these residents received the maximum subsidy."
paternity leave taken in each of past five years,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Social and Family Development for each year in the past five years (a) what is the median number of days of paternity leave taken by fathers; and (b) what is the median number of days of shared parental leave taken by fathers.,"Mr Desmond Lee: The median number of days of Government Paid Paternity Leave (GPPL) and Shared Parental Leave (SPL) taken by fathers who took at least one day of GPPL or SPL in the last five years is shown in Table 1 below.In 2013, we introduced one week of GPPL and one week of SPL. To better support families, in 2015 the Government encouraged companies to offer eligible fathers a second week of GPPL. In 2017, it was made mandatory for companies to offer the second week of GPPL. SPL was also increased from one to four weeks."
regulation of student care centres,"Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) whether all student care centres in Singapore are regulated by the Ministry; and (b) whether there are requirements for background checks or screening of candidates to be teachers, staff or volunteers at student care centres and, if not, whether the Ministry has any plans to do so in the future.","Mr Desmond Lee: Student Care Centres (SCCs)1 that administer the Student Care Fee Assistance (SCFA) scheme are registered with the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF). These SCCs are prohibited from employing individuals who have been convicted, warned, or are being investigated, for offences involving dishonesty or moral turpitude. SCC staff are required to declare whether they have criminal records, have been charged in a court or are being investigated by the police, in Singapore and/or other countries.Registered SCCs are also required to meet stipulated standards in areas of supervision, physical environment, operating hours, safety, health and hygiene, and provide a structured daily programme. MSF conducts audits on registered SCCs to ensure compliance with the above requirements."
applications for comcare child care subsidy,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) in each of the last three years, how many applications has the Ministry received for the ComCare Child Care subsidy; (b) how many of these applications have been approved; (c) what is the demographic profile of the successful and rejected applicants respectively; and (d) what are the common reasons for rejection.","Mr Desmond Lee: Low-income families can apply for ComCare child care subsidies if they are unable to afford child care fees after receiving the Basic and Additional Subsidies provided by the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA). From 2016 to 2018, there were applications for an average of 4,440 children yearly for ComCare child care subsidies, of which 86% were approved on average.MSF does not track the demographic profile of these applicants or the reasons for all rejected applications. Some applicants did not qualify for the assistance because their household income exceeded the income criteria, or because they had not yet applied for Basic and Additional subsidies before applying for ComCare child care subsidies."
average cash top-up by patients after medishield life and medisave deductions for subsidised hospitalisations,"Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for Health for each year from 2015 to 2018 (a) how many Singaporeans and PRs paid more than $100 in cash after taking into account subsidies, MediShield Life and MediSave deductions arising from all subsidised hospitalisations; and (b) out of all these aforesaid subsidised hospitalisations, what was the average amount paid by each patient in cash.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Between 2015 to 2017, the latest year with available data, about eight in 10 subsidised hospitalisation bills were paid with $100 or less in cash. As bill sizes vary depending significantly on the complexity of the treatment and length of stay, a median rather than an average is a more meaningful reflection of the cash payments for the remaining bills. As shown at Table 1, the median cash payment for these bills is about $500. There has been a reduction in the figure from 2015 to 2017 with the introduction of MediShield Life. We will continue to review our healthcare financing framework regularly. No Singaporean will be denied appropriate healthcare because of affordability reasons. Singaporeans who have difficulty coping with their medical bills can apply through medical social workers in public healthcare institutions for additional MediFund support."
statistics and review on application of number of busking sites and audition cycles for buskers,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) why is there an allocation of only five busking sites to each successful applicant of a Busking Card; and (b) whether the Ministry plans to review and expand the number of (i) designated busking sites (ii) audition cycles per year and (iii) audition slots available under each audition cycle.","17 Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth for each year in the past five years (a) how many applications for a Busking Card has the Ministry received; (b) how many applications have been rejected; (c) what are the top three reasons for rejecting an application; and (d) in how many audition cycles are the audition slots fully taken up.18 Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) what are the factors considered when deciding which five busking locations are to be allocated to a busker apart from the buskers' provided list of eight interested locations; and (b) for each designated busking location, what are the numbers of applicants and successful applicants in the past year.Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: The Busking Scheme was introduced in 1997 to support the Government's efforts to enhance Singapore's vibrancy, and provide opportunities for Singaporeans to enjoy the arts in everyday spaces from our city centre to our neighbourhoods.Over the past five years, NAC has received an average of around 300 busking applications each year for a Letter of Endorsement. To accommodate greater interest in the Busking Scheme, the capacity of the quarterly auditions has been gradually increased. About 80% of the 600 slots available were utilised last year, and around one in two applicants were successful in obtaining a Letter of Endorsement.In their audition, buskers are assessed by a panel of three arts professionals on their: (i) competency and skill in performance; (ii) engagement with the audience; (iii) expressiveness and confidence; and (iv) innovation and originality.If they are successful, they will be allocated a number of busking sites so that there is a good spread of buskers across different locations in Singapore, and prevents overcrowding in certain spots which may cause dis-amenities such as loud noise and threat to safety. Over 90% of buskers are allocated at least one of their preferred locations. Currently, there are a total of around 300 buskers who have been given approval to busk at over 80 locations."
attracting local workers in senior care industry,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Health for the senior care industry (a) what is the percentage of local workers; and (b) what are the plans to attract more locals.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Based on data reported by MOH-subvented service providers in 2018, there were 12,000 workers working in the Long Term Care (LTC) sector1, of which about 40% are locals.We have been enhancing the attractiveness of LTC jobs to locals by (a) raising awareness and interest in job opportunities within the sector, (b) providing training and development opportunities, and (c) increasing salary competitiveness. For example, the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) works with LTC providers and recruitment partners like Workforce Singapore (WSG) and Employment and Employability Institute (e2i) to facilitate local employment and raise awareness of job opportunities in the LTC sector. In 2018, more than 1,000 locals have joined the LTC sector through various recruitment efforts. MOH and AIC also support LTC providers in staff training and development. For example, training for newly hired local support care staff2 can be funded under the Community Care Traineeship Programme (CCTP) so they can be equipped with requisite skills to perform in their new roles. Providers are also eligible for on-the-job training support of up to $10,000 per local support staff recruited to facilitate mentoring, supervision and development of new hires. Local staff may apply for sponsorship through the Community Care Manpower Development Award (CCMDA) to pursue advance training in skills relevant to their work. Lastly, to increase local salary competitiveness, MOH works with employers to review salaries of workers regularly to ensure that they are adequately recognised for their efforts. Between 2012 and 2017, MOH had provided funding support to raise wages of workers across participating providers which saw a 30% increase in aggregate over this period.Going forward, we will continue to step up our efforts to attract locals to this sector."
regulation on access to cctvs installed in public and private premises,Mr Ang Wei Neng asked the Minister for Communications and Information whether the Ministry has plans to better regulate the installation and access to CCTVs installed in public and private premises in the wake of the recent outcry of CCTVs in a private gym.,"Mr S Iswaran: The Police Licensing and Regulatory Department requires any person who provides CCTV installation or maintenance as a service to have a Security Service Provider licence under the Private Security Industry Act. These licensees must undergo security screening to ensure they are fit and proper persons to provide security services. In addition, under the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA), organisations are required to notify individuals of the purpose and obtain their consent to collect, use or disclose their personal data, including those captured by CCTV recordings. Also, organisations are required to protect personal data in their possession or control by making reasonable security arrangements. The Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) has issued advisory guidelines to help organisations deploying CCTVs comply with the PDPA. The advisory guidelines provide examples of good practices, such as placing notices at points of entry to a building or prominent locations in a venue, where individuals are able to read the notices prior to the collection of their personal data by CCTVs.   Organisations that install CCTVs but fail to notify or obtain consent from an individual for the collection of his/her personal data, or fail to protect such personal data, are liable for breaching the PDPA. The PDPC will investigate and take enforcement action for breaches, which include issuing directions and imposing financial penalties."
measures to prevent healthcare insurance fraud,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Health how is the Ministry working with doctors and healthcare staff to prevent healthcare insurance fraud.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: MOH takes a serious view of any attempts to defraud the healthcare system at the expense of Singaporeans. Fraudulent behaviour, such as inappropriate patient referrals for financial gains and making false claims for services, is wrong and unethical. It also raises the overall costs of healthcare in Singapore, leading to Singaporeans paying more for their healthcare services and insurance plans. Various stakeholders have a part to play in combating healthcare insurance fraud. MOH monitors the landscape of MediShield Life and Integrated Shield Plan (IP) claims, and works with IP insurers to identify anomalous trends. For cases where criminal offences are suspected, MOH and insurers will refer them to the police for further investigation. The Singapore Medical Council (SMC) provides guidance to doctors through the Ethical Code and Ethical Guidelines (ECEG) on ethical practice and professional standards to ensure the wellbeing of patients. In particular, the ECEG prohibits doctors from letting business or financial considerations influence the objectivity of their clinical judgement in their management of patients. Doctors who contravene the ECEG can be subject to disciplinary action by SMC. Doctors, healthcare staff, patients, insurance providers, financial advisors and members of the public should lodge a complaint to MOH, SMC or the police if they suspect any fraudulent behaviour, or receive any suspicious propositions in relation to their healthcare services or health insurance claims. "
time limit for telecommunications companies to complete porting of telephone numbers,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Communications and Information with regard to the porting of telephone numbers (a) what is the time limit for telecommunications companies to complete the process; and (b) how should the costs of delays be distributed.,"Mr S Iswaran: The timeframe for telephone number porting depends on the telephony service and type of customer involved. Operators are required to complete the porting of mobile telephone numbers within one working day. Operators are also required to complete fixed-line number porting for consumers within five working days. A longer timeframe may apply in some instances. For example, where consumers are porting their fixed-line telephone number while also switching their fibre broadband provider, it would take at least an additional three working days for the incoming provider to activate fibre services before the number porting process can begin. If the number porting process takes longer than expected, the subscriber still receives services from the outgoing operator before the number is ported, and hence is charged fees under his or her contract. Subscribers who are aggrieved can nevertheless approach the relevant operator for recourse, including for an adjustment or waiver of the bill. The Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA) will also step in to safeguard the consumer interest where necessary."
priority for senior citizens applying for two-room flexi flats with peers as group application,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development whether priority can be given to senior citizens who wish to apply for 2-room Flexi flats together with their peers as a group application as they wish to be neighbours with each other.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB sets aside a high proportion of the public flat supply of 2-room Flexi flats for elderly applicants aged 55 and above. The Build-To-Order application rates for elderly applicants have been stable at below two times the flat supply set aside for them, with almost all elderly applicants invited to book a flat.  Elderly applicants can also make use of the Senior Priority Scheme (SPS) to improve their chances when they apply for a two-room Flexi flat near their current home or their married child. So eligible seniors can apply under the SPS to be neighbours with one another in a new project."
number of complaints received by personal data protection commission and referred for alternative dispute resolution,"Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) since the Personal Data Protection Commission started receiving complaints in 2014, how many complaints has it referred for alternative dispute resolution under section 27(1) and (2) of the Personal Data Protection Act; and (b) of the complaints sent for such alternative dispute resolution, how many resulted in complainants receiving settlement payments or other redress.","Mr S Iswaran: Since 2014, PDPC successfully facilitated a resolution between the complainant and the relevant organisation in 866 instances. In addition, one case was sent to mediation with the mutual consent of both parties. The settlement terms are confidential."
medical tourism receipts for 2015 to 2018,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Trade and Industry what has been the amount of medical tourism receipts for each year from 2015 to 2018.,Mr Chan Chun Sing: My Ministry and agencies do not have comprehensive data on the amount of medical expenditure incurred by overseas visitors in Singapore. Medical tourism is not part of our tourism strategy.  
cpf members with and without basic retirement sum in their retirement accounts on reaching 55 in last three years,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Manpower what is the number and proportion of CPF members turning 55 years of age in 2016, 2017 and 2018 respectively who have set aside the Basic Retirement Sum, disaggregated by gender and household income or by housing type as a proxy for household income.","32 Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the number and percentage of current CPF members who are inactive, broken down by gender; (b) of the inactive members, in the last three years, what percentage does not have at least the CPF Basic Retirement Sum in their Retirement Accounts when they turned 55 years old, broken down by gender; and (c) what is the difference in CPF balances of inactive male and female members.Mrs Josephine Teo: The cohort Basic Retirement Sum (BRS) is adjusted every year to take into consideration inflation and rising standards of living for successive cohorts of seniors in retirement. Even so, the proportion of active CPF members turning age 55 who had set aside their cohort BRS has increased steadily as shown in Table 1. This reflects higher labour force participation rates and rising incomes of successive cohorts of members.The BRS attainment for both male and female CPF members have improved over the years and the difference in their savings have also narrowed. A study published by the CPF Board1 showed that the male-to-female average CPF balance ratio has reduced from 1.20 in 2006 to 1.13 in 2016. We expect this trend to continue.BRS attainment tends to mirror property wealth. It is highest among active CPF members who own a private property, and lowest for active CPF members who own 3-room or smaller HDB flats.It is difficult to draw meaningful conclusions by looking at CPF balances of members who are economically inactive and thus not required to make CPF contributions. They are likely to have other means of provision which CPF Board has no sight of. Nevertheless, inactive CPF members who wish to save through the CPF system can do so through voluntary top-ups to their CPF accounts either through cash or CPF transfers from other members. These members can also benefit from several recent enhancements that make it easier for members to receive CPF transfers from their spouse, children and grandchildren."
statistics on households with at least one member over age 65 employing foreign domestic workers from 2015 to 2018,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Manpower for each year from 2015 to 2018 and by disaggregated housing type (a) what is the number and proportion of households with at least one member over the age of 65 employing foreign domestic workers; and (b) how many of such households have received the Foreign Domestic Worker Grant.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: From 2015 to 2018, the number and proportion of resident households with at least one member aged 65 and above, employing foreign domestic workers (FDW) are shown in Table 1. Households with members aged 65 and above who are Singapore Citizens (SCs) pay the concessionary levy rate of $60 per month1 for the FDW they hire. In addition to this, the FDW Grant2 provides support for eligible families to hire an FDW to care for loved ones who require permanent assistance with at least three activities of daily living. As at December 2018, about 9,500 households caring for seniors, aged 65 and above, were receiving the FDW Grant."
environmental impact on singapore of methane fumes incident at pasir gudang,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources with regard to the methane fumes incident at Pasir Gudang (a) what is the environmental impact on Singapore; (b) whether there is an adverse impact on our fisheries; and (c) what are the early detection systems put in place to alert Singaporeans.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: According to media reports, since 7 March 2019, more than 3,000 Johoreans fell ill as a result of illegal dumping of chemical waste into Sungai Kim Kim, a river in Pasir Gudang. Hazardous fumes caused severe symptoms including nausea, shortness of breath and vomiting. Thousands needed immediate medical attention and many, including children, were admitted to hospitals for treatment. All 111 schools in the Pasir Gudang district were closed on 13 March 2019 for more than two weeks. Throughout this period, our agencies have been closely monitoring the situation and putting in place precautionary measures to guard against any potential pollution impacts arising from the illegal dumping of chemical waste at Sungai Kim Kim in Pasir Gudang. We have not detected any pollution impacts on Singapore's air and water quality or water supply.The National Environment Agency (NEA) continuously monitors the ambient concentration of a variety of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) at our air monitoring stations, including at four stations located in the north-eastern region of Singapore. These include benzene, toluene, and xylene, as well as other common VOCs from industrial emissions which are also closely monitored by other environmental agencies such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). NEA has not detected any elevated levels of VOCs. The 24-hour Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) has also been in the Good to Low-Moderate range, while the one-hour PM2.5 readings remained in the Normal range. The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) has also deployed its portable stand-off chemical gas detectors at the northeast region of Singapore to detect toxic chemicals, and has not detected any toxic chemicals in the air. For water quality, NEA's continuous buoy-based coastal water quality monitoring sensors deployed along the Straits of Johor have not detected any unusual variation in the key physical, chemical, and microbiological water quality parameters. NEA has also taken the additional step of collecting water samples at Pulau Ubin and its vicinity to test additional parameters, including compounds Malaysia has identified due to the chemical waste dumped in Sungai Kim Kim. These compounds have not been detected in our water samples. NEA has also not detected any anomalies in the quality of the waters at our recreational coastal beaches.The Public Utilities Board (PUB)'s online sensors have shown that the water quality of Johor River, our waterways and reservoirs in the north and north-eastern part of Singapore, as well as the water supply is within normal variations. On-site inspections and water quality checks have also shown no abnormalities. As a precautionary measure, PUB has installed oil booms at the outlet drains and estuaries along the north and north-eastern coast of Singapore. This incident has no impact on our water supply as the chemical dumping location is outside of our Johor River catchment area, where part of our water supply comes from. There have been no reports of unusual fish mortality at our local fish farms in the Straits of Johor. Singapore Food Agency (SFA)'s tests of seafood samples from these fish farms for compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), VOCs, and heavy metals have not detected any anomalies.We will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates if there are any significant developments. We will also continue to step up our checks and enforcement, to protect our environment and safeguard the health and safety of Singaporeans."
statistics on women not in labour force due to care-giving duties to family or relatives,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the current number of women who are out of the labour force because of their care-giving duties to family or relatives; (b) what is the average period they remained out of the labour force; (c) when such women re-enter the labour force, what are their labour market outcomes, disaggregated by employment type, age, and industry; and (d) to what extent do such women experience changes in income relative to their pre-caregiving income or to their non-caregiving peers.","Mrs Josephine Teo: Based on the Ministry of Manpower (MOM)'s 2018 Comprehensive Labour Force Survey (CLFS), of the 543,500 female residents aged 25 and above who are not in the labour force, about two in three cited non-care-giving reasons, such as retirement, poor health/disability/old age and housework. About one in four cited care-giving to families (including childcare) or relatives as the main reasons they are out of the labour force. Those providing care-giving to families (excluding childcare) or relatives are generally older – 75% are aged 50 and above. Majority had work experience; the median length of time since they left their jobs was nine years. Vast majority of those who are providing childcare are aged between 30 and 49. Most had prior work experience; the median length of time they have not been working was five years. As survey respondents are different each year, the CLFS does not track the subsequent labour market outcomes of those who re-enter the labour force. To support the return of females back into the labour force, the Adapt and Grow initiative by MOM and Workforce Singapore (WSG) offers a suite of job matching services and programmes to help jobseekers overcome mismatches in skills, wages or job expectations. One of the programmes is Career Trial, which provides opportunities for jobseekers to try out jobs and assess new careers. This year, we are enhancing Career Trial to include part-time jobs. This will benefit women who are considering part-time jobs, in particular those with care-giving responsibilities. "
criteria for tender evaluation under price quality method framework to tap on construction productivity and capability fund for public sector construction projects,"Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for National Development whether BCA, in determining the productivity scoring for public sector construction project tenders under the Price Quality Method framework of tender evaluation, can revise the Technology Adoption Index and Workforce Development Index which are now predicated solely on how much the tenderers tap on the Construction Productivity and Capability Fund so as to ensure tenderers only tap on the Fund when they have a need to do so.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Under the Price Quality Method framework, the assessed productivity of the contractor accounts for 10% of the overall evaluation score. A major part of this assessment is based on the contractor's track record in employing productive construction methods in past projects. In addition, a small weightage is assigned to the contractors' take-up of the relevant schemes under the Construction Productivity and Capability Fund (CPCF), which serves as a proxy for their investments in productivity improvements. BCA will continue to review and update the evaluation criteria, including the use of other suitable indicators.  "
waiting list for season parking at heavy vehicle parking lots at bukit batok east avenue 2 and bukit batok road (jurong road),Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the current number of applicants in the waiting list for season parking at the heavy vehicle parking lots at Bukit Batok East Avenue 2 and Bukit Batok Road (Jurong Road); (b) what is the average waiting period for applicants applying for lots at the abovementioned spaces before they successfully obtain season parking; and (c) what are the closest alternative parking areas to the abovementioned parking lots and how far away are those spaces.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: As of March 2019, there were 268 and 116 applicants on the wait lists for the heavy vehicle parks at Batok East Avenue 2 and Bukit Batok (Jurong Road) respectively. The waiting time will vary depending on how many drivers give up their parking spaces, the length of waitlist, and the number of spaces for each parking place.   However, there are vacant heavy vehicle parking spaces in the area. Based on the information on the Land Transport Authority (LTA)’s one-motoring website, as of February 2019, there were 353 available lots in Bukit Batok, Clementi, Jurong East and Jurong West. The nearest available lots are about 2 km away."
update on redevelopment plan for hdb flats at dakota crescent,Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether the redevelopment plan for the HDB flats at Dakota Crescent has been finalised; and (b) whether HDB can share its plans for the six HDB blocks within Dakota Crescent that are being retained.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Dakota Crescent estate will be redeveloped for public housing. The plans and design are being worked out, and more details will be shared when ready.Agencies are also in active discussion with potential community users on the usage of the six former Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT) blocks that will be retained. The ground level could be activated for community uses, while the upper storeys could be used for accommodation, for example as a students' hostel. Interested parties are conducting feasibility studies on the suitability of these blocks. We will share more information with stakeholders after these studies are completed."
extension of fresh start housing scheme to bigger flats for big families,"Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for National Development whether the Fresh Start Housing Scheme, which currently covers the purchase of short-lease 2-room flexi flats, may be extended to allow persons with bigger families such as those with three or more children to purchase bigger flats on short-term leases.","Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB offers 2-room Flexi flats on shorter leases under the Fresh Start Housing Scheme to make home ownership more affordable for second-timer families with young children who are living in public rental flats. Many of these families already face challenges in affording the 2-room Flexi flats, even with the shorter leases and the Fresh Start Housing Grant. Hence, it would be even more difficult for them to purchase a bigger flat. We want to encourage home ownership for these families, but this has to be done in a sustainable way without overstretching their finances."
"total area in singapore used for housing, industries, parks, nature reserves and water catchment","Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for National Development as a percentage of the land area of Singapore, what is the total area used respectively for (i) public housing (ii) private housing (iii) industrial land and (iv) parks, nature reserves and water catchment.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Of the total land area of Singapore, approximately (i) 8% is used for public housing; (ii) 7% is used for private housing, largely in areas zoned for low-rise and low-density land use; (iii) 13% is used for industry; and (iv) 14% is used for parks, nature reserves, nature areas and waterbodies. "
increase in number of eligible voters for each grc and smc,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Prime Minister based on the latest update to the Registers of Electors (a) which GRC has the highest increase in the number of eligible voters; and (b) what is the increase in the number of eligible voters for each GRC and SMC.,"Mr Lee Hsien Loong: Based on the Registers of Electors as at 1 February 2019, the GRC with the largest increase in number of electors is Pasir Ris-Punggol.The increase in the number of eligible voters for each GRC and SMC is shown in the table below:"
"ethnicity of singapore residents listed under ""others"" in ethnic category","Ms Anthea Ong asked the Prime Minister for each year in 2017 and 2018 (a) how many Singapore residents are listed under ""Others"" in the ethnic category of official documents such as birth certificates and NRICs; (b) what are all the ethnicities and their numbers that make up ""Others""; and (c) what is the percentage for each of the categories in the Chinese-Malay-Indian-Others (CMIO) model.","Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): Table 1 below shows the ethnic composition of the Singapore citizen population in 2017 and 2018. Table 2 below shows the number of Singapore citizens listed under the ""Others"" ethnic category in 2017 and 2018. Table 3 below shows the breakdown of the six prevalent ethnicities in the citizen population under ""Others"", based on the latest available data from the General Household Survey of 2015."
regulations in place governing release and publication of prejudicial information on ongoing criminal investigations and proceedings,"Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what regulations or guidelines are in place to ensure that law enforcement agencies and the media do not release or publish prejudicial information about suspects that can undermine due process in ongoing criminal investigations and proceedings; and (b) whether the prior criminal history and out-of-court records of the suspect who allegedly uploaded videos of the Prime Minister's son in March 2019 have been divulged to the media by the police or other public agency or official and, if so, why.","Mr K Shanmugam: Ms Lim's questions refer to the incident where Mr Li Yipeng was taken for a ride on 15 March 2019.The man was driving a private, rented car. The car was not licensed for ride-sharing. Five months earlier, in November 2018, Grab had terminated the man's contract for driving a private hire car without proper decals and also for suspected touting. Since the man did not have a car licensed to pick up passengers, he could not, (amongst other things), pick up passengers from the roadside. The man recognised Mr Li as the Prime Minister's son. He picked up Mr Li who was waiting for a hail taxi. Mr Li is a vulnerable person. It is public knowledge that Mr Li has Asperger's syndrome, a mild form of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) characterised by significant difficulties in social interaction and in non-verbal communication. This is compounded by Mr Li's albinism, which results in his having very poor eyesight.The driver then filmed his interactions with Mr Li using his handphone, apparently while driving, and subsequently circulated the videos. In the confined setting of his car, the man can be heard (in a video), repeatedly asking Mr Li to confirm his identity, residential address and security arrangements. Leaving aside Mr Li's background, it is very troubling when an individual picks up any vulnerable person, whether adult or child, and puts that person in such a situation. I am sure the Member, like most people, will be deeply concerned by what happened. The man put Mr Li in an uncomfortable situation, apparently exploited the situation, filmed it, and then circulated it.   The videos came to the Police's attention. The man’s conduct in the videos showed, prima facie, infractions of the law. Police began investigations immediately. In addition to the infractions, the Police were concerned from the security perspective as well, for a number of reasons. The man made repeated references to Rochalie Drive, and pressed Mr Li on the security arrangements at PM's home. The questions he asked showed that he already knew Mr Li's identity. The man had picked up Mr Li without possessing a street hailing licence, and he had criminal antecedents:(a) A conviction in 2014 for taking a vehicle without owner’s consent under the Road Traffic Act;(b) With the offence of Driving a Motor Vehicle without Insurance in respect to Third-Party Risks under the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act taken into consideration;(c) A warning for theft in dwelling in 2002; and,(d) A report made against him for criminal intimidation in 2014.When asked by the media, the Police confirmed these investigations. The Minister for Home Affairs directed the Police to state the man's antecedents, without disclosing his name.It was in the public interest for the Police to give a fuller explanation and background why they were investigating the matter. If the Police did not set out their security concerns, the public may not grasp why the Police were investigating the matter, and may even misunderstand the Police's actions. It was important to provide the public relevant and specific facts, in order to maintain public confidence in the Police Force. The Member has also asked about Rules and Guidelines on what information can be published. Police decisions on what information to disclose are guided by existing legal requirements. With the proliferation of social media, public agencies will from time to time need to release information faster than used to be the case. It may not always be possible in all cases to wait for a trial to commence or be concluded, a process which may take weeks or months, before releasing relevant facts to the public. When the Police assess that it is necessary to release information earlier, they will do so, while being careful not to prejudice any investigations or legal proceedings that may follow. "
singapore medical council's appeal against its disciplinary tribunal's sentence on dr soo shuenn chiang,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Law in the recent case of the Singapore Medical Council appealing against its disciplinary tribunal's sentence, how did the memo containing confidential health information written by Dr Soo Shuenn Chiang for a patient, falsely obtained by the patient's brother posing as the patient's husband, come to be accepted by the court for the patient's brother to obtain a personal protection order against the patient.","Mr K Shanmugam: The Member asks about why the Court accepted a document in evidence. The Courts make their decisions independently. We will know the reasons for a decision, if they give the reasons in a judgment. There was also no conclusion or finding made by the Singapore Medical Council Disciplinary Tribunal (DT) as to whether the memorandum was admitted into evidence or relied on by the court in granting the Personal Protection Order (PPO). The DT observed that there was ""no clear evidence"" that the PPO had been granted because of the disclosure of the memorandum. At the very most, the facts showed that the memorandum had been produced in the application for a PPO (see Singapore Medical Council v Dr Soo Shuen Chiang [2018] SMCDT 11 at [25]).PPO proceedings are held in the Family Justice Courts (FJC). Proceedings in FJC are conducted in camera. Likewise in this case. In addition, FJC had not issued its grounds of decision. There is thus no appeal filed by either party to the PPO proceedings. Therefore, there are no publicly-known facts as to whether the memorandum was indeed admitted into evidence or relied on by FJC.The Singapore Medical Council has taken steps to pursue an appeal against the DT's decision. On appeal, the Court could possibly look into the surrounding facts, including the circumstances in which the memorandum was procured. Further, whether the memorandum was accepted by FJC, and the weight FJC placed on it in granting the PPO are issues that may also potentially arise on appeal."
statistics on business e-mail compromise scams and measures to educate potential victims,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is the number of business e-mail compromise scams in the last five years; (b) what have been the financial losses in total and how much has been recovered; and (c) whether there are plans to better educate potential victims of such business e-mail compromise scams.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The number of business e-mail impersonation scams has increased over the past five years, from 98 cases in 2014 to 378 cases in 2018. The amount cheated has increased in tandem, from about $11 million in 2014 to about $57 million in 2018. The Police do not track the amount of money recovered from scams. Whenever monies are recovered, Police will apply to the Courts to have them returned to the rightful owners. These scams are usually conducted by overseas criminal syndicates, and thus it is not easy to recover the monies.  The Police have been working with stakeholders, such as the Singapore Business Federation, Singapore International Chamber of Commerce, Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants, and the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority to step up public education on business e-mail impersonation scams. These efforts include sending out advisories in email broadcasts to members, disseminating pamphlets during outreach events, and posting of advisories on their web portals and social media platforms. The Police have also sent out advisory messages to about 80,000 individual businesses.The Police have also set up an Anti-Scam Helpline (1800-722-6688) and the www.scamalert.sg website. Businesses and members of the public are encouraged to visit the website to learn about the various types of scam and the steps to take to avoid becoming a victim."
evaluation framework for grounding and review of aircraft operating in singapore,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the Ministry's evaluation framework and process in deciding whether to ground a particular model of aircraft; and (b) how are aircraft types regularly reviewed before they are allowed to operate in Singapore.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) evaluates an aircraft type for operation to Singapore based on an established framework that is in accordance with international regulations and processes. It includes assessments of the aircraft design, the maturity of the technologies used, and the resolution of all known safety issues with the aircraft. The evaluation is carried out by a multi-disciplinary team of CAAS officers, including engineers and officers with pilot qualifications. After an aircraft is approved for operation to Singapore, CAAS continues to review the reliability and airworthiness of in-service aircraft through regular inspections, monitoring of technical defects and incidents, and review of safety information provided by aircraft manufacturers, airline operators and counterpart regulatory authorities. CAAS will ground an aircraft type if it determines that the continued operation of the aircraft presents a safety risk."
update on usage of chas card at gp clinics,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Health since the CHAS card was first introduced, how many residents have visited GP clinics, by number and percentage of increase, using the CHAS card for subsidised medical treatment instead of visiting the polyclinics.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) was introduced in 2012. It provides subsidies for Singapore Citizens who are CHAS and/or Pioneer Generation (PG) cardholders and, in future, Merdeka Generation (MG) cardholders, for medical and dental care at participating private General Practitioner (GP) and dental clinics.Since the scheme's introduction, the number of cardholders who benefitted from CHAS medical subsidies in a given year increased by nine times, from about 60,000 in 2012 to about 550,000 in 2018."
productivity extraction factor for fare revision framework to consider operating profits from retail operations of public transport operators,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Transport whether the current Productivity Extraction Factor for the Fare Revision Framework takes into consideration operating profits from retail operations of the public transport operators.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The Productivity Extraction factor in the fare formula is designed to allow the productivity gains of the public transport operators (PTOs) to be shared with commuters through lower fare adjustments. Productivity gains are measured in terms of the change in value-add per employee, and takes into consideration the PTOs' operating profits, including the profits from their retail operations."
progress on installation of electric vehicle charging points across singapore,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Transport whether he can update the House on the progress and timeline for installing 2,000 electric vehicle charging points across Singapore.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The BlueSG electric car-sharing programme is jointly supported by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and the Economic Development Board (EDB). Under this programme, BlueSG has committed to roll out a total of 500 charging stations equipped with 2,000 charging points nationwide by end-2020. To date, BlueSG has installed 178 charging stations and 703 charging points."
complaints of gender-related discrimination reported in last three years,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Manpower (a) in each of the last three years, how many complaints of gender-related discrimination have been reported; (b) what is the breakdown of complaints by major reasons such as pregnancy, sexual harassment, unequal pay or work opportunities, or other gender-related reasons; and (c) what actions have been taken in category of complaints including any penalties meted out to employers.","Mrs Josephine Teo: In the past three years, there were on average about 50 gender-related discrimination complaints reported to the Tripartite Alliance on Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) and Ministry of Manpower (MOM) annually, constituting 12% of the total number of complaints each year. The vast majority of these 50 complaints related to employers specifying their preference for a particular gender in their recruitment advertisements. About half of these were substantiated following investigations; as a result, MOM imposed sanctions on the employers, such as curtailing their work pass privileges. For the rest, investigations did not substantiate the complaints. In the last three years, TAFEP received an average of about 10 workplace harassment complaints each year. For workplace harassment complaints which do not disclose a criminal offence, TAFEP notifies the employers and advises them to handle the complaint as an internal workplace matter by conducting an investigation, taking corrective actions and setting up mechanisms to handle future complaints appropriately, as outlined in the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices (TGFEP). All the employers so notified had conducted the necessary enquiries and instituted the appropriate corrective measures. Hence, TAFEP has not needed to impose any sanctions on employers for refusing to take action. MOM also received about 70 pregnancy-related dismissal appeals annually in the past three years. This includes appellants who felt that they were wrongfully dismissed or forced to resign, or denied of maternity benefits. The number of cases that were substantiated and resulted in compensation to the employees remained relatively stable at about 50 per year. The other 20 cases were either dismissed as they were not substantiated or withdrawn by the employees. MOM takes a serious view of workplace discrimination, including discrimination on the grounds of gender. We expect all employers to comply with our legislation, and abide by the principles of fair and merit-based employment practices outlined in the TGFEP. We urge all individuals who feel that they have been discriminated against to approach TAFEP and MOM for advice and assistance. MOM will not hesitate to take strong actions against errant employers."
number of workers misclassified as self-employed persons in last three years,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Manpower (a) for each of the last three years, how many workers have been misclassified as self-employed persons when they should be classified as employees; (b) what are the major sectors or jobs where such misclassification has occurred; (c) whether there are links between emerging technologies or business models and self-employment misclassification; and (d) what are the actions taken to resolve misclassification including any penalties meted out to employers.","Mrs Josephine Teo: In the last three years, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and Central Provident Fund (CPF) Board received a total of 308 cases of suspected misclassification. In 160 cases, workers were assessed to be misclassified as self-employed persons (SEPs)1. Each case that MOM and CPF Board investigate into could involve more than one worker. On average, about 100 workers per year were found to be misclassified. In all but two of these misclassification cases, employers made good their obligations when informed of the misclassification, and paid back the affected employees what they were due, including overtime pay and CPF contributions. Penalties including warning and late payment interest charges were meted out to the companies. The two companies which refused to make the necessary payments to the affected employees were prosecuted. One subsequently fully settled the arrears out of Court while the other is currently appealing against its conviction. The majority of these cases occurred in the contract labour suppliers, transport and logistics, construction and education sectors. The common occupations where such misclassification occurred include promoters, drivers, crane operators, service agents and carpenters. The proportion of SEPs has remained stable at 8-10% of the resident workforce over the last decade. We have not observed a link between emerging technologies or business models and self-employment misclassification."
number of singaporeans above age 65 who have made use of skillsfuture credits,Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Education (a) what is the number of Singaporeans above the age of 65 who have made use of SkillsFuture credits; (b) what are the types of courses which they use the credits for; and (c) what are existing efforts in encouraging use of credits amongst the elderly.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: As of end 2018, more than 58,000 Singaporeans aged 65 and above have started using their SkillsFuture Credit.The courses which they most commonly used their SkillsFuture Credit for were in ICT, productivity & innovation, personal development, and leadership & people management.SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) works with partner agencies to ensure there is a suitable range of affordable SkillsFuture Credit-eligible courses designed specifically for seniors. These include IT courses at various levels of proficiencies and learning opportunities under the National Silver Academy offered by community-based organisations. Individuals can also attend the SkillsFuture Advice workshops organised by the Community Development Councils, which cater to all ages including seniors."
time taken to conclude a divorce at family justice courts and syariah court,Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Law (a) what is the average amount of time taken to conclude a civil divorce at the Family Justice Courts (FJC); (b) what is the average amount of time taken to conclude a divorce at the Syariah Court (SYC); and (c) whether there has been an increase in the number of divorce cases filed (both in FJC and SYC) in 2017/ 2018 as opposed to 2015/2016.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The average time taken to conclude a civil divorce at the FJC, where parties consent to the divorce and agree on all issues relating to the divorce, is about four months. Where a divorce is contested, the average time taken to conclude the case is about eight months.On average, cases at the SYC are concluded within six months or less on average if parties consent to the divorce and agree on all issues relating to the divorce. Where a divorce is contested, it is concluded, on average, within one year from the date of filing the divorce application.Compared to 2015 and 2016, there has not been an increase in the number of divorce cases filed in 2017 and 2018. This applies to divorce cases filed both in the FJC and the SYC."
"total area in singapore used for housing, industries, parks, nature reserves and water catchment","Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for National Development as a percentage of the land area of Singapore, what is the total area used respectively for (i) public housing (ii) private housing (iii) industrial land and (iv) parks, nature reserves and water catchment.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Of the total land area of Singapore, approximately (i) 8% is used for public housing; (ii) 7% is used for private housing, largely in areas zoned for low-rise and low-density land use; (iii) 13% is used for industry; and (iv) 14% is used for parks, nature reserves, nature areas and waterbodies.

complaints of gender-related discrimination reported in last three years,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Manpower (a) in each of the last three years, how many complaints of gender-related discrimination have been reported; (b) what is the breakdown of complaints by major reasons such as pregnancy, sexual harassment, unequal pay or work opportunities, or other gender-related reasons; and (c) what actions have been taken in category of complaints including any penalties meted out to employers.","Mrs Josephine Teo: In the past three years, there were on average about 50 gender-related discrimination complaints reported to the Tripartite Alliance on Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) and Ministry of Manpower (MOM) annually, constituting 12% of the total number of complaints each year. The vast majority of these 50 complaints related to employers specifying their preference for a particular gender in their recruitment advertisements. About half of these were substantiated following investigations; as a result, MOM imposed sanctions on the employers, such as curtailing their work pass privileges. For the rest, investigations did not substantiate the complaints. In the last three years, TAFEP received an average of about 10 workplace harassment complaints each year. For workplace harassment complaints which do not disclose a criminal offence, TAFEP notifies the employers and advises them to handle the complaint as an internal workplace matter by conducting an investigation, taking corrective actions and setting up mechanisms to handle future complaints appropriately, as outlined in the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices (TGFEP). All the employers so notified had conducted the necessary enquiries and instituted the appropriate corrective measures. Hence, TAFEP has not needed to impose any sanctions on employers for refusing to take action. MOM also received about 70 pregnancy-related dismissal appeals annually in the past three years. This includes appellants who felt that they were wrongfully dismissed or forced to resign, or denied of maternity benefits. The number of cases that were substantiated and resulted in compensation to the employees remained relatively stable at about 50 per year. The other 20 cases were either dismissed as they were not substantiated or withdrawn by the employees. MOM takes a serious view of workplace discrimination, including discrimination on the grounds of gender. We expect all employers to comply with our legislation, and abide by the principles of fair and merit-based employment practices outlined in the TGFEP. We urge all individuals who feel that they have been discriminated against to approach TAFEP and MOM for advice and assistance. MOM will not hesitate to take strong actions against errant employers."
number of workers misclassified as self-employed persons in last three years,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Manpower (a) for each of the last three years, how many workers have been misclassified as self-employed persons when they should be classified as employees; (b) what are the major sectors or jobs where such misclassification has occurred; (c) whether there are links between emerging technologies or business models and self-employment misclassification; and (d) what are the actions taken to resolve misclassification including any penalties meted out to employers.","Mrs Josephine Teo: In the last three years, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and Central Provident Fund (CPF) Board received a total of 308 cases of suspected misclassification. In 160 cases, workers were assessed to be misclassified as self-employed persons (SEPs)1. Each case that MOM and CPF Board investigate into could involve more than one worker. On average, about 100 workers per year were found to be misclassified. In all but two of these misclassification cases, employers made good their obligations when informed of the misclassification, and paid back the affected employees what they were due, including overtime pay and CPF contributions. Penalties including warning and late payment interest charges were meted out to the companies. The two companies which refused to make the necessary payments to the affected employees were prosecuted. One subsequently fully settled the arrears out of Court while the other is currently appealing against its conviction. The majority of these cases occurred in the contract labour suppliers, transport and logistics, construction and education sectors. The common occupations where such misclassification occurred include promoters, drivers, crane operators, service agents and carpenters. The proportion of SEPs has remained stable at 8-10% of the resident workforce over the last decade. We have not observed a link between emerging technologies or business models and self-employment misclassification."
number of singaporeans above age 65 who have made use of skillsfuture credits,Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Education (a) what is the number of Singaporeans above the age of 65 who have made use of SkillsFuture credits; (b) what are the types of courses which they use the credits for; and (c) what are existing efforts in encouraging use of credits amongst the elderly.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: As of end 2018, more than 58,000 Singaporeans aged 65 and above have started using their SkillsFuture Credit.The courses which they most commonly used their SkillsFuture Credit for were in ICT, productivity & innovation, personal development, and leadership & people management.SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) works with partner agencies to ensure there is a suitable range of affordable SkillsFuture Credit-eligible courses designed specifically for seniors. These include IT courses at various levels of proficiencies and learning opportunities under the National Silver Academy offered by community-based organisations. Individuals can also attend the SkillsFuture Advice workshops organised by the Community Development Councils, which cater to all ages including seniors."
time taken to conclude a divorce at family justice courts and syariah court,Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Law (a) what is the average amount of time taken to conclude a civil divorce at the Family Justice Courts (FJC); (b) what is the average amount of time taken to conclude a divorce at the Syariah Court (SYC); and (c) whether there has been an increase in the number of divorce cases filed (both in FJC and SYC) in 2017/ 2018 as opposed to 2015/2016.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The average time taken to conclude a civil divorce at the FJC, where parties consent to the divorce and agree on all issues relating to the divorce, is about four months. Where a divorce is contested, the average time taken to conclude the case is about eight months.On average, cases at the SYC are concluded within six months or less on average if parties consent to the divorce and agree on all issues relating to the divorce. Where a divorce is contested, it is concluded, on average, within one year from the date of filing the divorce application.Compared to 2015 and 2016, there has not been an increase in the number of divorce cases filed in 2017 and 2018. This applies to divorce cases filed both in the FJC and the SYC."
"fire hazards posed by use of lithium-ion batteries for electric bicycles, pmds and electric devices","Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether the lithium-ion batteries used by electric bicycles, PMDs and other electric devices should be designated as controlled goods under the Consumer Protection (Safety Requirements) Regulations to reduce the increasing incidences of fire caused by their charging.","Mr Chan Chun Sing: Electrical devices such as Power Assisted Bicycles (""PABs"") and motorised Personal Mobility Devices (""PMDs"") should be tested for their safety as a whole, rather than having components such as lithium-ion batteries tested in isolation. Unlike most consumer electrical devices, PMDs and PABs are exposed to harsher conditions such as wet weather and uneven ground. In this regard, the testing of the device as a whole, takes into consideration of how the overall design and materials used are able to withstand expected operating conditions of the device.To safeguard fire safety risks, the Land Transport Authority (""LTA"") announced earlier that it will require all motorised PMDs intended for use on public paths to be certified to the UL2272 standard from 1 January 2021. PABs that are approved after 1 February 2016 for use on public road and paths are also required to adhere to the EN15194 standard. Both the UL2272 and EN15194 standards can improve the fire and electrical safety of PMDs and PABs respectively.Enterprise Singapore (""ESG"") oversees the product safety of 33 categories of common household appliances, including power adaptors used to charge PABs and motorised PMDs through the Consumer Protection (Safety Requirements) Regulations (""CPSR""). These goods have to be registered with ESG, and affixed with the Safety Mark before they can be sold in Singapore. In addition, ESG administers the Consumer Protection (Consumer Goods Safety Requirements) Regulations (""CGSR""), which requires general consumer products not regulated under any other legislations to meet applicable international or regional safety standards. ESG conducts post-market testing, and suppliers found with non compliant products will be asked to rectify or stop sale.Consumers should also be aware that the usage of every product will carry inherent risks. We strongly encourage consumers to exercise vigilance when purchasing and charging electrical devices. When purchasing PABs and PMDs, consumers should buy from reputable sources and be alert to prices which look too good to be true. Besides ensuring that the Safety Mark is on the adaptor, consumers should also avoid overcharging or tampering with the electrical components of their devices."
update on review on getting more companies to offer neo-natal insurance for in-vitro fertilisation,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry can provide an update on the review it is conducting on getting more companies to offer neo-natal insurance for in-vitro fertilisation.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Assisted Reproduction Programme (ARP) insurance scheme provides protection against unexpected cost of neonatal care incurred by babies conceived via in-vitro fertilisation (IVF), in the event that specialised care is required. It provides a cash benefit of $150 or $300 per day, if the baby is admitted to a Special Care Nursery or a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) respectively. Since 1994, couples are required to purchase ARP insurance when they enroll for IVF, as MediShield did not previously cover neonatal conditions.With the introduction of MediShield Life, it now provides universal coverage for all Singapore Citizens (SC) from birth. It provides coverage of up to $700 per day of normal ward hospitalisation and $1,200 per day of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) hospitalisation. The MediSave Grant for Newborns (MGN), introduced since 2012, can also be used to offset hospitalisation costs, up to the MediSave withdrawal limits of $450 per day. We will also be extending MediShield Life coverage to serious pregnancy or delivery complications, which will take effect from 1 April 2019.MOH has therefore decided to remove the requirement for couples to purchase ARP insurance before undergoing IVF, effective 1 April 2019. Insurers may continue to offer ARP insurance or similar products, if they assess that there is sufficient demand. Couples who wish to have additional coverage beyond MediShield Life and MediSave, can still purchase ARP insurance or other maternity insurance plans in the private insurance market to meet their needs."
ul2272 fire safety standards for all pmds,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked ask the Minister for Transport (a) whether the electric bicycles and PMDs involved in the 74 fires in 2018 would have passed the UL2272 fire safety standards; and (b) what steps are taken by LTA to reduce the incidence of such fires before the implementation of UL2272 standards for all PMDs by 2021.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: To improve public safety and reduce the risk of fire incidents for power assisted bicycles (PABs) and personal mobility devices (PMDs), the Land Transport Authority (LTA) is progressively introducing new standards to improve the fire and electrical safety of these devices. In 2016, we introduced a requirement that only PABs that are compliant with the EN15194 standard can be approved for use and sold in Singapore. From 1 July 2019 onwards, only UL2272-certified motorised PMDs can be sold in Singapore for use on public paths. From 1 January 2021 onwards, all motorised PMDs used on public paths will be required to be certified to the UL2272 standard.In 2018, there were 22 PAB-related fires and 52 PMD-related fires. Based on information available to the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) and LTA, none of the PABs or PMDs involved in the fires are known to be certified to the EN15194 or UL2272 standards respectively.Even before the implementation of the UL2272 standard by 2021, we strongly encourage PMD owners to switch to UL2272 certified devices in order to minimise the risk of fire incidents. When purchasing devices, consumers are advised to buy from reputable sources and look out for fire safety standards. Consumers should also avoid overcharging batteries, modifying their devices or tampering with the electrical components of their devices. We have included such advisory information in the Safe Riding Programme curriculum."
regulation of non-subsidised private daycare and homecare services,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Health (a) whether there are plans to tighten the regulation of private daycare and homecare services that do not receive Government subsidies as they currently do not have any mandatory minimum standards; and (b) whether daycare and formal homecare services should be licensed like childcare and nursing home services.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: As the home and community care sector grows over time, we will need to continually improve the quality and standards of home and day care services.Healthcare professionals working in the sector, such as doctors, nurses and therapists, are already subject to licensing by their respective professional bodies. They are held to strict professional standards in areas such as code of conduct, practice standards and competencies. In 2015, MOH, in consultation with the sector, also introduced developmental service guidelines for home and day care providers covering areas such as care delivery, staff training and staff qualifications.MOH will review the need for more formal regulation of the home and day care sector. We have provided for the future regulation of home and day care services within the scope of the upcoming Healthcare Services Act (HCSA). The specific timing, phasing and regulatory approach will need to be studied carefully as the sector is still nascent and evolving."
compensation for repair of damage caused by fire in neighbour's hdb flat,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for National Development what recourse do HDB flat owners have to seek help and compensation for the repair of damage caused by a fire and the putting out of a fire in their neighbour's flat.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Flat owners should ensure that their flat and its contents are insured against damage caused by fire. If there is no insurance coverage, then any compensation claims for repairs to the flat is a matter for the neighbours to resolve amongst themselves privately.HDB will assist to provide temporary accommodation to affected flat owners if they need this while their flat is being repaired. Needy flat owners who need assistance with the cost of essential repairs can also approach their Community Development Councils for help."
salary claims filed with employment claims tribunal,Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Manpower in 2017 and 2018 respectively (a) how many salary claims were filed by (i) local employees and (ii) foreign workers at the Employment Claims Tribunal; (b) how many court orders were issued to errant employers to settle salary claims by (i) local employees and (ii) foreign workers respectively; and (c) how many orders remained unpaid one month after the orders were issued.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: 85% of the claims filed under the Employment Claims Act (ECA) were resolved at the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM). The remaining 15% of the claimants were referred to the Employment Claims Tribunals (ECT), and of which 5% were withdrawn while 10% filed for adjudication. Two-thirds of the adjudicated claims resulted in money orders issued to employers to settle the salary claims; this proportion is similar for both local and foreign employees.Of the ECT orders issued, about half of the claimants received full payment from their employers. Another 16% reported partial payment, while 36% reported no payment. Cases that resulted in partial or no payment usually involved employers in financial difficulty, or large accumulated salary arrears before the employee reported to TADM. In 12 cases (1% of ECT orders), the employer wilfully refused to pay despite having the means to do so. MOM is investigating and prosecuting these employers. 129 low income claimants who did not fully recover their salaries received additional financial assistance through the Short Term Relief Fund or Migrant Workers' Assistance Fund.We encourage workers to approach TADM immediately when they have salary arrears. This improves the chances of full recovery, and prevents more workers from encountering the same problem."
employers prosecuted for failure to report work-related injuries,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Manpower in each of the past five years (a) how many employers have been prosecuted for failing to report a work-related injury; and (b) how many of these employers who failed to report a work-related injury have been punished with a fine and how many have been punished with imprisonment.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: Non-reporting occurs mostly because employers disputed that the injury was work-related, or was not informed of the injury. Before 2018, we focused on educating employers to have better systems to detect and surface injuries suffered by their employees, and to report injuries brought to their attention even if they believe the injuries were not work-related. Since the start of 2018, we have stepped up our enforcement efforts which led to an increase in the number of employers being taken to task for non-reporting.In addition to the 40 composition fine cases, a site manager was convicted in 2016 for attempting to cover up a workplace accident by abandoning the injured worker along an alley. The manager was jailed six months for the offence. There has been no other case of non-reporting which resulted in imprisonment."
occupational injury cases seen by private vis-à-vis restructured healthcare providers,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the current percentage of work injuries or occupational injury cases that are seen by private compared to restructured healthcare providers; and (b) what are the patterns (types of injuries, severity of injuries, sectors, occupations) seen by private compared to those seen by restructured healthcare providers.","Mrs Josephine Teo: In the past three years, around 75% of work injury cases have been seen by public healthcare institutions, while the remaining 25% have been seen by private healthcare providers.The industry and occupation profile of injured workers seen by the public healthcare institutions and private healthcare providers are similar.Nonetheless, a larger proportion of the cases handled by the public healthcare institutions involve serious injuries such as fractures, dislocations and crushing injuries, compared to the private healthcare providers. Correspondingly, private healthcare providers have a larger proportion of less serious cases, such as bruises and sprains, compared to public healthcare institutions."
most common methods used by employers to avoid reporting work-related injuries,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what are the most common methods used by employers to avoid reporting a work-related injury; and (b) what are the most common ways that instances of non-reporting of work-related injuries by employers are detected.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: Today, employers are required to report work injuries resulting in medical leave of more than 3 days, hospitalisation for at least 24 hours or death.Common reasons cited for delayed or non-reporting are (i) the employer did not agree that the injury was work-related; and (ii) the employee did not inform the employer of the work injury.Non-reporting of work injuries by employers are usually detected when an employee or his representative files an incident report to MOM."
"neighbours with behavioural or mental health problems who cause nuisance, inconvenience or pose hazards and dangers","Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth with reference to neighbours with behavioural or mental health problems that cause nuisance, inconvenience or pose hazards and dangers (a) what measures are in place to resolve the problems expeditiously; and (b) whether regulatory and enforcement powers need to be strengthened for the Community Mediation Centre and other related Government agencies, for the safety and well-being of residents.","Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: The safety of residents is a priority for the Government, and the Police will not hesitate to intervene where there is a threat to life and property.However, not all cases are of this severity, and there are other avenues to resolve these issues. Parties can seek mediation through a neutral third party, such as a grassroots leader, or approach the Community Mediation Centre (CMC) for help. Persons who suspect that their neighbours are displaying disturbing behaviours due to mental health issues can contact Agency for Integrated Care (AIC), which will assess and make the necessary referral for medical assistance and social support. Agencies, such as HDB and PA, grassroots leaders, voluntary welfare organisations and the AIC will come together to find a sustainable solution with the parties involved.Where community-based solutions are not sufficient, we have other laws and procedures that allow parties to deal with persons with mental health conditions who are posing disruption to the community.(a) If the person is becoming a risk to himself, or poses a danger to others, the Police can apprehend the person and take him to a doctor. The doctor will assess the person's mental health, and send the person to a psychiatric institution for treatment if necessary.(b) For intractable cases where parties are unable to resolve their disputes through voluntary mediation, parties can file a case with the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals (CDRT) as a last resort. The CDRT judge can order the parties to attend mandatory mediation or attend counselling, or fix the case for hearing if mediation and counselling are not suitable.(c) If a respondent breaches the CDRT's order, his affected neighbour can apply to CDRT for a Special Direction (SD) for the respondent to comply with the order. The CDRT can order a third party, such as the respondent's family member, to enter into a bond with conditions that the respondent goes for psychiatric assessment or treatment. If the respondent breaches the SD and is convicted, the court can call for a psychiatric assessment to determine whether it would be appropriate to make a Mandatory Treatment Order for the respondent to undergo psychiatric treatment."
calculation of norm costs of running long-term care services,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Health how does the Ministry calculate norm costs, defined as the Ministry's observed average costs of running Long Term Care services, which tend to be considerably lower than what Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs) claim are the real costs of service delivery, as reported in Lien Foundation's 2018 ""Care Where You Are"" report.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: MOH partners Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs) as well as private and public sector service providers in delivering long-term care services (LTC) for Singaporeans.To estimate the costs of providing different LTC services, MOH works with the service providers to conduct regular costing exercises. The costs are determined based on service requirements set out for each care service. The average of the costs across the long term care provided by different service providers, the ""Norm Cost"", is then used as a reference to determine the funding for the services.As care models, cost structures and productivity vary across service providers, some could have costs that are higher than the norm cost, while others could have costs that are lower.MOH provides means-tested subsidies of up to 80% for long term care services. Singaporeans who require additional help after the subsidies can apply for financial assistance such as MediFund. Some VWOs provide additional assistance to their clients through charity dollars raised. Some may also choose to provide additional facilities and services using their charity funds. To support VWOs in their fundraising efforts and encourage Singaporeans to give generously, the Government funded Community Silver Trust provides dollar for dollar matching for donations raised in the long term care sector."
"plans for unused former primary school, ex-neighbourhood police centre and decommissioned petrol station in woodlands town","Mr Ong Teng Koon asked the Minister for National Development (a) why are the former Marsiling Primary School next to 149 Woodlands Street 13, former Woodlands West Neighbourhood Police Centre next to 202 Marsiling Drive and the decommissioned Shell petrol station next to 215 Woodlands Lane vacant for such a long time; (b) whether there are any short-term plans for them; and (c) whether these buildings will be demolished and redeveloped as part of the Woodlands Town Masterplan.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Former school sites and other Government buildings that are no longer needed to serve their original purposes will be returned to the State for interim uses that are compatible with the surrounding uses until the land is required for other longer-term developments.The site next to 202 Marsiling Drive was only recently vacated in end 2018, while the other two sites next to 149 Woodlands Street 13 and 215 Woodlands Lane were returned to the State in 2017. URA is working with other government agencies to explore suitable interim uses for these sites.Agencies are also reviewing the longer-term development plans for the area, including all three sites. They will be reflected in URA's Draft Master Plan 2019 for the area, which will be exhibited to seek public comments soon."
total cost of providing long-term care in singapore in latest available financial year,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the total cost of providing long-term care in Singapore in FY2017/18 or the latest year available including nursing homes, daycare centres and formal homecare services; and (b) what percentage of this cost has been borne by (i) individuals (ii) the Government (iii) insurance (ElderShield) and (iv) charities respectively.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: The 2017 data will only be available later in 2019, as the data collection and compilation process spans across many government and non-government data sources.Based on the latest available data in 2016, Singapore's National Health Expenditure on long-term care, including both formal care and informal care-giving, was about $1.3 billion. About two-thirds of this was borne by the Government, and the remaining one-third was paid by private financing sources, which include insurance, charities and individual out-of-pocket payments. Due to constraints in the data, we are unable to provide further breakdown of these sources."
workers in cleaning sector on r1 (higher skilled) scheme,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Manpower in the last three years, what percentage of workers in the cleaning sector are on the R1 (higher skilled) scheme and what is the breakdown in terms of the nationalities of these workers.","Mrs Josephine Teo: Over the last three years, about 20% of the Work Permit Holders (WPHs) in the Cleaning sector were higher-skilled (R1) workers.The Ministry does not provide data on foreign workers with breakdown by nationality. "
recurrent costs of government's healthcare and long-term care expenditure,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Health (a) what percentage of the Government's healthcare expenditure and long-term care expenditure are recurrent costs respectively; and (b) what percentage of the Government's healthcare expenditure and long-term care expenditure are capital costs respectively.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Based on latest available data in 2016, the Government's Healthcare Expenditure was $9.3 billion, of which about 80% and 20% were on recurrent cost and capital costs respectively. Government expenditure in long term care was $830 million, of which about 70% and 30% were on recurrent and capital costs respectively."
impact of chronic stress,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Health what does health research show about the impact of chronic stress on (i) brain development (ii) cognitive ability and (iii) life satisfaction of individuals.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Stress is the body's reaction to challenges. It is a normal part of life and helps us to meet the everyday demands of life. However, extreme or chronic stress can be detrimental to health if it overwhelms an individual's ability to cope. Chronic stress in childhood such as adverse childhood experiences, has been linked with negative effects on brain development. This may put them at increased risk of developing mental disorders. In adults, chronic stress has been associated with impairment of various cognitive functions, such as memory and attention. While stress has been known to affect physical and emotional well-being, the physiological mechanisms through which this occur remains unclear. Life satisfaction is influenced by many factors. An optimistic outlook, strong relationships and a supportive environment are factors that can help build resilience that allows an individual to better cope with stress."
singapore's plastic waste for recycling,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources what are the countries that Singapore's plastic waste that are meant for recycling exported to in 2017, 2018 and this year respectively.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Across all three years, plastics collected for recycling that were not processed in our local plastic recycling facilities were sorted and exported to countries in Southeast Asia and the wider Asian region, such as China, India, Pakistan, Australia and South Korea."
amount of plastic waste produced in past five years,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) in each year of the past five years, how much plastic waste did Singapore produce; and (b) of this amount, how much were (i) incinerated (ii) recycled locally and (iii) exported to recyclers overseas respectively.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Singapore generated 832,200 tonnes of plastic waste in 2013, 869,000 tonnes in 2014, 824,600 tonnes in 2015, 822,200 tonnes in 2016 and 815,200 tonnes in 2017.Of the plastic waste generated, Singapore recycled 6% to 11% of it across the different years, with the rest being incinerated.In 2017, about 4% of the plastics collected for recycling were processed in our local plastic recycling facilities. The rest are sorted and exported for recycling."
claims under work injury compensation act by s pass and work permit holders in last three years,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Manpower in the last three years, what percentage of claims under the Work Injury Compensation Act made by S Pass and Work Permit holders are determined to be valid or invalid within (i) one month (ii) three months (iii) six months and (iv) longer than six months from the accident respectively.","Mrs Josephine Teo: Investigation on the validity of a work injury claim starts after we have received an incident report from the employee or his representatives.In 2018, 70% of the claims by S Pass and Work Permit Holders were determined to be valid or not within one month. For the remaining claims, determining validity took a longer time because of delays due to various parties.Common reasons for delays include incomplete information provided by the injured employee, difficulty in locating and getting witnesses to come forward, and having to wait for medical assessments of whether an injury occurred or not, in cases where injuries were not visible.For cases that took more than six months, they are mainly due to fraudulent claims investigation. These cases are complex and we want to conclusively establish whether they were work injuries, rather than prematurely ruling them as valid or invalid."
study on effects of streaming in secondary schools on students’ self-esteem and confidence,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Education whether the Ministry has studied the effects of streaming in secondary schools on the (i) self-esteem and (ii) confidence levels of students in each stream respectively.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: MOE introduced streaming in 1980 to systematically customise learning for students of different profiles. It has very successfully lowered student attrition and improved educational outcomes.Factors impacting self-esteem and confidence are complex and multi-faceted. NIE studies have shown that some Normal Academic students, after spending some years in secondary schools, were similar or more confident academically relative to some Express students. But there is also feedback from teachers that students in Normal Streams may over time also lose confidence and the mindset of growth and development.The trade-off between customisation and stigmatisation is something we need to recognise. That is why over the years, MOE has taken steps, through measures such as out-of-stream subjects, subject-based banding and the Polytechnic Foundation Programme, to blur the lines between education streams. Our work in this area is on-going."
"pathway for normal (technical) stream students who do well in gce n(t) level examination to take gce ""o"" level examination","Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Education (a) beyond just having subject banding as an option, whether the Ministry allows students from the Normal (Technical) stream who do well in their GCE ""N(T)"" Level examination to do their GCE ""O"" Level examination if they want to; (b) if so, how many of such students have there been to date; and (c) if not, whether the Ministry has plans to provide this pathway.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: Secondary 4 students in the Normal (Technical) [N(T)] course who perform well at the GCE N(T)-Level examination can laterally transfer to the Secondary 4 Normal (Academic) [N(A)] course and take the GCE N(A)-Level examination. Thereafter, they can progress further to Secondary 5 N(A) and sit for the GCE O-Level examination. This allows students to progressively bridge the gap between the academic demands of the N(T), N(A) and O-Level curricula.Over the last five years, an average of about 530 students per year transferred from the N(T) course to the N(A) course. They are identified early, based on their secondary school performance. Because of these early identification efforts, only a handful of students will transfer to the N(A) course after the GCE N(T)-Level examination every year. Of all the students who transfer from N(T) to N(A) course, 10 to 20 each year transferred further to the Express course."
number of cat-related nuisance feedback received by hdb in past 10 years,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for National Development (a) for each year in the past ten years, what is the number of cat-related nuisance feedback for common property areas that HDB has received involving (i) stray cats and (ii) owned cats living in someone else's residence respectively; and (b) whether such feedback has decreased in the Chong Pang constituency over the past 10 years.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Cat-related nuisance feedback in HDB estates is tracked by individual Town Councils. AVA, in its role as First Responder for animal-related feedback, receives cat-related nuisance feedback from across Singapore. AVA started tracking such cat-related feedback from 2016. Stray cat-related nuisance feedback across Singapore increased from around 2,300 cases in 2016 to 3,600 cases in 2018. Pet cat-related nuisance feedback increased from around 500 cases in 2016 to 900 cases in 2018. Cat nuisance feedback in Chong Pang constituency has remained relatively constant over the same period."
statistics on singapore children eligible for additional subsidy,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Social and Family Development for each of the last three years (a) what is the number of Singaporean children eligible for the Additional Subsidy for (i) full day childcare and (ii) full day infant care, by monthly household income and by per capita income eligibility bands, respectively; and (b) what is the number of Singaporean children actually receiving Additional Subsidy for each respective group.","Mr Desmond Lee: All parents of Singaporean children who attend child or infant care, regardless of their working status, are eligible for a Basic Subsidy. The number of parents eligible for an Additional Subsidy could not be ascertained by income bands until the parents choose to enrol their child in child or infant care, and apply for an Additional Subsidy.The total number of Singaporean children who received Additional Subsidy has increased by over 30% from 2016 to 2018 (see Tables 1 and 2 for breakdown by income tiers for children attending child care and infant care respectively).Apart from supporting parents through subsidies, we will continue to make quality preschools affordable through kindergartens run by the Ministry of Education, as well as preschools under the Anchor Operator and Partner Operator scheme, which are subject to fee caps. Other forms of support, such as the Baby Bonus Cash Gift and Child Development Account matched savings, are also available to help parents defray the cost of raising children."
self-employed persons receiving wis payouts from 2014 to 2018,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Manpower for each year from 2014 to 2018 and by Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) eligibility age group (a) what is the number and percentage of self-employed persons who receive WIS payouts; and (b) what is the average WIS payout received among self-employed persons.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: Table 1 shows the number and percentage of self-employed persons (SEPs) receiving Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) in each of the four WIS age bands, and Table 2 shows the average annual WIS payout received by SEPs for work done in 2014 to 2017.Information on WIS-SEP recipients for 2018 is not available yet as the SEPs can only be assessed for WIS eligibility and receive annual WIS payment after they have declared their net trade income for 2018 and made the required MediSave contributions by 31 December 2020."
profile of cpf members aged 65 and above receiving monthly payouts under retirement sum scheme and cpf life schemes,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the number and percentage of CPF members aged 65 and above receiving monthly payouts under the Retirement Sum Scheme and CPF LIFE Schemes, broken down by gender and size of HDB flat/private property type; (b) what are the average monthly payouts; (c) what percentage receive monthly payouts of less than $500; and (d) whether the Ministry will provide CPF microdata access to external researchers to facilitate research into retirement adequacy.","Mrs Josephine Teo: In December 2018, there were about 268,000 CPF members aged 65 and above who received retirement payouts from either the CPF LIFE or Retirement Sum Scheme. About half of these recipients are females. Among the 76% of members who are property owners, 17% own private property, 54% own 4-room-and-larger HDB flats while 29% own 3-room-and-under HDB flats.Of those who received payouts, 74% had monthly payouts under $500. The average monthly payouts differs greatly across the generations; the average monthly payout for CPF members aged 65 to 69 is more than double that of members aged 80 to 87.In addition to CPF payouts, members may receive additional retirement support from the Government through the Silver Support scheme. This provides them with an average income supplement of about $600 per quarter, which is in addition to the other forms of Government support such as the Workfare Income Supplement, GST vouchers and ComCare.With increased labour force participation and improvements to the CPF system made in the past decade, we expect younger cohorts to have higher CPF payouts. For example, about 6 in 10 active members turning age 55 in 2017 have at least the CPF Basic Retirement Sum (BRS) in their Retirement Accounts. The BRS of $83,000 at age 55 in 2017 will give members a monthly payout of about $700 to $750 for life.The Member also asked about sharing of CPF microdata. CPF Board aims to strike balance interests of external researchers with the need to safeguard members’ privacy. It is open to collaborating on research projects that can better inform the development of retirement adequacy policy. "
measures to address constituencies with declining population size and age,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Prime Minister (a) what has been the average size per household in each constituency for each of the past five years; and (b) what measures will the Government take to address the declining population in constituencies that face a shrinking population size and age.,"Mrs Josephine Teo (for the Prime Minister): The Government does not track the average household size by constituency on an ongoing basis.For planning purposes, the Government tracks the average household size by Planning Area. The average resident household size across Singapore has decreased from 3.53 in 2012 to 3.30 in 2017. Average resident household sizes by Planning Area are shown in Table 1.Agencies monitor population trends, such as the population size and age profile, to ensure adequate amenities and services in each Planning Area. For example, the Urban Redevelopment Authority’s geospatial planning tools enable the Ministry of Health to plan the locations of Senior Care Centres, by prioritising areas with a higher number of seniors with disabilities.In addition, the Housing and Development Board continues to build new flats in older estates, to ensure that all estates remain vibrant with a healthy mix of residents of different generations.The Government continues to monitor the distribution of the population across Planning Areas and take steps in a timely way to meet the different needs of Singaporeans."
personal data information lapse incidents reported and disclosed to public,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Prime Minister for each year from 2014 to 2018 inclusive (a) what is the number of Government personal data information security incidents reported to the police or the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC); (b) what proportion of cases have been disclosed to the public; (c) what proportion of cases have been disclosed to the affected individuals; and (d) what is the average duration that had elapsed between the incident date, internal confirmation of the incident, incident reporting to the police or PDPC, and disclosure to the public, respectively.","Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): Loss of personal data by Government agencies is reported to the police when there is suspected foul play, or when a physical asset such as a laptop is missing. Over the past three years, the Government made 41 such reports to the police. These reports have been made in a timely manner, with 80% submitted on the same day as the discovery of the incident. These incidents are not reported to the PDPC, as it is not their function to investigate such Government-related incidents. In seven of these 41 incidents, the individuals affected were notified. In another four of these incidents, both the individuals affected and the general public were informed. Among these 11 cases, it took an average of three weeks from the police report to notify the individual. This was the time taken to identify the exact individuals affected, and assess the extent of loss, to give an accurate report of the situation to the affected individuals, and to recover or safeguard evidence for potential future prosecution. The time required varies from case to case depending on the complexity of the incident.The remaining 30 police reports concern loss of physical assets such as laptops. No specific individual’s data was compromised. Government laptops are protected by encryption and laptops that are reported lost will be immediately blocked from the Government network. Nevertheless, a lost laptop remains a serious concern and the agency affected will work with the Police to make a best effort to recover it.From time to time, there are also incidents of data mishandling that are reported internally but not to the police. Such incidents typically involve the accidental mailing of letters containing personal information to the wrong recipient; or mass emails in which officers mistakenly included all recipients’ email addresses in the cc field rather than the bcc field. The affected agency will inform and apologise to the affected individuals, and follow up with the necessary staff education and discipline to avoid a future occurrence. Police assistance or intervention is not required."
"basis for admission of students into normal (technical), normal (academic) and express streams","Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Education (a) how does the Ministry decide what percentage of students are streamed into the Normal (Technical), Normal (Academic), and Express streams each year; and (b) whether the streaming system allows for the possibility that no students enter the Normal (Technical) or Normal (Academic) stream in a given year.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: The Ministry sets qualifying criteria based on PSLE result for the courses to ensure that students accessing each course can cope with its academic rigour and pace of learning. So the proportion of students in Normal (Technical), Normal (Academic), and Express course is dependent on students’ performance at the PSLE and their eligibility for the respective courses, and the students’ choices when they are eligible for two courses. The table below shows the placement criteria for each course and option band. The proportion of students in each course varies slightly from year to year. It is possible that in a cohort when more students meet the Express and Normal (Academic) criteria, we may end up having very few Normal (Technical) classes. This remains the case when we move to a new PSLE scoring system in 2021. "
success rate of appeals to use medisave beyond annual withdrawal limits,"Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for Health in each of the past two years (a) how many Singaporeans of 65 years old and above have exhausted their annual Medisave withdrawal limit for (i) outpatient treatments (ii) outpatient MRI/CT scans and diagnostics and (iii) flexible Medisave use, respectively; (b) how many appeals have been received from this group of seniors to use their Medisave beyond the annual withdrawal limits; and (c) what was the rate of successful appeals and the basis for these approvals.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: We recently increased the MediSave withdrawal limit under the Chronic Disease Management Programme from $400 to $500 and lowered the minimum age for Flexi-MediSave from 65 to 60 in June 2018. This has allowed more Singaporeans to tap on more of their MediSave for outpatient treatments. The statistics for 2018 are not yet available.  In 2016 and 2017, about 17% of Singaporeans aged 65 years old and above with chronic conditions and about 16% of those who used MediSave for outpatient diagnostic scans had fully utilised their respective MediSave limits. About 16% of Singaporeans of 65 years old and above had fully utilised their Flexi-MediSave limit.Over the past two years, MOH received about 200 appeals each year from all age groups for outpatient MediSave use. All appeals are considered on a case-by-case basis and we take into consideration exceptional circumstances such as whether more complex treatment is required due to unforeseen complications, or if the family is facing difficulties due to special social or financial circumstances. About half of the appeals were approved.MOH will continue to monitor the affordability of subsidised care, and regularly review the financing policies, including MediSave withdrawal limits. We will also continue to consider appeals for usage of Medisave above the withdrawal limits. Those who require further financial assistance could approach medical social workers at our public healthcare institutions.     "
regulations and frameworks involving firework displays,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what are the types of entities that are allowed to conduct firework displays in public spaces; and (b) what are the governing regulations and frameworks involved in such firework displays in ensuring public safety and avoiding any environmental risk.,"Mr K Shanmugam: There are six companies in Singapore that are exempted from the Dangerous Fireworks Act (“DFA”), which prohibits the possession, sale, transport, delivery, distribution, import or discharge of dangerous fireworks1. These companies deal with fireworks and pyrotechnic displays for indoor events, such as concerts, and outdoor events, such as the National Day Parade. Notwithstanding their exemption, the six companies are required to comply with strict conditions to ensure public safety, as stipulated under the Dangerous Fireworks (Exemption) Notification 2018. For instance, the fireworks must be certified safe and approved by the competent authority of the country of origin or manufacture, and by the manufacturer. There are also conditions pertaining to the storage of fireworks at the firing point, safety distances and direction of fire. The companies have maintained a good track record.Separately, ambient air and water quality monitoring by NEA and PUB have so far showed no long-term environmental impact of concern arising from fireworks displays.  "
progress on project e-learning mental health first aid programme,Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Health (a) how many persons have been trained and certified on the Project E-learning Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) programme since its launch in May 2017; (b) what is the profile of these participants; (c) how many of these certified participants on the central registry have been mobilised in 2017 and 2018 respectively; and (d) what type of cases have they been mobilised for.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The e-Learning Mental Health First Aid (Singapore) [MHFA(S)] was developed by Changi General Hospital (CGH) with funding from Temasek Foundation Cares to make mental health literacy more accessible through blended learning, that is, online learning with a half-day face-to-face practical session. As of November 2018, over 900 individuals from 26 organisations have attended this e-learning initiative. Of these, 94% (or more than 800) of the participants were certified by the MHFA(S) to have the knowledge to provide initial help to a person developing a mental health problem or in a mental health crisis until appropriate professional treatment is received or until the crisis resolves. The participants, who completed online and practical sessions, were mainly from government agencies, social organisations, educational institutions, grassroots organisations, and faith-based groups.While we do not have information regarding the activities of the trained participants, from informal feedback, CGH understands that their skills have been utilised to support their friends, co-workers and family members with mental health conditions."
measures in place to promote safe use of park connectors,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for National Development in the past year, what actions have been taken to promote the safe use of park connectors by users who are on foot, cyclists, and PMD users including safe and orderly adherence to the respective lane markings for users on foot and for ""PCN"" (Park Connector Network) users.","Mr Lawrence Wong: NParks works with its stakeholders and the community to promote the safe and orderly use of park connectors (PCs). First, NParks implements safety measures such as installing additional lighting, speed regulating strips, and advisory signs at high usage parks and park connectors. In 2018 alone, NParks installed over 2,000 advisory signs. Second, NParks conducts outreach programmes to raise awareness on PC etiquette, including the need for users to keep left and give way to others. For example, NParks and its volunteers produced and released the “PMDs in Our Parks” video on social media in May 2018. Third, NParks and LTA conduct joint enforcement efforts against errant Personal Mobility Device (PMD) users, such as those who exceed the speed limits or ride recklessly. In 2018, 56 enforcement exercises were conducted at popular parks and PCs."
update on removal of em3 stream in primary school,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Education with the removal of the EM3 stream in primary schools, what have been the effects on students, teachers and parents respectively.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: In 2008, MOE introduced Subject-Based Banding in primary schools, in place of streaming by the entire course. This enables the child to focus on and stretch his potential in subjects that he is strong in, while building up the fundamentals in the subjects that he needs more support in.Today, the great majority of students take up all Standard Subjects, or a combination of Standard and Foundation Subjects. We believe that this has helped raise the confidence and motivation of students, while customising education to their aptitudes and pace of learning.There are also more opportunities for interaction among students across the different subject combinations, as a form class can have students of several subject combinations. Concerns about labelling and stigmatisation has diminished. Teachers find that students are more engaged and can better pace their lesson to suit students’ learning needs. Parents have been very supportive of Subject Based Banding."
review on number of open visits for inmates with children,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) for each year in the past five years, what is the average number of open visits which an inmate has with their childrens; and (b) whether there are plans to increase the number of open visits which an inmate can have with their children.","Mr K Shanmugam: In the past five years, an average of around 1,500 inmates each year participated in structured family programmes which have an open visit component. However, the Singapore Prison Service (SPS) does not track the number of open visits individual inmates have with their children.SPS will extend such programmes to more inmates."
update on new hawker centre in bukit batok,"Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether the Ministry can provide an update on plans to build a new hawker centre in Bukit Batok Town, in particular where will it be built; and (b) what is the expected date of its completion.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: My Ministry announced in 2015 that we would build a new hawker centre in Bukit Batok town by 2027. We will provide further details, such as the location and expected date of completion, when ready."
"value of unpaid salaries in 2016, 2017 and 2018","Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Manpower what was the value of unpaid salaries in 2016, 2017 and 2018 respectively, according to the orders made by the Employment Claims Tribunal on employers to pay owed salaries.","Mrs Josephine Teo: The amount of unpaid salaries ordered by the Employment Claims Tribunals (ECT) since its establishment on 1 April 2017 is shown in the table below. Taking into account that the 2017 figure is not based on the full year, the value of unpaid salaries ordered by the ECT in 2018 is not significantly different from that in 2017. "
plans to encourage take-up of third-party liability insurance among pmd users,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether there are plans to encourage the take-up of third-party liability insurance among PMD users; and (b) whether the Ministry has engaged with the insurance industry to explore this.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The Land Transport Authority (LTA) has been actively promoting the take-up of third-party liability insurance. First, LTA and the Active Mobility Advisory Panel have engaged the insurance industry and posted information on the types of third party liability insurance products available in the market today on LTA's website www.onemotoring.com.sg/escooter. Second, LTA has reached out to e-scooter owners who have registered their devices under the registration regime which commenced on 2 January 2019 to encourage them to purchase third-party liability insurance. LTA has also engaged employers of large groups of active mobility users such as food delivery companies to encourage them to provide insurance coverage. We are currently in the midst of the first license application cycle for motorised personal mobility device (PMD)-sharing services. Operators that are awarded licences to operate will be required to procure and maintain third-party liability insurance.  "
"study on increase of vehicular traffic from e-commerce and food deliveries and its implications on roads, road usage and government's plans","Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the Ministry has carried out studies to determine the extent of the increase of all types of vehicular traffic arising from e-commerce and food deliveries in the past three years and its implications on our roads, road usage and the Government's plans; (b) if yes, whether the Government can share its findings with the public; and (c) if no, whether the Government will consider doing such a study.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: LTA monitors vehicular traffic on our roads on an on-going basis. Over the past few years, congestion levels have remained stable. LTA does not track vehicular traffic arising specifically from e-commerce and food deliveries. We have no plans to require such data from businesses so as not to impose additional regulatory burden on them."
number of drivers aged between 18 and 21 and probationary drivers arrested for drink driving in past five years,"Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Home Affairs over the past five years, how many drivers between the age of 18 and 21 as well as probationary drivers have been arrested for the offence of drink driving.","Mr K Shanmugam: Between 2014 and 2018, on average, about 17 motorists between the ages of 18 and 21 were arrested for drink-driving annually. The corresponding figure for motorists with probationary licences was about 111. The table below provides the detailed statistics. "
usage rate in past five years of automatic external defibrilators installed in public places,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Health in each year of the past five years, what has been the usage rate of Automatic External Defibrilators (AEDs) installed in public places.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Automatic External Defibrillators (AEDs) are used to restart the heart when persons collapse due to cardiac arrest. AED use is associated with increased survival in Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) patients. The latest available data is up to 2017, and indicates that AED usage rate has increased from 1.9% in 2012 to 6.4% in 20171. This increase is likely due to a growing public awareness about the use of AEDs as well as the availability of AEDs in public places. "
"mean kilometres between failure for n-s, e-w, circle, n-e and downtown lines for 2018","Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Transport for 2018, what is the Mean Kilometres Between Failure (MKBF) for (i) the North-South Line (ii) the East-West Line (iii) the Circle Line (iv) North-East Line and (v) the Downtown Line respectively.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The Mean Kilometres Between Failure (MKBF) for the MRT network increased from 181,000 train-km in 2017 to 690,000 train-km in 2018. The 2018 MKBF performance for each of the rail lines is in the Table below. "
measures to protect soldiers and students from falling victim to skin cancer from exposure to ultraviolet light,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Health in light of more skin cancer patients under the age of 50 (a) what is being done to protect soldiers and students exposed to long hours under the sun; and (b) whether there are studies done to monitor these groups of persons as they advance to their 30s and 40s and who may fall victim to skin cancer because of their exposure to ultraviolet light.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Skin cancer was the 9th most common cancer among Singaporeans from 2013-2017. 10% of cases were below 50 years old, although the incidence of new cases in this group increased from 1.2 to 2.7 per 100,000 persons from 1983-1987 to 2013-2017 respectively. Studies have linked cumulative exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light with an increased risk of skin cancer. However, exposure to sunlight has health benefits as it is important for Vitamin D formation and hence for healthy bone formation. Sufficient time outdoors can also help prevent or delay myopia in children. Singapore Armed Forces soldiers are provided with Personal Protective Equipment, such as head gear and long-sleeved combat uniform, that protects them from sun exposure. Physical training conducted in sports attire and swimming kit are typically conducted in the early mornings or late afternoons when sunlight is less intense.  Likewise, in Ministry of Education schools, outdoors activities are generally conducted in the early mornings and late afternoons to minimise students' exposure to UV light. Frequent rest and water breaks under shade are incorporated into activities carried out during other parts of the day. Students are also taught to use sunscreen, broad-brimmed hats and caps, long sleeved shirts, and sunglasses to protect themselves against excessive UV exposure. There are no known local studies regarding skin cancer among young persons as the incidence of skin cancer remains low in this group. Nevertheless, it is prudent that Singaporeans take measures to protect themselves from prolonged exposure to UV light and see a doctor early if they develop symptoms."
number of cases against home-based salons providing dental services in past three years,"Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Health (a) in the past three years, what is the number of cases of home-based salons providing dental services such as dental veneers and teeth whitening; (b) what actions have been taken against these offenders; and (c) whether there are any plans to educate the public against going to such home-based salons for dental services.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: The provision of dental services, such as veneers and teeth whitening services is a practice of dentistry. Under the Dental Registration Act, only a registered dentist is allowed to practice dentistry in Singapore. The practice must be conducted in a premise licensed under the Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act. In the past three years, there were five reported cases on home-based dental services. Investigations into these cases are on-going. The Ministry takes a serious view of the practice of dentistry being performed by non-dentists in unlicensed premises and will not hesitate to take tough enforcement action against any person who contravenes the law. It is unlawful for any person not registered with the Singapore Dental Council to provide dental services. If found guilty, the person shall be liable to a fine not exceeding $25,000. Repeat offenders can be fined up to $50,000 or to an imprisonment for up to six months or to both. Additionally, any person found operating an unlicensed premise shall be liable to a fine not exceeding $20,000 or to a jail term not more than two years or to both.The Ministry advises the public to be cautious about using healthcare services from unfamiliar sources. When in doubt, they should seek advice from their regular doctor or dentist or can check the list of licensed healthcare institutions and registered healthcare professionals on MOH's and relevant professional board's websites. The Ministry will step up our efforts on consumer education regarding unlawful dental services."
complaints of speeding vehicles at night at upper bukit timah road along stretch outside springdale and southaven i & ii condominiums,"Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) in 2017 and 2018, how many complaints have been received about speeding vehicles at Upper Bukit Timah Road particularly at night along the stretch outside Springdale and Southaven (I & II) condominiums; (b) how many accidents have occurred at this stretch of the road; (c) what enforcement action or preventive effort has been made to reduce speeding at this stretch of the road; and (d) whether speed cameras will be installed to reduce the instances of driving above the speed limit.","Mr K Shanmugam: Between 2017 and 2018, there were 14 calls and letters from members of the public to Traffic Police (""TP"") on speeding vehicles along Upper Bukit Timah Road, of which eight cases took place at night. In all 14 cases, the stretch of road outside the two condominiums was not cited. There were, however, 15 road traffic accidents on this stretch of road during the same period. Speeding was likely to have been the cause for only one of the accidents. Eight of the accidents involved vehicles that had been making right turns or U-turns. To help motorists make right turns and U-turns more safely, LTA will install red-amber-green arrow lights at some traffic junctions along Upper Bukit Timah Road, including the stretch of road outside the two condominiums, by the end of this year. To deter speeding and other offences, TP will continue to conduct regular enforcement operations in the area. Prominent signage has been installed outside Springdale Condominium, to remind motorists of the speed limit. TP will also consider installing speed cameras in the area if found necessary.    "
regulations governing online sale of teeth whitening products,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Health whether the teeth whitening products sold online are safe for use and whether there are any regulations governing the online sale of these products.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Teeth whitening products are regulated as cosmetic products under the Health Products (Cosmetic Products – ASEAN Cosmetic Directive) Regulations. They usually contain hydrogen peroxide, a bleaching agent, which may pose a risk of damage to the teeth and gums if used inappropriately.  To safeguard the public, only those preparations containing 0.1% of hydrogen peroxide or less are allowed to be sold directly to consumers. Those containing more than 0.1% can only be supplied or used by registered dentists. The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) monitors the safety of health products, including cosmetics, sold in the local market. HSA conducts regular checks on the products, including those sold online. Sellers of unsafe products will be ordered to remove such products from the market. When online sale of unsafe cosmetic products are detected, HSA will work with the administrators of online platforms to remove the listings of the affected products. Any person found to contravene the regulation is liable to a fine up to $50,000 or imprisonment up to two years, or both.  Given the widespread reach of the internet, consumers play an important part in safeguarding their own health. They should be careful not to purchase these products from unknown vendors and should obtain them from a reliable supplier. For those products containing >0.1% hydrogen peroxide, they should obtain them from a dentist.  "
theft of bicycles in last three years,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is the number of bicycle thefts in the last three years; (b) to date, how many bicycle owners have signed up to join the Bicycle Security Label initiative that was implemented in 2011 to tackle bicycle thefts; and (c) whether the Bicycle Security Label is still issued by the police as part of its theft prevention initiative and, if not, why has it been discontinued.","Mr K Shanmugam: The number of reported bicycle thefts has been on a downward trend in the past three years. In 2018, there were 522 cases, compared to 979 in 2016, and around 1,100-1,200 each year between 2011-2015.The Bicycle Security Label scheme was started in 2011. About 150,000 labels were issued, before the scheme was discontinued in 2017.Police found that the scheme had limited effectiveness in tackling bicycle thefts. For one thing, it was not difficult to tamper with the labels. There are more effective ways to solve bicycle theft cases, such as through the use of CCTV footages to identify the culprits.Police have channelled resources to raise public awareness on preventing bicycle thefts, especially on the use of secure bicycle locks. Police have also worked with LTA and shopping malls to install CCTVs covering designated bicycle parking areas. The expansion of PolCam has also helped to deter and solve theft cases. With these efforts, the number of bicycle theft cases has fallen significantly, by over 57% since 2015."
top three reasons for continuing increase in medifund utilisation,Prof Fatimah Lateef asked the Minister for Health what are the top three reasons for the continuing increase in MediFund utilisation apart from an ageing population.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: MediFund utilisation has increased over the last decade, to $150 million in FY17. The increase was higher in the earlier years. Since FY16, the figure has been more stable, following the introduction of MediShield Life and Pioneer Generation package, both of which extended more healthcare financing support.There are a few reasons for the increase in MediFund utilisation over the past decade: First, we have been helping more Singaporeans, as we expanded our public healthcare capacity to serve more patients. Over the last decade, the number of MediFund applications increased by close to 10% annually, on average.Second, we have expanded the scope of coverage of MediFund to cover more services and conditions. For example, MediFund was extended to cover non-residential intermediate and long term care services in 2012, and to polyclinics, dental services, antenatal and delivery services in 2013.Third, we have been providing greater support to those with greater healthcare needs. For example, we have enhanced the scheme through the introduction of MediFund Silver in 2007 and MediFund Junior in 2013 to better target support for young and elderly Singaporeans respectively.We will continue to monitor the MediFund utilisation to ensure that it is sustainable and no Singaporean is denied appropriate healthcare due to an inability to pay."
"breakdown of phd students, academic and non-faculty research and teaching staff in autonomous universities","Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Education what is the breakdown of the number of local and foreign academics, PhD students, non-faculty research staff and non-faculty teaching staff in our autonomous universities by age group, academic discipline and academic rank/position respectively.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: The breakdown of staff in the Autonomous Universities (AUs) – by academics, non-faculty research staff and non-faculty teaching staff (that is, adjunct lecturers or associate lecturers), and the proportion of Singaporean Citizens (SCs) in each category is in Table 1, PhD students are not AU staff and take on a range of jobs outside the university after graduation.For academics and non-faculty teaching staff, the median ages are around 50. The SC proportions among those who were below 50 years old, and those 50 years and above, are in Table 2. It is not meaningful to compare the SC proportion by age band for researchers, as the overwhelming majority of them are below age 50. SC academics accounted for 50% in Science, Technology, Engineering and Medicine (STEM) disciplines and 48% in Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) disciplines. The proportion of SCs in SSH disciplines was higher than that of STEM for non-faculty researchers and non-faculty teaching staff. The details are in Table 3.Of the academics who were holding senior positions of Associate Professors and above, SCs made up 50%."
impact of no-deal brexit on singapore and effect of brexit on eu-singapore free trade agreement,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) how will Singapore be impacted by a no-deal Brexit; and (b) how will Brexit affect the rectification and implementation of the EU-Singapore Free Trade Agreement.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: The UK is the second largest economy in the EU and the fifth largest globally. It is also an important economic partner of Singapore. Like other countries, we are keeping a close watch on Brexit, which remains set for 29 March 2019. There are three possible scenarios. First, the UK and the EU agreeing on a Withdrawal Agreement. Second, the UK exits the EU without any deal, that is, ""Hard Brexit"". Third, a scenario in which the UK's formal departure from the EU is postponed beyond 29 March 2019. Under the first scenario, the Withdrawal Agreement will include an ""Implementation Period"" that will last till 31 December 2020. This scenario offers the greatest predictability and stability while minimising disruption to businesses. This is because during the Implementation Period, the UK will continue to be functionally treated as an EU Member State, and remain a party to EU international agreements – including the EU-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (EUSFTA) when it is ratified by the European Parliament as targeted in 2019. Under the second no-deal scenario, the UK will cease to be a party to the EU's agreements with third countries when it formally leaves the EU on 29 March 2019. This would mean that the EUSFTA will not apply between the UK and Singapore even after its entry into force. This in itself would not impact our trading relationship with the UK as the current tariff and non-tariff regime for Singapore companies trading with the UK are based on WTO terms which would continue to apply. Under the third scenario, the UK's formal departure from the EU will be postponed to a date after 29 March 2019. This would entail the UK extending the Article 50 timeline, subject to the unanimous approval of all EU Member States. The prospect of an imminent no-deal Brexit would be diminished, although we may see a period of continued uncertainty. Singapore and the UK share substantial trade and investment linkages, with many of our businesses operating in each other's markets across sectors such as pharmaceuticals, professional services and consumer goods. MTI's assessment is that trade between the UK and Singapore will not be fundamentally impaired. Nonetheless, owing to the integrated nature of today's global supply chains as well as the extensive trade linkages that spans the UK, EU, and the rest of the world, a no-deal Brexit could weigh on consumer and business sentiments in the UK and EU, with potential negative effects on global growth. MTI and Enterprise Singapore will continue working closely with Singapore companies to help with any near term company-specific disruption. This will include facilitating link-ups between companies and the appropriate authorities to work through continuity issues in areas such as labour and talent supply, or delays in shipments that might be routed between the UK and the EU. MTI is also in close contact with UK economic agencies on measures to strengthen our strong trade and investment relations. We have several bilateral platforms with the UK, such as the UK-Singapore Economic and Business Partnership (EBP) and the recently launched UK-Singapore Partnership for the Future (P4F). Singapore is also prepared to work with the UK to apply the EUSFTA in a UK-Singapore context that could form the basis of a future Singapore-UK trade agreement.The ratification of the EUSFTA and EU-Singapore Investment Protection Agreement (EUSIPA) is on track. The ratification process is not affected by Brexit, and both agreements are expected to be voted on by the European Parliament during its next sitting from 11 to 14 February 2019. Pending clarity on post-Brexit arrangements, any consequential amendments to the EUSFTA can be addressed during the implementation phase."
measures to reduce food wastage in singapore,"Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources in light of increasing food waste in Singapore (a) how can we engage community and partners through enhancing internal processes, public education, and partnerships to reduce food wastage; and (b) what more can be done specifically in homes, schools, workplaces and food and beverage establishments where food waste is most common.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: In 2017, about 810,000 tonnes of food waste was generated. Food waste is one of our largest waste streams and has a relatively low recycling rate. It remains one of our priority waste streams this year, the Year Towards Zero Waste, together with e-waste and packaging waste. My Ministry takes a multi-pronged approach to addressing food waste, which includes encouraging food waste reduction, food redistribution, and recycling. Since 2015, NEA has been running a food waste reduction campaign that includes media publicity to raise awareness, and outreach programmes on ways to reduce food wastage in households. Educational materials such as the Food Waste Handy Guide, which has tips to help consumers reduce food waste, are made available online and at community road shows. NEA started the ""Love Your Food @ Schools"" programme in April 2017, which encourages schools to minimise food waste. To help the food and beverage industry reduce food wastage, NEA and the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) launched food waste minimisation guidebooks for food retail establishments, supermarkets, and food manufacturing establishments to provide guidance on reducing food waste across the supply chain. Guidelines on the proper handling and redistribution of unsold or excess food are also incorporated to facilitate food redistribution. To promote food waste recycling, NEA supports companies through its 3R Fund, to implement projects such as the installation of on-site food waste treatment systems. NEA has so far co-funded 21 on-site food waste treatment systems. We also conducted a ""Food Waste, Don't Waste!"" pilot at Tampines Greenlace HDB estate, where residents segregated their food waste and disposed of it in dedicated food waste bins on the ground floor. The food waste was then recycled at Our Tampines Hub to produce fertiliser and non-potable water.This multi-pronged approach has begun to yield results. Food waste recycling has increased from 13% in 2015 to 16% in 2017. Nonetheless, there is much more we can do.As part of our Year Towards Zero Waste efforts, my Ministry will continue to explore measures to better manage food waste in homes, schools, workplaces, and food and beverage establishments. These measures will also be part of our inaugural Zero Waste Masterplan to be launched this year. However, the Government cannot do this alone. This is why we have set aside $2 million this year to fund ground-up projects related to Zero Waste. We will also consult the public and engage non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to seek their views and ideas and co-create initiatives to better manage food waste. "
survellance and actions against less permanent establishments in light of incidents of food poisoning and hygiene issues at food premises,"Prof Fatimah Lateef asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources in light of incidents of food poisoning and hygiene issues at food premises, whether there will be any added surveillance and action to be taken for less permanent establishments such as pop-up food stalls, fun fair stalls selling food, night market food stalls and bazaar food stalls.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The National Environment Agency maintains a strict regime to ensure food safety in temporary food stalls, e.g. pop-up food stalls, fun fair stalls selling food, night market food stalls and bazaar food stalls. First, proper washing facilities, storage with temperature control and covered display showcases for food items must be provided at temporary fair food stalls. Second, NEA restricts extensive food preparation, such as degutting of fish and cutting of raw meat or vegetables in temporary stalls. The sale of high-risk food items such as ready-to-eat raw seafood is also restricted Third, food handlers working in such stalls must be registered with NEA and pass the mandatory Basic Food Hygiene Course. NEA will take firm enforcement action against anyone who violates the regulations. Offenders may face licence suspension and/or a maximum penalty of up to $10,000 for the first offence.To uphold the food hygiene standards, NEA conducts unannounced inspections at the temporary food stalls. Where NEA assesses any potential risks, NEA will step up inspections as well as conduct joint operations with other agencies to curb illegal food handlers at the temporary food stalls.NEA will continue to monitor the situation closely and step up inspections, if need be, to safeguard the environment and ensure public health."
students in schools and institutes of higher learning seeking help from counsellors for stress and anxiety,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Education (a) in 2018, what is the total number of students in schools and institutes of higher learning who sought help with counsellors due to stress and anxiety; and (b) what is the current student-counsellor ratio in each school.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: Counselling issues vary in causes and complexity, and schools and Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) have varying ways of tracking them. We estimate that in 2018, around 10 out of every 1,000 students at schools and IHLs received counselling support for anxiety or stress-related issues. These issues include relationship, personal struggles, family disputes, or academic difficulties. We do not have macro level specific breakdown for anxiety or stress-related counselling issues. Today, all schools are resourced with at least one to two school counsellors, while all IHLs are resourced with at least two to three counsellors. They are in turn augmented by part-time MOE-trained school counsellors, para-counsellors, Flexi-Adjunct School Counsellors, or Teacher Counsellors.  MOE is looking into upstream work such as training of teachers in mental health literacy and preventive programmes for vulnerable/at-risk students. All teachers are already equipped with basic counselling skills and serve as front-liners in supporting students with social-emotional needs. Mental health is an issue to be taken seriously, and requires the concerted efforts of educators, counsellors, parents and peers."
unusual divergence in price trends for private homes and hdb resale flats in 2018,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether the unusual divergence in price trends for private homes and HDB resale flats in 2018 is caused by concerns regarding leasehold decay and depreciation of ageing HDB flats; and (b) whether the divergence is a cause for concern if it is not arrested.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The URA's Property Price Index (PPI) captures all private housing transactions, including new sales (units sold by developers), resales and sub-sales; the HDB's Resale Price Index (RPI) captures all HDB resale flat transactions. Insofar as there are underlying factors that affect both the public and private property markets, the two indices would tend to move together. But there have been instances of divergence in the PPI and RPI price trends. This has happened in the past, and more recently between 2Q2017 and 3Q2018. The recent divergence was largely due to euphoric sentiments in the private property market. This resulted in a sharp increase in private property prices over a very short duration. This was not sustainable as prices were increasing well ahead of fundamentals. Hence the government had moved to introduce the last round of cooling measures in July last year.  The Government will continue to monitor both the public and private property markets, and ensure they are stable and sustainable. "
unannounced checks on food service operators and caterers for food safety and hygiene in past five years,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources in the past five years, what proportion of food safety and hygiene checks performed on food service operators and caterers have been unannounced checks.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The National Environment Agency (NEA) currently licenses more than 39,000 retail food establishments, including food outlets such as restaurants and caterers, to ensure that the food sold is prepared hygienically and safe for consumption. All inspections of retail food establishments conducted by NEA are unannounced. In the past five years, NEA has conducted more than 606,000 inspections in total.NEA will take strict enforcement action against retail food establishments that do not adopt proper food hygiene practices, as well as for any food hygiene lapses found. NEA will continue to monitor the situation closely and step up inspections, if need be, to safeguard food safety and public health."
renewal of completely utilised active sg credits,"Prof Fatimah Lateef asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) whether there will be a renewal of the Active SG credits once these have been completely utilised; and (b) if so, whether there will be changes in the terms and conditions of use.","Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien:  In conjunction with the launch of ActiveSG in April 2014, Sport Singapore introduced a one-off $100 credit to ActiveSG members upon joining. The purpose is to encourage Singaporeans to kick-start an active lifestyle.  Currently, we have no plans to renew the credits for members who have utilised them fully, but we are regularly looking for ways to encourage Singaporeans to adopt a more active lifestyle.   "
"students entering normal (technical), normal (academic) and express streams in each of past five years","Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Education for each year in the past five years, what is the number of students entering the (i) Normal (Technical) (ii) Normal (Academic) and (ii) Express streams respectively.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: Over the last five years, about 5,000 students enter the Normal (Technical) course, 10,000 students enter the Normal (Academic) course and 25,500 students enter the Express course each year. The proportion of students entering each course varies slightly each year depending on student performance at the PSLE as well as choice of course made by the students who are eligible for both courses, for example, Express/Normal (Academic).  "
need for increased manpower in social service offices,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Social and Family Development whether the Ministry will consider increasing the manpower in social service offices as they take on the enhanced role of coordinating with all the community organisations to provide holistic help to families and individuals in distress.,"Mr Desmond Lee: The Ministry of Social and Family Development's (MSF) Social Service Offices (SSOs) carry out two main functions. First, the SSOs deliver financial assistance to low-income individuals and families, and link them up to various agencies for their other needs, such as housing, employment and family services. The objective is to ensure that these individuals or families receive comprehensive help. For example, where there are families with complex needs that require interfaces with multiple agencies, SSOs can step in to facilitate discussions or convene case conferences where needed. Second, the SSOs do ground sensing and local services planning, working closely with community partners to coordinate the planning and delivery of social services in the community. The demands on our SSOs are growing. Over the years, the number of ComCare applications has increased, in large part because of increased awareness of available help schemes with the rollout of the network of 24 SSOs. Our SSOs are located within HDB towns, so that those in need can access help easily. The number of complex cases requiring coordination by the SSOs has also grown. To respond to these challenges amid tighter manpower constraints, MSF is taking a multi-pronged approach. First, we are leveraging technology like video-conferencing to enhance productivity and efficiency at the SSOs. Second, we are strengthening backend inter-agency coordination, supported by enhanced protocols, data-sharing, and town-level SG Community Networks sessions. Third, we are using data analytics to inform resource planning and optimise deployment across our SSOs. These strategies ensure that our SSOs work efficiently yet effectively to serve vulnerable individuals and families. MSF periodically reviews the SSOs' manpower needs, and will continue to monitor our operations, and adjust the level of required resourcing accordingly. Even as the SSOs step up to pull together efforts to help vulnerable families, we also appreciate the active contributions by the community and every Singaporean to this collective effort of giving those in need a leg up to regain stability, and building a caring society."
study on greater flexibility for monthly cpf payouts,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether the Ministry has studied allowing greater flexibility for eligible CPF members in choosing monthly payout amounts, such as deferring a portion of their monthly payout, to allow members to tailor CPF payouts to their changing incomes and expenditures as they age; (b) if so, what are the results of such studies; and (c) what are the policy considerations involved in allowing such greater flexibility.","Mrs Josephine Teo: We recognise that CPF members have varying needs in retirement. This is why we have provided members with a number of options to have flexibility in their CPF retirement payouts. At age 55, CPF members are required to set aside savings up to their cohort Full Retirement Sum (FRS) in the Retirement Account (RA). Members with sufficient property charge or pledge can also choose to set aside the Basic Retirement Sum (BRS) instead. Members will then receive a steady stream of monthly payouts in retirement depending on the amount they have in their RAs. Members can consider the following options if they wish to receive higher payouts:(a) Set aside a higher amount in their RA, up to the prevailing Enhanced Retirement Sum (ERS). This can be done by topping up their RA in cash, or transferring CPF savings from their own Ordinary or Special Accounts or from their family member's CPF accounts to their RA.(b) Start payouts later. Deferring the start of payouts will increase their payout quantum, duration or both. Members can also choose the CPF LIFE Escalating Plan that provides lower payouts at first and subsequently higher payouts that increase at 2% every year.  Beyond these options, members can also further adjust their payouts through CPF transfers and cash top-ups, even after they have started their payouts. Overall, we have to carefully balance providing members with flexibility to meet their diverse needs with the need to keep the CPF system adequate and simple. CPF members can approach CPF Board to better understand how the different payout options can meet their needs."
status of social enterprises in 2018,"Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what is the total number of social enterprises (SEs) last year; (b) how many of these SEs are registering revenues of more than $150,000; (c) how many SEs are more than three years old; and (d) what has been the impact of SEs on the social sector in the same period.","Mr Desmond Lee: The Singapore Centre for Social Enterprise, or raiSE, is the membership body and sector developer for social enterprises (SEs) in Singapore. Funded by MSF, Tote Board and the National Council of Social Service (NCSS), raiSE had a membership of 336 SE members as at 31 March 2018. Of these, 92 (27%) had an annual revenue of at least or more than $200,0001.148 members (44%) were registered or incorporated in 2015 or earlier. SEs are not required to register with raiSE, and not all SEs are members of raiSE.SEs aim to provide business solutions to address social needs and gaps, creating social impact in sustainable ways. In this way, SEs bridge the gap between conventional charities and for-profit companies. SEs create social impact in many ways, such as through developing innovative solutions to emerging social needs and providing consultancy services to the social service sector. One significant area of impact is in the provision of employment opportunities for disadvantaged and needy beneficiaries. In Financial Year 2017, 869 such beneficiaries were employed by 120 raiSE members."
cpf withdrawal limit for housing mortgages,"Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for Manpower as of January 2019 (a) what is the number of members who have reached their CPF Withdrawal Limit for their properties and are using other means to service their housing mortgages; (b) what is the number of CPF members who appealed to use their Special and/or Retirement Accounts to help service their properties and of this number, how many have been given approval to do so.","Mrs Josephine Teo: (a) Number of CPF members who have reached their withdrawal limits  Currently, about 740,000 property owners use their CPF savings to service their housing instalments. Of these, about 6,000 (0.8%) property owners have reached their withdrawal limits for housing and are using other means to finance their mortgage. They include members who have reached the Valuation Limit (VL) but cannot use more of their CPF savings for housing as they do not have at least the Basic Retirement Sum (BRS), or members who took bank loans and have reached the Withdrawal Limit (WL) cap set at 120% VL. (b) Number of CPF members who appeal to use Special and/or Retirement Account savings The Special Account (SA) and Retirement Account (RA) savings are safeguarded for members' retirement needs, and generally cannot be used for housing purposes.  That said, CPF Board exercised flexibility in some cases. For example, CPF Board has allowed CPF members to use their RA savings that originated from their Ordinary Account (OA) to pay for their housing on appeal, even if their RA savings are below the BRS. In 2018, CPF Board granted about 8,000 appeals to use their RA savings for housing. The Board took into account the member's retirement adequacy and outstanding loan amount in deciding whether an exception could be made."
working mothers receiving childcare subsidies,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) whether working mothers who have been receiving childcare subsidies can continue to receive the same level of subsidies for up to three months without being subjected to a case-by-case review when they become unemployed and are looking for a new job in the interim; and (b) under what circumstances do current case-by-case reviews reject such appeals.,"Mr Desmond Lee: Working mothers who become unemployed may need some time to look for a new job. The Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) supports these mothers by providing the same level of child care subsidies for three months after their employment had ended This extension of subsidies is intended to support these mothers and give them peace of mind as they look for employment, knowing that their children continue to be cared for in preschool. We will continue to review these policies and processes, as providing affordable and quality preschool services for parents is a key priority for the Government. "
cpf withdrawals for annual premiums of endowment policies going back to cpf upon maturity,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Minister for Manpower whether the CPF Board can allow withdrawals after an account holder reaches 55 years of age for their payment of annual premiums of endowment policies which will go back to CPF upon maturity.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: Endowment policies with regular premium payments were available for sale under the CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS) before 2001. CPF members age 55 and above who had purchased such policies can continue to pay for their premiums using their savings in the Ordinary Account after setting aside their cohort Full Retirement Sum, or Basic Retirement Sum if they have a sufficient property charge or pledge. For members who have not set aside the required Retirement Sum, CPF Board will consider allowing them to use their CPF savings to pay the endowment policy premiums on a case by case basis."
training and supervision standards for private security companies,"Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether there are requirements for private security companies to adequately train, supervise and ensure that private security officers uphold the standards required in the discharge of their duties and responsibilities; (b) what are the penalties for private security companies who fail to adhere to these requirements; and (c) whether penalties should be imposed on private security companies whose private security officers are errant or delinquent in the discharge of their duties.","Mr K Shanmugam: Security agencies are responsible for the training and performance of their security officers.They must ensure that their security officers are trained in accordance with the requirements under the Progressive Wage Model (PWM) for the security industry. In fact, PWM requirements are part of the licensing conditions for security agencies. Failure to comply would constitute a breach of the licensing conditions, which is an offence punishable with a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or to both.Security agencies are also required to undergo the annual Security Agencies Grading Exercise (SAGE). The assessment includes whether their security officers are adequately trained and knowledgeable about relevant security processes. Regulatory offences committed by a security agency will also affect their SAGE score. Those that fare poorly in SAGE will be given a D (unsatisfactory) grade, and if they receive two consecutive D grades, their licences will not be renewed. Security agencies can also be taken to task if they are found to have contributed to their officer's offence or errant behaviour."
foreigner on long term visit pass applying for private hire car vocational licence,"Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Transport under what circumstances will a foreigner on a long term visit pass with a Letter of Consent issued by the Ministry of Manpower that allows him to be employed as a driver in a private company be permitted to apply for a Private Hire Car Vocational Licence despite the fact that he will not be able to fulfill LTA's requirement that he must have a work pass issued by the Ministry of Manpower with his vocation stated as ""chauffeur"".",Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The Land Transport Authority (LTA) does not allow Letter of Consent (LOC) holders to obtain a Private Hire Car Driver's Vocational Licence (PDVL).
progress of nominating singapore's hawker culture for unesco's representative list of intangible culture heritage of humanity,"Mr Ang Wei Neng asked ask the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) what is the progress of nominating Singapore's Hawker Culture for UNESCO's Representative List of the Intangible Culture Heritage of Humanity; (b) how many Singaporeans have pledged their support pertaining to the nomination; and (c) what more can Singaporeans do to lend support to the nomination.","Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced that we will nominate our hawker culture for inscription on the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) of Humanity during his 2018 National Day Rally speech. Our hawker culture is a total cultural experience of the place, the food, and the people, that binds us together as Singaporeans. It is an integral part of our daily lives, our collective experience, and our national identity.  The National Heritage Board (NHB) is putting together the materials for Singapore's bid, which will be submitted to UNESCO in March 2019.  A 14-member nomination committee, with representatives from the public, private, and people sectors, was also established in September 2018 to guide our efforts to secure a successful inscription. This committee will continue its work until the result of the nomination is known in late 2020.  Support from the community will be crucial for us to secure a successful inscription. The NHB, National Environment Agency (NEA) and Federation of Merchants' Association, Singapore (FMAS) have been raising awareness and gathering support from Singaporeans and the wider society for the nomination.  The nomination has received widespread support from Singaporeans from all walks of life. As of 7 January 2019, there have been almost 220,000 pledges of support for the nomination made online, through our travelling exhibition, and at pledging stations at hawker centres, public events, schools, libraries, museums, and other public spaces. In addition, more than 8,000 pledge cards have been collected where Singaporeans expressed why hawker culture is so important to them. The community – including schools, businesses, and other groups and organisations – has also stepped forward to support the nomination. For example, students from the Singapore Management University, Temasek Polytechnic, Republic Polytechnic, Pei Chun Public School and First Toa Payoh Primary School, among others, have submitted letters of support, initiated student projects to increase appreciation of our hawker culture, and volunteered their time to engage Singaporeans at the traveling exhibition. The Singapore Business Federation, Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Community Development Councils and the Eurasian Association, have also pledged support for the nomination. Our hawker associations and FMAS have also submitted letters of support. "
objections to performance of rupauls' drag race show in singapore,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) whether the Ministry has received objections to the performance of the RuPauls' Drag Race show in Singapore; (b) what are the criteria for approving such performances; (c) how does the Ministry deal with approval and censorship of performances dealing with LGBT issues; and (d) how is the age restriction for the audience determined for such shows.,"Mr S Iswaran: The Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) administers the regulatory regime for Arts Entertainment (AE) which include plays, variety shows, and art exhibitions. In assessing and classifying an AE, IMDA is guided by the Arts Entertainment Classification Code (AECC) which sets out the classification system and the principles of classification. The AECC was developed in consultation with the community and aims to reflect prevailing social norms, protect the young from unsuitable content while enabling adults to make informed viewing choices. There are four classification ratings for AE: (i) General; (ii) Advisory; (iii) Advisory 16; and (iv) Restricted 18 (R18). An AE rated R18 is age restricted and can only be viewed by those aged 18 and above. In determining an appropriate rating for an AE, IMDA takes into consideration the overall theme, the content elements, message and impact of the work and its suitability for the different age groups. An AE which deals with a more mature theme or content including LGBT content, would be given a higher classification rating. Content that goes beyond the R18 rating will not be allowed. For an AE rated higher than ""General"", IMDA will issue a consumer advice to highlight content elements within the AE to enable the public to make an informed decision, as well as guide parents on the suitability of the AE for their children. The rating and consumer advice issued by IMDA for an AE must be reflected in all of its publicity materials and at ticketing booths and event venues. ""RuPaul’s Drag Race"" is a variety show and similar shows have been staged previously in Singapore. Past shows have generally been classified R18 in view of the mature content and have not attracted much feedback. IMDA has received the AE licence application for the RuPaul's Drag Race show to be held in February 2019 and will assess the performance in accordance with the AECC."
culture pass for events to encourage cultural discovery,"Mr Terence Ho Wee San asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth whether the Ministry will consider issuing a ""culture pass"" vis-à-vis a mobile application which offers a credit similar to ActiveSG for students and senior citizens to spend on cultural events and encourage cultural discovery.","Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: The Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY), National Arts Council (NAC) and National Heritage Board (NHB) recognise that culture adds to Singapore's vibrancy and liveability, helps to connect communities with one another, and roots us as Singaporeans. Our arts and culture play a critical role in fostering caring citizens, a cohesive society, and a confident nation.  Since 2013, all Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents have been given free admission to the ten national museums and heritage institutions.1 More people have visited our institutions, with visitorship numbers reaching an all-time high of 5.1 million in 2016.2  Throughout the year, NAC, NHB, the People's Association (PA), and our cultural institutions such as the Esplanade organise free arts and culture events. These include popular events like our annual Singapore Art Week, Singapore Heritage Festival, PAssionArts Festival and Singapore Night Festival. Singaporeans were able to enjoy over 6,000 of such non-ticketed performances in 2016.3 We also partner organisations such as the National Library Board and PA to bring quality arts and heritage programmes directly to the neighbourhood libraries, community clubs, and other community spaces.   We thank Mr Ho, and will consider his suggestion of a ""culture pass"" mobile application as part of our ongoing efforts in our SG Arts and SG Heritage Plans to grow audiences and enhance our outreach efforts by leveraging technology. "
supplementary retirement scheme,"Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Finance with regard to the Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) for each of the last five years (a) what is the number of contributors, by marginal income tax rate of assessable income (i.e. pre-SRS contribution); (b) what are the amounts contributed, by marginal income tax rate of assessable income; and (c) whether the Ministry has studied the elasticity and determinants of SRS contribution behaviours and the results of such studies.","Mr Heng Swee Keat: The Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) was introduced in 2001 as a tax-incentivised scheme to encourage individuals to save voluntarily for retirement, beyond the basic provisions of the CPF. Taken together, the CPF and SRS comprise our system of mandatory and voluntary contributions to help people save for retirement.Each year, MOF publishes the total number of SRS account holders and total SRS contributions. These statistics, dating back to the scheme's inception in 2001, are available on the MOF website. In a given year, about 60% of the account holders contribute to their account.90% of those who made an SRS contribution in the past year have an Assessable Income of more than $80,000, which corresponds to an average marginal tax rate of about 15.0%. In this group, the average contribution in a year has been around $14,000. The remaining 10% who contributed in the past year have an Assessable Income of below $80,000. The average contribution in a year has been around $9,000. Their average marginal tax rate is about 3.2%. This contribution pattern has been fairly stable over the past five years.The details of elasticity and determinants of SRS contribution behaviour are complex. Possible factors include awareness of the scheme, income levels, and personal willingness to set aside more for retirement. Nevertheless, the government will continue to study this matter, together with academics and researchers, to better understand how Singaporeans think about financial planning for retirement.  "
study of public preferences for government expenditure,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for Finance whether the Ministry will study public preferences for Government expenditure by requesting income tax filers to hypothetically earmark 10% of their income taxes towards the expenditure of a particular Ministry and making public the results of such studies to strengthen Government accountability and responsiveness.,"Mr Heng Swee Keat: Understanding the public's needs and preferences is a central part of the Ministry of Finance's work so that we can better allocate public spending to serve the nation's needs. We do so through various methods, including surveys, various feedback channels and direct engagements with citizens.Every year, the Government holds a formal Budget feedback exercise to understand citizens' concerns as part of preparations for the annual Budget. For Budget 2019, REACH had Listening Points across Singapore from 3 December 2018 to 11 January 2019 to provide accessible, open booths for Singaporeans to give their views for Budget 2019. Feedback received during these consultations contribute to the formulation of the Budget and prioritisation of Government expenditures.For example, the increase in social spending in recent years reflects our collective aspirations to better care for one another and to do more for the vulnerable members of our society. At the same time, the Government must also devote appropriate resources to areas serving the collective good, like defence, law and order, and public infrastructure.We will continue to explore different ways to understand public preferences, and help the public better understand the link between government revenue and expenditure."
need for white-collar and cybercrime investigators in singapore police force,Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether there is a need to increase the number of white-collar and cybercrime investigators employed by the Singapore Police Force so that there is a deeper capacity to deal with the heavier workload.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The Singapore Police Force (SPF) is monitoring the commercial and cybercrime workload situation closely, and will make resourcing adjustments whenever necessary.The SPF has also enhanced its capacity and capabilities to deal with such crimes in other ways.First, better organisation of resources. In 2016, cybercrime investigation, digital forensics training, liaison and policy matters were integrated under a single Cybercrime Command. This has allowed SPF to achieve greater economies of scale and better coordination between sub-units in fighting cybercrime.Second, better training of officers. Officers with the aptitude for cybercrime investigations and digital forensics are given specialised training and deployed to the Police Land Divisions. All frontline uniformed Police officers and investigation officers have also been trained in basic cybercrime investigations.Third, the use of technology, such as digital forensics, malware analysis, and video analytics. This has helped to strengthen the SPF's capabilities and reduce the reliance on manpower.Fourth, working more closely with the community in crime prevention. In concert with the National Crime Prevention Council, the Police have launched several rounds of cybercrime and scam prevention education campaigns to raise public awareness and vigilance."
income tax rate of employment pass holders,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Finance whether the Government will consider raising the income tax rate of employment pass holders to provide additional tax revenue to meet the rising social cost.,"Mr Heng Swee Keat: We need to raise revenue to finance our rising spending needs. But we have to do so in a way that ensures our tax system remains fair and internationally competitive.Employment Pass holders make economic contributions to Singapore and pay taxes like Singaporeans. Under our progressive income tax system, those who earn more (including Employment Pass holders) already pay a higher proportion of their income in taxes. Furthermore, under our tax treaties, we are required to not discriminate on the basis of nationality in our income tax treatment. This is in line with the international norms in both the OECD and the United Nations standards for tax treaty provisions.While our income tax treatment does not discriminate on the basis of nationality, our tax reliefs do support various social and economic objectives, especially for those who make Singapore their home. For example, all eligible operationally ready National Servicemen (NSmen) are entitled to NSman tax relief, to recognise their contributions to National Service; and their wives and parents are also granted tax reliefs to recognise the support they give to their husbands and sons. In addition, the revenues we collect are used to benefit mainly Singaporeans. This is why citizens enjoy a range of subsidies and privileges, in areas like education, healthcare and housing, which are not available to Employment Pass holders."
review of electronic game loot boxes as form of gambling,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether electronic game loot boxes are being reviewed as being a form of gambling, as seen in some other jurisdictions.","Mr K Shanmugam: Electronic game loot boxes are virtual items that can be bought using real-world money or in-game credits. These loot boxes yield a range of prizes that can be used in the game (e.g. weapons). The specific prizes in each loot box are determined by chance.The Remote Gambling Act (""RGA"") covers games of chance conducted over remote communications and the internet, which allow players to win money or money’s worth.Given the randomness of the prizes in loot boxes, they are a game of chance. However, whether the loot boxes are considered a form of gambling under the RGA depends on whether there are in-game facilities that allow players to convert game credits or any in-game items (e.g. weapons and skills) to real-world money or merchandises.MHA has been studying different aspects of this matter."
bto flats sold to second-timer buyers in past four years,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked ﻿the Minister for National Development in the past four years, how many BTO flats have been sold to second-timer buyers and how many of these second-timer buyers will be collecting keys to their BTO flats in each of the next three years.","Mr Lawrence Wong: From January 2015 to December 2018, about 13,000 second-timers have booked a BTO flat. About 2,600, 2,600 and 3,400 second-timer buyers will be invited to collect keys to their BTO flats in 2019, 2020 and 2021 respectively. "
breakdown of successful single applicants for 2-room flexi flats by gender and income bracket,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development whether he can provide a breakdown of the number of singles who have successfully applied for 2-room flexi flats since they were launched, by (i) gender and (ii) income bracket, specifically those with a monthly income of $1,000 and less, and between $1,001 and $6,000 in multiples of $1,000.","Mr Lawrence Wong: 2-room Flexi flats were first offered for sale in November 2015. From 1 November 2015 to 31 December 2018, a total of 18,572 singles had applied and were invited to select a 2-room Flexi flat under HDB's Build-To-Order (BTO) and Sale of Balance Flats (SBF) exercises.1 A breakdown of this figure by gender and income is provided in Table 1 below."
efforts to integrate environmental education into education system,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Education (a) what are the current efforts to integrate environmental education into our education system; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider working with environmental groups to create a standardised environmental education package for Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) and Form Teacher Guidance Periods (FTGP).,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: Environmental education is integrated into multiple subjects taught at the various levels. For example, at the primary level, students learn about conservation, and the negative impact of pollution, global warming, and deforestation on the environment and living things in Science. In Social Studies, students learn about Singapore's physical environment and the importance of using resources responsibly. They also apply their knowledge of the 3Rs: Reduce, Reuse and Recycle in their daily lives as ""Environment Champions"". At the secondary level, the Geography, Science and Social Studies syllabi extend students' learning to deeper issues like natural resource depletion, as well as environmental impact of rising global temperature and waste disposal (for example, sewage, toxic chemicals). Students have opportunities to examine and weigh various solutions to achieve environmental sustainability. They also appreciate the inter-dependence of different species in biological ecosystems, understand the importance of conservation and examine the roles of different stakeholders (for example, local communities and business operators) in environmental conservation. Teachers engage students in the learning of these topics through inquiry-based learning, and the use of real-world examples and case studies. Students also participate in excursions and conduct fieldwork, such as at parks and nature reserves, to reinforce their learning. Schools augment the learning in the formal curriculum with a variety of co-curricular activities and learning experiences. For example, many schools have established their own environmental clubs to enable students to do their part for the environment through action. They also participate actively in various environment-themed projects and activities such as the ABC (Active, Beautiful and Clean) Water Trail organised by the Public Utilities Board, the Greenwave environmental competition organised by SembCorp and the Environment Health Institute's workshops on climate change and dengue. Many schools have also been recognised by the Singapore Environment Council with the School Green Awards for the environmental efforts of their students.MOE welcomes inputs from different stakeholders as part of our continuing efforts to enrich our students’ knowledge and learning experiences and will incorporate these in our ongoing curriculum reviews."
statistics on workplace injuries and fatalities and their reporting criteria,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how our rates per 100,000 employed persons in Singapore for (i) minor workplace injury (ii) major workplace injury and (iii) death, compare with other countries who also base their reporting criteria on that of the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA); and (b) what would be the possible factors for the difference if there is a significant discrepancy for those rates.","Mrs Josephine Teo: Both Singapore and the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA) require reporting of injuries that result in more than three days of medical leave. In addition, Singapore also requires reporting of injuries that result in at least 24 hours of hospitalisation.Singapore attained a workplace fatal injury rate of 1.2 per 100,000 employed persons in 2017. This was lower than the average fatal injury rate of 1.7 per 100,000 employed persons among EU countries that use EU-OSHA's reporting criteria.EU-OSHA does not publish minor or major injury data, but does so for non-fatal injuries as a whole. Singapore had a non-fatal injury rate of 368 per 100,000 employed persons in 2017, compared to the EU-OSHA average of 1,586 per 100,000 employed persons. We should, however, be cautious in comparing our non-fatal injury rate with that of the EU. While Singapore and EU-OSHA apply the same threshold of medical leave duration for reporting purposes, differences in data collection systems may account for some variations. EU countries with higher non-fatal injury rates generally draw injury data from insurance claims, while those with lower rates generally rely on injury reporting by employers. "
percentage of normal technical stream students transferred to express stream by end of secondary school education,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Education for each cohort of students in each of the last five years respectively, what is the percentage of students from the Normal Technical stream who have transferred to the Express stream by the end of their Secondary school education.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: Over the last five years, an average of around 530 students (close to 10%) transfer from Normal (Technical) to the Normal (Academic) course. Of these, about 10 to 20 each year eventually transferred to the Express course.  In 2018, after Subject-Based Banding was rolled out to all schools, about 60% of Secondary One Normal (Technical) students offered selected subjects at Normal (Academic) and Express levels, in line with their strengths. Beyond mobility between Secondary school courses, there are also multiple post-secondary pathways to cater to the diverse strengths and talents of our students."
annual number of applications for nric and passport in past five years,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is the annual number of applications for NRIC and passport respectively in the past five years; (b) how many of these applications are online applications; and (c) what are the age profiles of those who have submitted non-online applications.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The annual number of passport applications, the proportion of online applications, and the age profiles of those who submitted non-online applications can be found in Tables 1A and 1B below.NRIC applications are received mainly through the mandatory NRIC registration and re-registration exercises at age 15, 30 and 55, as well as the optional NRIC re-registration exercise for those born before 1 January 1962 that is, those above age 55 as at 1 January 2017). In addition, NRIC applications are also submitted by those who wish to change their NRIC particulars, or to replace their lost or damaged NRICs.For each of the above groups, the annual number of applications, and the proportion of online applications can be found in Table 2 below."
usage of medisave to pay for parents’ healthcare costs in past five years and median withdrawal value,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for Health in each of the past five years (a) what is the number of people using their MediSave to pay for their parents' healthcare cost; and (b) what is the median withdrawal value.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Between 2014 and 2017, about 6% of all MediSave withdrawals were for MediSave account holder's parents' healthcare expenses, which includes inpatient, day surgery and outpatient expenses. The details are in Table 1 below."
"median, average and range of balances left in cpf members' medisave accounts in last five years on their demise","Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Health in the last five years, what have been the median, average and range of balances left in CPF members' MediSave accounts when they passed on.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: MediSave helps Singaporeans set aside part of their income over their working years to save up for healthcare expenses in old age, when their healthcare needs are typically higher. Between 2013 and 2017, about half of Singaporeans aged 65 and above who passed away had about $5,500 or less in their MediSave. For those who pass away at an older age of 85 and older, half had $4,000 or less left in their MediSave Account.The data are summarised in Table 1 below.Some of them have also benefited from the Pioneer Generation Package, which includes annual MediSave top-ups of up to $800 and additional MediShield Life premium subsidies."
"hdb lessees currently servicing hdb loans, fixed-rate bank loans and floating rate bank loans","Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked the Minister for National Development (a) by size of HDB flat, how many HDB lessees are currently servicing (i) HDB loans (ii) fixed-rate bank loans and (iii) floating-rate bank loans; (b) what are the average monthly instalments payable, by size of HDB flat and type of loan, in CPF and cash respectively; and (c) whether the Ministry has studied how sensitive monthly instalments are to the present sustained rise in market interest rates and the results of such studies.","Mr Lawrence Wong: As at 31 December 2018, 490,440 HDB flat owners were servicing mortgages, of which 320,526 (65%) took their loan from HDB. Of these households, 68,715 (~22% of 320,526) owned a 3-room or smaller flat, 147,310 (46%) owned a 4-room flat, 84,281 (26%) owned a 5-room flat and the remaining 20,220 (6%) owned an Executive or bigger flat. The average monthly instalment for flat owners of 3-room and smaller, 4-room, 5-room, and Executive/bigger flats servicing HDB loans was $567, $853, $1,058 and $1,253 respectively. Amongst these flat owners, 224,836 (70% of 320,526) households paid their monthly instalment fully using CPF monies, 44,693 (14%) households paid fully in cash, and 50,997 (16%) households used a combination of cash and CPF monies.   Of the flat owners who took a loan from HDB, the large majority (292,664 or 91%) took a concessionary loan. The interest rate of concessionary HDB loans is pegged at 0.1% above the CPF Ordinary Account interest rate, which is currently at 2.5% and does not change frequently. This has helped to provide certainty to HDB borrowers on their monthly mortgage repayments. At the same time, there were about 169,914 (35% of 490,440) households servicing loans from financial institutions (FIs) for their HDB flats. Of these households, 36,875 (22% of 169,914) owned a 3-room or smaller flat, 73,397 (43%) owned a 4-room flat, 45,381 (27%) owned a 5-room flat, and the remaining 14,261 (8%) owned an Executive or bigger flat. However, as of September 2018, less than one-third of all outstanding housing loans extended by FIs were pegged to floating market interest rates, down from about 60% in 2016. Many FI borrowers have switched to fixed-rate loan packages, which has reduced their vulnerability to market interest rate increases.The government has also put in place measures to encourage financial prudence among borrowers that could help to mitigate the impact of rising market interest rates. For instance, loans for the purchase of HDB flats granted by FIs are subject to a maximum loan amount based on the flat's value and a Mortgage Servicing Ratio (MSR) of 30%, with the latter computed using a medium-term interest rate (currently 3.5%). FIs are also required to provide a Residential Property Loan Fact Sheet when marketing property loans, to help borrowers understand how they will be impacted by higher interest rates.In addition, MAS regularly conducts stress tests on households' mortgage exposures. Most HDB owners' mortgage payments to FIs are expected to remain manageable under a ""severe stress"" scenario of both higher interest rates and lower household incomes."
communique issued at g20 summit in buenos aires on 1 december 2018,"Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for Trade and Industry to what extent the Government agrees with the communique issued at the G20 Summit in Buenos Aires on 1 December 2018, in particular that the multilateral trading system is currently falling short of its objectives and that there is a need for reforms at the World Trade Organisation to improve its functioning.","Mr Chan Chun Sing: Singapore welcomes the G20 Leaders' Declaration in advancing the Argentinean Presidency's theme of ""Building Consensus for Fair and Sustainable Development"", which affirms the G20's commitment to pursuing strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth. We also welcome the G20's pledge to work together to improve a rules-based international order that is capable of effectively responding to a rapidly changing world.The rules-based multilateral trading system has provided predictability and stability in the conduct of international trade, facilitated trade and investment liberalisation, fostered cooperation and interdependence between economies, and underpinned global economic growth for decades.The World Trade Organisation (WTO) has made efforts, since its establishment in 1995, to ensure that its rules and core functions remain relevant for business and governments in the face of rapidly evolving trade realities. With more than 160 WTO Members, obtaining consensus can be challenging. Some notable successes include the conclusion of the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) in 2013 and the expansion of the Information Technology Agreement (ITA2) in 2015, which expedite the flow of goods across borders and further liberalise trade in information and communication technology products respectively. However, the pace of reforms needs to be accelerated.This includes updating WTO rules to support and facilitate the growth of the digital economy. Singapore, together with Australia and Japan, drives the WTO Joint Statement Initiative on E-Commerce (JSI), a widely supported endeavour to develop multilateral trade rules on e-commerce which 72 WTO Members accounting for 77% of global trade have signed up to thus far.The WTO's effective functioning is crucial for Singapore, as a small and open economy heavily dependent on trade. WTO reform discussions are taking place in Geneva, and plurilaterally amongst concerned members. Singapore is supportive of all efforts to build up and strengthen the WTO and will continue to contribute to discussions at the WTO and other fora."
average lifespan of volunteers actively involved in charity work,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) currently, what is the average lifespan of volunteers who were actively involved in charity work when they were alive; and (b) whether there is a co-relation between a person's lifespan and the age he starts volunteering or the years of volunteer service performed.","Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: We do not track the statistic that Mr Gan has asked for. A study by the National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre (NVPC) in 2013 found that a person's perception of well-being is positively correlated with giving, which includes volunteering or donating. Specifically, 66% of givers, as compared to 45% of non-givers, were more likely to report they experience high levels of well-being1. Giving may increase well-being as volunteers derive deep meaning from helping others, are more grateful for their own life situation, and grow a bigger network of positive social relationships, along with a stronger sense of community. A research in Scotland2 in 2018 found that volunteering benefitted the mental and physical well-being of volunteers, with benefits found to be more significant for older volunteers (60 years and above) who are more subject to loneliness, role-identity loss such as loss of employment or loss of partner/departure of children, and ill health."
bca design and installation requirements for manhole covers of utility services in new hdb estates,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for National Development (a) what are the BCA design and installation requirements for manhole covers of utility services in new HDB estates; and (b) whether noise reduction has been factored in for the design and installation of such covers on vehicular driveways with interlocking pavers.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Manhole covers within HDB precincts are generally for water, sewerage and telecommunications purposes, and are hence built in accordance to guidelines by PUB and IMDA. As for manhole covers on public roads, these are built by the Utility Providers in accordance to guidelines by LTA. The various guidelines ensure that manhole covers are structurally sound, and fit for purpose. Covers are intended to fit properly with the manhole and should emit minimal noise as a result.HDB receives minimal feedback related to noise from manhole covers on vehicular driveways with interlocking pavers. In the few instances where there have been noise complaints, they were generally due to poor fit of the cover with the manhole. This can usually be addressed by clearing the manhole of debris, replacing covers which have become warped due to long term exposure to the elements, or grinding the cover to achieve a better fit with the manhole. Where such situations arise in HDB precincts, HDB will work with the Town Councils to rectify them."
requirement to dispose private property within six months of effective date of purchase of non-subsidised or resale flat,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for National Development with regard to the requirement to dispose private property within six months of the effective date of purchasing a non-subsidised or resale flat (a) how many cases of private residential property in Singapore and overseas have been so disposed since the inception of this policy; (b) how many appeals asking for retention of such property have the Ministry received; and (c) how many of such appeals are approved and what is the basis for the approval.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB flats are meant for owner-occupation. To reinforce this principle, buyers of HDB resale flats are not allowed to retain ownership of local or overseas private properties. Since the policy was introduced in August 2010, slightly over 5,000 households have disposed of their private properties when they purchased flats from the resale market. In the last 3 years, about 1,200 households appealed to retain their private property. Of these, HDB acceded to about 300 appeals after considering the specific facts of each case, taking into account factors such as the owner's share in the private property, and the reasons why the private property cannot be recovered for his or her own use."
offer of lift upgrading programme for third time to blocks unsuccessful at polls twice,"Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for National Development whether HDB will consider offering the Lift Upgrading Programme for the third time to those blocks that have been unsuccessful at the polls twice, given that new residents may have moved into the blocks.","Mr Lawrence Wong: The Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP) is offered to HDB blocks without direct lift access and where the cost cap per benefitting unit can be met.  For blocks that have failed the polling once previously, HDB will evaluate appeals for a second poll provided that Advisers can demonstrate that circumstances have changed since the earlier failed poll. This can be through an informal survey and Advisers should receive at least 75% support from residents before appealing for LUP to be re-offered.To ensure that LUP polls are taken seriously, blocks that are offered LUP a second time will be informed that it will be the final round of LUP polling. We should respect the residents' final decision. Re-opening the polls for the third time is likely to lead to negative feedback from residents who had earlier objected to LUP. Nonetheless, we are open to considering requests for a third poll on a case-by-case basis, if there are good reasons. This includes strong resident support of at least 75%."
latest figure for average household expenditure on basic needs,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Trade and Industry what is the latest figure for the Average Household Expenditure on Basic Needs (AHEBN) for all available household sizes by number of persons.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: The Average Household Expenditure on Basic Needs (AHEBN) is an estimate of the average monthly expenditure that households spend on essential needs such as food, clothing and shelter.The AHEBN for a four-person household is estimated to be about $1,300 in 2017. The amount would be correspondingly lower for households with fewer members."
illegal access to health promotion board's healthhub accounts in september and october 2018,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Health (a) whether he can provide an update on the attempts to illegally access Health Promotion Board's (HPB) HealthHub accounts in September and October 2018; (b) why are the hackers still able to attack the accounts despite remedial steps taken; and (c) how can users of the apps developed by HPB be assured that their identities are being kept safe.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Health Promotion Board (HPB) and Integrated Health Information Systems (IHiS) investigated a case of unusually high number of attempts to log into HealthHub on four days within a short period (that is, 28 September 2018, 3 October 2018, 8 October 2018 and 9 October 2018). The investigation revealed that attempts were made with more than 27,000 email addresses. 98% of the email addresses used were not related to HealthHub account IDs, and these attempts were unsuccessful. Nevertheless, 72 accounts were successfully accessed during the four days.The high volume of email addresses not related to HealthHub account IDs and the repeated attempts suggest that the email addresses used were likely to have been obtained from other compromised sources. No evidence of a breach in the HealthHub system has been found.The unusual log-in attempts and access were limited to the basic tier of HealthHub, which contained the user's self-populated profile and any Healthpoints accumulated through participation in HPB programmes. Access to other e-services requires SingPass and 2-factor authentication, and were not affected.As a precaution, access to all HealthHub mobile application and HealthHub website e-services were suspended from 9 to 14 October 2018. The 72 HealthHub accounts of concern were locked, and HPB contacted each of the account holders to ascertain if the log-ins were legitimate and to alert them of the access to their accounts. The investigation found that none of the accounts were adversely affected. 15 users had legitimately logged into their accounts, while two users suspected that their accounts were accessed without authorisation. It was inconclusive as to whether the remaining 55 accounts were accessed without authorisation. HPB provided all the 72 account holders with advice on how they could unlock their accounts and reset the passwords.HPB has included a security advisory in HealthHub to remind users on the need to use strong passwords for their online accounts and to refrain from using the same password for different websites and applications. In December 2018, further precautionary measures were also implemented, including (i) introducing an authentication at the point of login that protects against automated attacks by malicious bots; and (ii) introducing a One Time Password (OTP) for the redemption of Healthpoints.IHiS and HPB have not detected further incidents of unusual log-ins since. They will continue to strengthen their systems for better protection, monitoring and response to cyber threats."
current number of informal and professional caregivers in singapore,Ms Anthea Ong asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the current number of informal and professional care-givers in Singapore; (b) what is the total value of the informal versus the professional care-giving sector; and (c) how many salaried working persons left employment to be primary care-givers in the last three years and what is the demographic profile of these persons.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Caregiving needs will grow as our population ages, and the Government is expanding home and community care services, to support families and provide care-givers with peace of mind. As of 2017, we have about 8,300 staff providing direct care1 to seniors in the long-term care sector2. However, families and friends are also an important source of care and support for our seniors. Based on the National Health Surveillance Survey conducted in 2010 and 2013, around 6% – 8% of Singapore residents aged 18 – 69 provide regular informal care or assistance to family and friends with health issues, long-term illnesses or disability. As informal care-giving arrangements vary, we do not have available estimates of the total value of informal care-giving to make a direct comparison with formal care-giving.Some working persons may leave the workforce to focus on family responsibilities. Based on the Ministry of Manpower's 2017 Comprehensive Labour Force Survey, 202,000 residents left their job within the last three years and were not looking for a job. Of this number, about 12,500 residents cited family care-giving to families or relatives as the main reason, and the majority of these residents were females, married and aged 40 and over.We also recognise the important roles that family care-givers play, and the need to take a whole-of-community approach to support them. The Government will continue to review how we can further encourage ageing in place and provide more direct and holistic support for care-givers of seniors."
role of overseas missions towards singaporeans in distress in foreign countries,"Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs (a) what is the role of our Overseas Missions towards Singaporeans and their family members who face unfortunate and sudden circumstances such as a serious illness, accident or death in a foreign country; and (b) in such circumstances, to what extent will our Overseas Missions assist Singaporeans with logistical arrangements to receive medical care and/or repatriation to Singapore, if necessary.","Dr Vivian Balakrishnan: Our Overseas Missions provide timely consular assistance, support and advice to Singaporeans in distress overseas. For major incidents such as serious illness, injury or death, we will contact the local authorities to ensure that appropriate medical care is provided; and help the family with the administrative processes to bring the affected Singaporean home.For example, following a bus accident in Makkah last year, our Consulate-General in Jeddah visited several hospitals, worked with the local authorities to locate all affected Singaporean pilgrims, and ensured that those injured received due medical care. Unfortunately, one Singaporean passed on. Our officers rendered consular assistance to his family who arrived from Singapore, and facilitated the burial in Makkah. MFA also worked closely with MUIS and the travel insurance company to facilitate the medical repatriation of another Singaporean, as well as the safe return of the remaining pilgrims.We will continue to do our best to provide prompt and effective consular service to Singaporeans. While MFA cannot bear the expenses incurred for medical care and repatriation, we will liaise with the family and work with relevant Singapore agencies such as MOH, CPFB and MSF, to explore if overseas medical expenses and associated costs can be covered under Medisave or other forms of assistance. In order to have adequate financial protection against unexpected emergencies, Singaporeans should always purchase travel and medical insurance when travelling overseas.  "
tuberculosis cases among foreign domestic workers in singapore in last five years,Mr Yee Chia Hsing asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the number of tuberculosis (TB) cases discovered among foreign domestic workers (FDWs) in Singapore over the last five years; and (b) whether additional measures can be made to prevent the spread of TB among FDWs and from FDWs to their employers.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Foreign domestic workers (FDWs) applying to work in Singapore are required to be screened for active TB, including having a chest x-ray, within two weeks of their arrival in Singapore, before they are issued with work permits. FDWs are also required to undergo screening for active TB upon two years of stay in Singapore.From 2013 to 2017, an average of 146 new FDW applicants a year were diagnosed with active TB when they applied for work permit. FDW applicants found to have active TB will not be issued work permits and have to return to their home countries, unless otherwise supported by their prospective employers. In the same period, about 200 FDW work permit holders were diagnosed with active TB per year, out of a FDW population of between 214,500 and 246,800.As active TB can still develop later after screening is negative, it is imperative that persons who display symptoms of active TB, such as unexplained prolonged cough of three weeks or more, seek early medical attention, so that active TB can be detected and treated early. With treatment, persons with active TB rapidly become non-infectious, and would no longer transmit the disease. Strict adherence to TB treatment will help ensure cure and minimise the risk of relapse of the disease.Therefore, to reduce the risk of TB transmission, we seek the support of employers with FDWs displaying TB symptoms to seek medical attention for their FDWs early. Employers should also support and ensure that their FDWs receive TB treatment, via Directly Observed Treatment (DOT), and comply with medical appointments."
progress of pilot pre-implantation genetic screening programme at national university hospital,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the progress of the pilot Pre-Implantation Genetic Screening programme at the National University Hospital; (b) whether it is on track for completion in 2020; (c) what is the eligibility criteria for joining the programme; (d) whether private patients will be able to join the programme; and (e) what is the number of participants in the programme thus far.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: MOH started a three year pilot on Pre-Implantation Genetic Screening (PGS)1 in 2017. Under the pilot programme, patients who fulfil at least one of the following clinical criteria will be eligible:(a)  Age 35 years old and above, regardless of prognosis(b)  Two or more recurrent implantation failures, regardless of age(c)   Two or more recurrent pregnancy losses, regardless of ageEligible patients from the three public Assisted Reproduction (AR) centres (i.e. NUH, KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKWCH) and Singapore General Hospital (SGH)) can be referred to the NUH lab to undergo PGS. Patients from the private hospitals can also be referred to the three public AR centres for assessment.As of December 2018, 221 patients were recruited under the PGS programme and MOH will review the pilot programme after completion."
offence of offering cigarettes to persons below 21 years of age,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Health (a) whether someone who offers a cigarette to a person below the age of 21 is committing an offence; (b) whether the receiver of the cigarette is also an offender; (c) how many of such offenders have been booked in the past three years; and (d) what has been the fine imposed on these offenders.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The current minimum legal age (MLA) for the purchase, use, possession, sale and supply of tobacco products is 19 years. This was raised from 18 years on 1 January 2019 and will be raised progressively to 21 years by 1 January 2021. Offering a cigarette to a person below the MLA is an offence under Section 10 of the Tobacco (Control of Advertisements and Sale) Act (TCASA). Receiving a cigarette is also an offence if they are under the MLA under Section 11 of the TCASA.The main focus of Health Sciences Authority's (HSA) enforcement efforts is on curbing the sale of tobacco to under aged persons. Errant retailers are liable to a maximum fine of $5,000 for the first offence and $10,000 for subsequent offences. In addition, the tobacco retail license will be suspended for the first offence and revoked for subsequent offences. Between January 2015 and October 2018, 90 retailers have been caught for selling tobacco to under aged persons.In addition, anyone caught buying or acquiring any tobacco product for a person below the MLA, is liable on conviction in Court, to a maximum fine of $2,500 for the first offence and $5,000 for subsequent offences. Similarly, anyone caught giving or furnishing tobacco product to a person below the MLA, is liable on conviction in Court, to a maximum fine of $500 for the first offence and $1,000 for subsequent offences. Between January 2015 and October 2018, 18 people had been caught for such offences."
published fee benchmarks for surgical procedures at private hospitals,Prof Fatimah Lateef asked the Minister for Health how does the Ministry intend to monitor the acceptance and compliance of the recently published fee benchmarks for surgical procedures at private hospitals.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The objective of publishing fee benchmarks is to provide all stakeholders a reference on the reasonable ranges of professional fees for common surgical procedures in the private sector. The benchmarks will guide private sector healthcare providers in charging appropriately. They will also enable patients and payers to make more informed decisions.Doctors should take reference from the benchmarks in setting their fees and advising their patients. They should also be prepared to explain to patients where their charges exceed the range, such as when addressing a highly complex case or in exceptional circumstances.Today, MOH already monitors overall hospital bill sizes and doctors' charges. Where we observe charging patterns that could be of concern, we will query the healthcare providers, investigate and take follow up actions if necessary.MOH welcomes feedback on the fee benchmarks. These would help to guide future review and refinement of the benchmarks."
measures in place to assist singaporeans with no access to or unable to make online applications for nrics or passports,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what are the measures that will be put in place to assist Singaporeans with no access to or who are unable to make online applications for NRICs or passports; and (b) whether some of these measures will be retained beyond 2020 when ICA seeks to have all such applications to be made online.,"Mr K Shanmugam: For those with no access to the Internet, or who are unable to make online applications for NRICs or passports:(a) Family members and friends can apply online on their behalf.(b) Self-service kiosks are also available at the eLobby of the ICA Building, with ICA Service Ambassadors on hand to assist and guide applicants through the application process.(c) ICA can make special arrangements to assist those who are unable to make a trip to ICA due to medical reasons. For example, those who are bedridden and are required to re-register for their NRIC can request ICA to conduct the re-registration at their residence.All these measures will be available even beyond 2020."
latest figure for average household expenditure on basic needs,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Trade and Industry what is the latest figure for the Average Household Expenditure on Basic Needs (AHEBN) for all available household sizes by number of persons.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: The Average Household Expenditure on Basic Needs (AHEBN) is an estimate of the average monthly expenditure that households spend on essential needs such as food, clothing and shelter.The AHEBN for a four-person household is estimated to be about $1,300 in 2017. The amount would be correspondingly lower for households with fewer members."
"causes of mass food poisonings in october, november and december 2018","Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what are the causes of the mass food poisonings in October, November and December 2018 from food prepared at five different places; and (b) whether rules can be implemented requiring eateries or caterers to notify the public or potential customers as to the reasons for a suspension of their licence.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: In October, November and December 2018, there were 5 reported food poisoning incidents, involving Team Catering Pte Ltd, Tung Lok Catering, FoodTalks Caterer & Manufacturer, Spize Restaurant @ River Valley and Mandarin Orchard Hotel.The joint investigations by the Ministry of Health (MOH), Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA) and National Environment Agency (NEA) confirmed that there were no links between the incidents. In the case of Spize Restaurant, it was a Salmonellosis outbreak of unusual severity which suggests that the food was heavily contaminated. There was strong evidence of poor personal hygiene and food handling practices by food handlers leading to contamination of ready-to-eat food and the environment. The operator was also found to have seven unregistered food handlers and preparing food outside of the licensed premises. In the case of Team Catering Pte Ltd, a number of possible commonly-found pathogens were identified from the human stool samples, including Clostridium Perfringens and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and several hygiene lapses and poor kitchen habits were identified, including improper storage of knives and poor housekeeping. In the case of FoodTalks Caterer & Manufacturer and Tung Lok Millennium Pte Ltd, while the causative pathogen could not be identified for both outbreaks, several food hygiene lapses were found at their premises, for example, no proper segregation between raw and ready-to-eat food in the same chiller compartment, no provision of hand washing facilities, and cockroach infestation. For the case at Mandarin Orchard Hotel, the outbreak was caused by environmental contamination of the Grand Ballroom with norovirus – a common virus that causes gastroenteritis, which was propagated by poor environmental and personal hygiene practices such as improper cleaning of vomitus and banquet servers continuing to work while ill.NEA has taken tough actions against the food operators who have violated the law. The operating licence of Spize Restaurant at River Valley Road was terminated and NEA will also press charges against the operator in Court. The operating licences of Tung Lok, as well as the ballroom and affected kitchen in Mandarin Hotel, will remain suspended until the operators have complied with the requirements imposed by NEA, which includes sanitising the affected areas, reviewing the processes and rectifying the lapses. For the lapses found at FoodTalks, NEA will be issuing summons to the operator. For selling food that is found unfit for human consumption, operators may face a penalty of up to $10,000 for the first offence, and in the case of repeat offenders, a fine of $20,000 or imprisonment of 3 months or both.In addition to strengthening the overall regulatory framework for food operators, NEA will enhance NEA's website and the myENV app to make it easier for consumers to check the food hygiene records of the operators. We are also looking into measures to better notify the public about a food operator's licence suspension. Consumers are urged to engage only licensed caterers, and consume catered food within the stipulated 'consume by' time period. Consumers who come across poor hygiene practices in food establishments should provide feedback to the authorities for further investigation."
update on nea’s implementation of smoke-free zone in orchard road area,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether he can update the House on NEA's implementation of a smoke-free zone in the Orchard Road area; and (b) what are the challenges faced in designating smoking areas in this part of the city with high human traffic.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The Orchard Road No-Smoking Zone (NSZ) was brought into force on 1 January 2019, as part of the Government's long term goal of achieving a smoke-free Singapore.  Over the past few months, the National Environment Agency (NEA) has been actively publicising the NSZ through various platforms. Signs demarcating the boundary of the NSZ have been erected at lamp posts and dustbins, while advertisements have been put up at MRT stations and selected bus stops and on buses plying Orchard Road. Community Volunteers have been engaging the public in the NSZ to raise awareness, while publicity materials are being displayed at our points of entry and on the Singapore Tourism Board's Visit Singapore webpage to alert foreign visitors to the prohibition. Travel agents, tour guides and hotels have also been informed about the NSZ so that they can advise tourists accordingly.Prior to implementing the NSZ, NEA had worked closely with the Orchard Road Business Association (ORBA) and building owners and managers to ensure sufficient provision of designated smoking areas (DSAs). There are now more than 40 DSAs within the NSZ, spaced about 100 to 200 metres apart. As footfall along the shopping belt is particularly heavy, efforts have been made to ensure that the DSAs are located away from the pedestrian thoroughfare. Smokers can find the location of these DSAs on the OneMap and NEA's website, the myENV mobile application, and through publicity brochures disseminated at shopping malls and tobacco retailers within the NSZ. We are monitoring the use of the DSAs, and will assess the effectiveness of the NSZ in reducing the public's exposure to second-hand smoke."
average number of foreign-registered motor vehicles driven in singapore on a given day by vehicle type,"Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) in the past 12 months, what is the average number of foreign-registered motor vehicles being driven in Singapore on a given day, broken down by vehicle type; and (b) whether further measures will be taken by LTA to ensure that these motor vehicles comply with Singapore's regulations on the control of exhaust and noise emissions.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: In the last 12 months (between November 2017 and October 2018), foreign registered vehicles made about 24 million trips into Singapore through land checkpoints, or about 2 million trips per month. About 78% are made by motorcycles, 15% by cars and the remainder by goods vehicles, buses and taxis. To ensure compliance with the Environmental Protection and Management (Vehicular Emissions) Regulations, the National Environment Agency (""NEA"") enforces against smoky foreign vehicles at the Tuas and Woodlands entry checkpoints. Notices of composition are issued on the spot if foreign vehicles fail the smoke emissions test. Foreign commercial vehicles emitting excessive smoke will also be turned back immediately. In addition, NEA works with the Land Transport Authority (""LTA"") and the Traffic Police (""TP"") to enforce against noisy foreign vehicles during joint blitzes. We will continue to look at measures to reduce emissions from foreign vehicles. Members of public who spot smoky or noisy vehicles on the road are encouraged to report them to NEA via the online feedback form at: www.nea.gov.sg, myENV application or the NEA hotline."
monitoring of ambient air quality of civil and military airports and their vicinity,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether the Government monitors the ambient air quality of all civil and military airports and their vicinity and keep track of the pollution index for pollutants like nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxides, sulphur oxides, particulate matter and volatile organic compounds; (b) if it does not keep track of any of such pollutants, whether it will consider doing so; and (c) whether such data can be made available to the public.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The National Environment Agency (NEA) monitors and reports the air quality in Singapore through a network of five national air quality monitoring stations across the island. These stations are representative of the ambient air quality of the five regions, within which the civil and military airports are located. Criteria pollutants, namely, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, ozone, particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), are continuously monitored and reported on an hourly basis as the Pollutants Standard Index (PSI). In 2018, the air quality in Singapore remained in the 'Good' and 'Moderate' range for 100% of the days, based on Singapore's PSI readings. The PSI reading is made available every hour on the NEA and haze websites, as well as on myENV app. Additionally, NEA continuously monitors the ambient concentration of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC), which are typically emitted by the industries. The VOC levels monitored in Singapore are comparable with the major EU, Japan and US cities."
requirement to dispose private property within six months of effective date of purchase of non-subsidised or resale flat,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for National Development with regard to the requirement to dispose private property within six months of the effective date of purchasing a non-subsidised or resale flat (a) how many cases of private residential property in Singapore and overseas have been so disposed since the inception of this policy; (b) how many appeals asking for retention of such property have the Ministry received; and (c) how many of such appeals are approved and what is the basis for the approval.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB flats are meant for owner-occupation. To reinforce this principle, buyers of HDB resale flats are not allowed to retain ownership of local or overseas private properties. Since the policy was introduced in August 2010, slightly over 5,000 households have disposed of their private properties when they purchased flats from the resale market. In the last 3 years, about 1,200 households appealed to retain their private property. Of these, HDB acceded to about 300 appeals after considering the specific facts of each case, taking into account factors such as the owner's share in the private property, and the reasons why the private property cannot be recovered for his or her own use."
percentages of students living in hdb flats under public rental scheme,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Education for each year in the past five years, what are the percentages of students who live in HDB flats under the Public Rental Scheme who enter the (i) Normal (Technical) (ii) Normal (Academic) and (iii) Express streams respectively.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: Social economic status has become significantly correlated with PSLE results. This is inevitable as lives improved and lower income families make progress over the years, with children doing better than their parents. So percentage of students in Normal streams living in public rental HDB flats are higher than that in Express stream. This is why MOE is undertaking various measures, including the UPLIFT Taskforce, to help lift the performance of students at the bottom."
"tamil as third language, in addition to malay and chinese","Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Education whether the Ministry will consider offering Tamil as a third language to students who have the ability and aptitude to learn a third language, in addition to Malay and Chinese that have already been offered to such students.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: MOE is committed to promoting the learning of our Mother Tongue Languages, including Tamil, and we continually look for ways to enhance it.MOE is open to offering Tamil as a third language if there is sufficient demand for it. However, current demand for it among non-Tamil students is low. We will review the matter if the situation changes.In the meantime, we will continue to support our students learning the language as their Mother Tongue in schools, with well-qualified Tamil language teachers and quality teaching resources."
number of subsidised and non-subsidised food and beverage stalls in hawker centres and average rent paid in past 12 months,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what is the current number of subsidised and non-subsidised food and beverage stalls in hawker centres; and (b) what is the average rent paid by these subsidised and non-subsidised food and beverage stalls in the past 12 months.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: There are over 6,000 cooked food stalls in the 114 hawker centres owned by the Government. Of these, about 40% (2,294) of stallholders pay subsidised rent.  The rent for subsidised cooked food stalls is either $192 or $320 per month, depending on the scope of upgrading works carried out during the Hawker Centres Upgrading Programme (HUP). Rents for non-subsidised cooked food stalls are on average about $1,300 per month as of November 2018."
percentages of students on financial assistance scheme,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Education for each year in the past five years, what are the percentages of students who receive assistance from the Ministry's Financial Assistance Scheme who are from the (i) Normal (Technical) (ii) Normal (Academic) and (iii) Express streams respectively.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: From 2014 to 2018, 28% of secondary school students who received assistance from the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme were from the Normal (Technical) stream; 41% were from the Normal (Academic) stream; 31% were from the Express stream. The percentages for each of the five years were similar."
measures taken to strengthen institution of marriage among young couples,Mr Mohamed Irshad asked the Minister for Social and Family Development what are the measures taken by the Ministry to strengthen the institution of marriage among young couples and to encourage them to get married.,"Mr Desmond Lee: Based on the 2016 Marriage and Parenthood Survey, 83% of Singaporeans aged 21 to 35 who are single aspire to get married. The Government will continue to support their marriage aspirations. Most singles prefer meeting potential partners in natural settings, such as at recreational or social activities, or through introductions by friends and colleagues. We have therefore been working with partner agencies to identify natural settings for singles to meet, grow their social networks and form meaningful relationships. These include events such as Sports Hub's 'Community Play Day' and the Urban Redevelopment Authority’s 'Countdown@Civic District'. The Social Development Network, or SDN, funds initiatives by community partners and organisations to bring singles together. SDN also helps dating agencies improve their services through accreditation and funding. To provide more interaction opportunities through interest- and activity-based initiatives, SDN organises the Spark Connections campaign twice a year, where accredited agencies offer a wide array of events and programmes at subsidised prices, ranging from trendy, lifestyle based events to self-development workshops.We also recognise that many couples aspire to have a home of their own when they get married. We have stepped up our efforts to make it faster and easier for young couples who have decided to settle down to apply for a flat. Since 2015, HDB has launched more than 50,000 new Build-To-Order (BTO) flats, with at least 70% to 85% of these set aside for first-timer families. First-timer families applying for a BTO flat in non-mature estates will be able to select a flat within two to three tries. HDB also launched the first batch of 1,100 BTO flats with shorter waiting times of about 2 to 3 years in 2018, with another 2,000 such flats scheduled for launch in 2019. We have also enhanced housing grants for resale flats, to better support couples who choose to buy resale flats. HDB has also introduced flexibility in 2018 to allow young couples who are studying or serving NS to defer their income assessment for housing loans and grants till before keys collection, instead of at the point of flat application, when they may not have met the minimum period of employment to qualify for housing grants.Besides helping singles find suitable partners, we must also continue to strengthen and support marriages. MSF works closely with our partners to offer marriage preparation programmes to couples of all ages. These programmes help couples better understand their roles and manage their expectations of married life. The programmes also equip them with useful communication and conflict resolution skills. Tailored programmes are also available for couples with specific needs, such as cross-cultural and remarrying couples.Couples who marry at a very young age may need more support to prepare for marriage. They may also face additional stress if they become parents shortly after marriage, increasing the risk of marital conflict. Hence, we have recently made it mandatory for couples where either party is a minor (below 21 years old) to undergo marriage preparation programmes before they can apply for marriage. This applies for both civil and Muslim marriages. These programmes include group marriage education workshops that equip couples with skills and knowledge on topics such as communication, conflict resolution and management of household finances, and one-to-one consultation sessions to help couples make informed decisions about marriage. There are also optional post-marriage programmes to provide continued support for couples in areas such as marriage enrichment and parenting.Marriage is hard work and the relationship needs to be constantly nurtured. We work with partners such as the Families for Life Council and family life and marriage educators to provide a suite of marriage enrichment programmes at workplaces and in the community, to equip couples with insights and tips to strengthen their marriages. The Families for Life Council also organises an annual ""I Still Do"" initiative, where there are marriage talks, bonding activities and online content to engage couples in conversations on marriage, and encourage couples to continue to date and reaffirm their commitment to each other.

"studies to evaluate impact of progressive wage model on number of persons employed in cleaning, security and landscape sectors","Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Manpower whether there are reviews or studies available to evaluate the impact of the Progressive Wage Model (PWM) on the number of persons employed in the cleaning, security and landscape sectors and, if so, what do the studies suggest has been the impact on employment numbers of the PWM thus far.","Mrs Josephine Teo: The Progressive Wage Model (PWM) was implemented in the Cleaning, Security and Landscape sectors as a targeted intervention to address low and stagnant wages caused by market failure of cheap sourcing. It aims to raise the salaries of local workers in these sectors by providing a clear progression ladder for workers to earn higher and sustainable wages as they become more skilled, more productive and take on higher job responsibilities.The number of local workers employed in these three sectors depends on many factors beyond PWM itself, such as the state of the economy, adoption of labour saving technologies, improvements to company's business processes, and changes in foreign worker (FW) policies. It is difficult to attribute changes to local employment numbers to the PWM alone.What is clear, however, is that since the PWM was implemented, workers in these three sectors have seen positive real wage growth. Between 2011 and 2016, the real median gross wages of full-time resident cleaners, security guards and landscape maintenance employees increased by 32%, 36% and 16% respectively. This was achieved while keeping local unemployment rate low at around 3% and maintaining employment rate1 at a healthy level of around 80%."
measures to teach students to spot signs and symptoms of depression and seek help,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Social and Family Development how can the Ministry work more closely with the Ministry of Education to teach students to spot signs and symptoms of depression and seek help for themselves or their family and friends.,"Mr Desmond Lee: It is important to strengthen our children's social and emotional resilience so that they can manage stress well and cope with future challenges. MSF works closely with the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Health and other agencies to support our children and youth in their mental well-being. For instance, MSF was part of the NurtureSG Taskforce that made recommendations to improve the health outcomes of our children and youth, including their mental well-being.In schools, the Character and Citizenship Education curriculum aims to raise awareness of mental health, reduce stigmatisation associated with mental health issues, help both staff and students to recognise signs of distress, for example, unexplained injuries, sending or posting moody messages online, and encourage them to seek help for themselves and others around them. Students are also taught to look out for and support one another, and to alert their teachers, school counsellors or parents if their friends are affected by difficulties. School counsellors may refer children with psycho-social issues to mental health professionals.Family members and members of the community can also play a role to spot students with depression symptoms. For example, members of the community may encourage individuals or families in need to approach a Family Service Centre (FSC) for assistance. The social workers at the FSCs will work with the school and other specialists in the community to provide holistic interventions to the student and his/her family to overcome their issues and support them towards long-term stability."
singaporeans who have not done their cpf nominations,"Mr Seah Kian Peng asked the Minister for Manpower to date, how many Singaporeans have not done their CPF nominations and how can this gap be closed.","Mrs Josephine Teo: As of December 2018, about 58% of CPF members aged 16 and above do not have a valid nomination. Among older members aged 55 and above, 30% do not have a valid nomination. These include members who have never made a nomination, as well as members who made a nomination that was revoked by marriage and did not make a subsequent nomination. CPF Board will continue to work with its industry and community partners to encourage members to make a nomination through various touchpoints. For example, CPF Board provides information on CPF nomination to industry bodies such as the Law Society and Life Insurance Association, so that their members (that is, lawyers and insurance agents) can educate their respective clients on the distribution of CPF savings upon death. The Board also encourages members to make a nomination through members' Yearly Statement of Accounts and when they attend the CPF Retirement Planning Service at age 54. These targeted measures are complemented by public education efforts through CPF Board's social media channels, talks, roadshows and website."
plans for more education and career guidance counsellors in schools,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for Education (a) whether there are plans to bring more Education and Career Guidance (ECG) counsellors specialised in different fields to each school; and (b) how are schools involving parents in the ECG curriculum.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: As at end 2018, MOE has deployed ninety-seven Education and Career Guidance (ECG) Counsellors to MOE Secondary and Pre-University schools, ITE colleges and Polytechnics. ECG Counsellors complement and support the teachers, academic staff and mentors who provide frontline ECG support to students. We are currently focused on improving the curriculum and methods of ECG, and there is currently no plan to further expand the pool of ECG Counsellors. Parents are our key partners in helping students to discover their strengths, aptitude and interests and make informed educational and career decisions. Schools engage parents regularly to raise awareness of educational and career pathways and on ways of engaging their children to discuss their career options and choices. "
breakdown of students taking third language course in past five years,Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Education in the past five years (a) what is the total number of students taking a third language course and the breakdown for each year; (b) what is the percentage of students completing the third language courses and taking them in the GCE 'O' level examination; and (c) what is the number of passes for these examinations.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: In the past five years, the total number of students studying a third language has remained stable at approximately 6,000.Each year, about 30% of Third Language students would complete the course and sit for the GCE O Level examinations. The average pass rate is 96%. The reason given by students for dropping third languages is typically the difficulty of coping with this additional subject when their academic and CCA commitments grow as they progress further in their secondary schools."
last full-time or part-time job held by persons who have passed on by age group,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Manpower currently, what is the last full-time or part-time job held by persons who have passed on, broken down by age groups of (i) 85 to 90 years (ii) 80 to 84 years (iii) 75 to 79 years (iv) 70 to 74 years (v) 65 to 69 years (vi) 60 to 64 years (vii) 55 to 59 years and (viii) 50 to 54 years.",Mrs Josephine Teo: MOM does not track the last held jobs of persons who have passed on. 
annual number of applications for nric and passport in past five years,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is the annual number of applications for NRIC and passport respectively in the past five years; (b) how many of these applications are online applications; and (c) what are the age profiles of those who have submitted non-online applications.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The annual number of passport applications, the proportion of online applications, and the age profiles of those who submitted non-online applications can be found in Tables 1A and 1B below.NRIC applications are received mainly through the mandatory NRIC registration and re-registration exercises at age 15, 30 and 55, as well as the optional NRIC re-registration exercise for those born before 1 January 1962 that is, those above age 55 as at 1 January 2017). In addition, NRIC applications are also submitted by those who wish to change their NRIC particulars, or to replace their lost or damaged NRICs.For each of the above groups, the annual number of applications, and the proportion of online applications can be found in Table 2 below."
illegal access to health promotion board's healthhub accounts in september and october 2018,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Health (a) whether he can provide an update on the attempts to illegally access Health Promotion Board's (HPB) HealthHub accounts in September and October 2018; (b) why are the hackers still able to attack the accounts despite remedial steps taken; and (c) how can users of the apps developed by HPB be assured that their identities are being kept safe.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Health Promotion Board (HPB) and Integrated Health Information Systems (IHiS) investigated a case of unusually high number of attempts to log into HealthHub on four days within a short period (that is, 28 September 2018, 3 October 2018, 8 October 2018 and 9 October 2018). The investigation revealed that attempts were made with more than 27,000 email addresses. 98% of the email addresses used were not related to HealthHub account IDs, and these attempts were unsuccessful. Nevertheless, 72 accounts were successfully accessed during the four days.The high volume of email addresses not related to HealthHub account IDs and the repeated attempts suggest that the email addresses used were likely to have been obtained from other compromised sources. No evidence of a breach in the HealthHub system has been found.The unusual log-in attempts and access were limited to the basic tier of HealthHub, which contained the user's self-populated profile and any Healthpoints accumulated through participation in HPB programmes. Access to other e-services requires SingPass and 2-factor authentication, and were not affected.As a precaution, access to all HealthHub mobile application and HealthHub website e-services were suspended from 9 to 14 October 2018. The 72 HealthHub accounts of concern were locked, and HPB contacted each of the account holders to ascertain if the log-ins were legitimate and to alert them of the access to their accounts. The investigation found that none of the accounts were adversely affected. 15 users had legitimately logged into their accounts, while two users suspected that their accounts were accessed without authorisation. It was inconclusive as to whether the remaining 55 accounts were accessed without authorisation. HPB provided all the 72 account holders with advice on how they could unlock their accounts and reset the passwords.HPB has included a security advisory in HealthHub to remind users on the need to use strong passwords for their online accounts and to refrain from using the same password for different websites and applications. In December 2018, further precautionary measures were also implemented, including (i) introducing an authentication at the point of login that protects against automated attacks by malicious bots; and (ii) introducing a One Time Password (OTP) for the redemption of Healthpoints.IHiS and HPB have not detected further incidents of unusual log-ins since. They will continue to strengthen their systems for better protection, monitoring and response to cyber threats."
proportion of saf officers offered re-employment at retirement age,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Defence (a) what is the current proportion of SAF officers who are offered re-employment at retirement age; and (b) what are the measures to retrain and redeploy older SAF officers.,"Dr Ng Eng Hen: As a military with physical demands required to fulfil its mission, officers and other ranks of personnel within the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) do not adhere to the retirement age of commercial companies and civilian organisations. Most officers and warrant officers retire around 50 years old as there are only limited vocations for re-employment across the SAF. Military experts can work till 60 years of age. However, the shorter career spans within the SAF is made up by higher remuneration packages as compared to equivalent civilian jobs.  In addition, the SAF has specific programmes to prepare personnel for their second careers. 80% secure jobs within six months of retiring from the SAF. These programmes include structured training to prepare them for leadership and management roles and other valuable competencies in areas such as human resource, finance, operations research and training pedagogy. Our training programmes are accredited by external agencies, and in some cases developed jointly with local educational institutions. Employer surveys show that the skills and certifications obtained by SAF personnel during their careers are well-recognised by private and public sector employers. MINDEF established the Career Transition Resource Centre (CTRC) in 2009 to further support our retiring personnel, by equipping them with the skills to enhance their employability. Under the Lifelong Employability & Advancement Programme (LEAP), retiring personnel are provided funds and time off to attend courses and seminars, go for job interviews, and embark on internships that can serve as a springboard into their sector of interest. They can also avail themselves of personalised one-on-one career coaching and job referral services through CTRC's certified career advisors. "
role of overseas missions towards singaporeans in distress in foreign countries,"Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs (a) what is the role of our Overseas Missions towards Singaporeans and their family members who face unfortunate and sudden circumstances such as a serious illness, accident or death in a foreign country; and (b) in such circumstances, to what extent will our Overseas Missions assist Singaporeans with logistical arrangements to receive medical care and/or repatriation to Singapore, if necessary.","Dr Vivian Balakrishnan: Our Overseas Missions provide timely consular assistance, support and advice to Singaporeans in distress overseas. For major incidents such as serious illness, injury or death, we will contact the local authorities to ensure that appropriate medical care is provided; and help the family with the administrative processes to bring the affected Singaporean home.For example, following a bus accident in Makkah last year, our Consulate-General in Jeddah visited several hospitals, worked with the local authorities to locate all affected Singaporean pilgrims, and ensured that those injured received due medical care. Unfortunately, one Singaporean passed on. Our officers rendered consular assistance to his family who arrived from Singapore, and facilitated the burial in Makkah. MFA also worked closely with MUIS and the travel insurance company to facilitate the medical repatriation of another Singaporean, as well as the safe return of the remaining pilgrims.We will continue to do our best to provide prompt and effective consular service to Singaporeans. While MFA cannot bear the expenses incurred for medical care and repatriation, we will liaise with the family and work with relevant Singapore agencies such as MOH, CPFB and MSF, to explore if overseas medical expenses and associated costs can be covered under Medisave or other forms of assistance. In order to have adequate financial protection against unexpected emergencies, Singaporeans should always purchase travel and medical insurance when travelling overseas.  "
tuberculosis cases among foreign domestic workers in singapore in last five years,Mr Yee Chia Hsing asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the number of tuberculosis (TB) cases discovered among foreign domestic workers (FDWs) in Singapore over the last five years; and (b) whether additional measures can be made to prevent the spread of TB among FDWs and from FDWs to their employers.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Foreign domestic workers (FDWs) applying to work in Singapore are required to be screened for active TB, including having a chest x-ray, within two weeks of their arrival in Singapore, before they are issued with work permits. FDWs are also required to undergo screening for active TB upon two years of stay in Singapore.From 2013 to 2017, an average of 146 new FDW applicants a year were diagnosed with active TB when they applied for work permit. FDW applicants found to have active TB will not be issued work permits and have to return to their home countries, unless otherwise supported by their prospective employers. In the same period, about 200 FDW work permit holders were diagnosed with active TB per year, out of a FDW population of between 214,500 and 246,800.As active TB can still develop later after screening is negative, it is imperative that persons who display symptoms of active TB, such as unexplained prolonged cough of three weeks or more, seek early medical attention, so that active TB can be detected and treated early. With treatment, persons with active TB rapidly become non-infectious, and would no longer transmit the disease. Strict adherence to TB treatment will help ensure cure and minimise the risk of relapse of the disease.Therefore, to reduce the risk of TB transmission, we seek the support of employers with FDWs displaying TB symptoms to seek medical attention for their FDWs early. Employers should also support and ensure that their FDWs receive TB treatment, via Directly Observed Treatment (DOT), and comply with medical appointments."
progress of pilot pre-implantation genetic screening programme at national university hospital,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the progress of the pilot Pre-Implantation Genetic Screening programme at the National University Hospital; (b) whether it is on track for completion in 2020; (c) what is the eligibility criteria for joining the programme; (d) whether private patients will be able to join the programme; and (e) what is the number of participants in the programme thus far.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: MOH started a three year pilot on Pre-Implantation Genetic Screening (PGS)1 in 2017. Under the pilot programme, patients who fulfil at least one of the following clinical criteria will be eligible:(a)  Age 35 years old and above, regardless of prognosis(b)  Two or more recurrent implantation failures, regardless of age(c)   Two or more recurrent pregnancy losses, regardless of ageEligible patients from the three public Assisted Reproduction (AR) centres (i.e. NUH, KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKWCH) and Singapore General Hospital (SGH)) can be referred to the NUH lab to undergo PGS. Patients from the private hospitals can also be referred to the three public AR centres for assessment.As of December 2018, 221 patients were recruited under the PGS programme and MOH will review the pilot programme after completion."
offence of offering cigarettes to persons below 21 years of age,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Health (a) whether someone who offers a cigarette to a person below the age of 21 is committing an offence; (b) whether the receiver of the cigarette is also an offender; (c) how many of such offenders have been booked in the past three years; and (d) what has been the fine imposed on these offenders.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The current minimum legal age (MLA) for the purchase, use, possession, sale and supply of tobacco products is 19 years. This was raised from 18 years on 1 January 2019 and will be raised progressively to 21 years by 1 January 2021. Offering a cigarette to a person below the MLA is an offence under Section 10 of the Tobacco (Control of Advertisements and Sale) Act (TCASA). Receiving a cigarette is also an offence if they are under the MLA under Section 11 of the TCASA.The main focus of Health Sciences Authority's (HSA) enforcement efforts is on curbing the sale of tobacco to under aged persons. Errant retailers are liable to a maximum fine of $5,000 for the first offence and $10,000 for subsequent offences. In addition, the tobacco retail license will be suspended for the first offence and revoked for subsequent offences. Between January 2015 and October 2018, 90 retailers have been caught for selling tobacco to under aged persons.In addition, anyone caught buying or acquiring any tobacco product for a person below the MLA, is liable on conviction in Court, to a maximum fine of $2,500 for the first offence and $5,000 for subsequent offences. Similarly, anyone caught giving or furnishing tobacco product to a person below the MLA, is liable on conviction in Court, to a maximum fine of $500 for the first offence and $1,000 for subsequent offences. Between January 2015 and October 2018, 18 people had been caught for such offences."
published fee benchmarks for surgical procedures at private hospitals,Prof Fatimah Lateef asked the Minister for Health how does the Ministry intend to monitor the acceptance and compliance of the recently published fee benchmarks for surgical procedures at private hospitals.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The objective of publishing fee benchmarks is to provide all stakeholders a reference on the reasonable ranges of professional fees for common surgical procedures in the private sector. The benchmarks will guide private sector healthcare providers in charging appropriately. They will also enable patients and payers to make more informed decisions.Doctors should take reference from the benchmarks in setting their fees and advising their patients. They should also be prepared to explain to patients where their charges exceed the range, such as when addressing a highly complex case or in exceptional circumstances.Today, MOH already monitors overall hospital bill sizes and doctors' charges. Where we observe charging patterns that could be of concern, we will query the healthcare providers, investigate and take follow up actions if necessary.MOH welcomes feedback on the fee benchmarks. These would help to guide future review and refinement of the benchmarks."
measures in place to assist singaporeans with no access to or unable to make online applications for nrics or passports,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what are the measures that will be put in place to assist Singaporeans with no access to or who are unable to make online applications for NRICs or passports; and (b) whether some of these measures will be retained beyond 2020 when ICA seeks to have all such applications to be made online.,"Mr K Shanmugam: For those with no access to the Internet, or who are unable to make online applications for NRICs or passports:(a) Family members and friends can apply online on their behalf.(b) Self-service kiosks are also available at the eLobby of the ICA Building, with ICA Service Ambassadors on hand to assist and guide applicants through the application process.(c) ICA can make special arrangements to assist those who are unable to make a trip to ICA due to medical reasons. For example, those who are bedridden and are required to re-register for their NRIC can request ICA to conduct the re-registration at their residence.All these measures will be available even beyond 2020."
successful first-timer applicants receiving cpf housing grants in last three years,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development what is the total number of first-timer applicants who have been successful in receiving CPF Housing Grants in the last three years according to (i) flat type, specifically BTO and resale HDB flats (ii) type of grant received (iii) quantum of grant received in multiples of $10,000 and (iv) purchase price of flat after grant, with a breakdown based on the price bands of $50,000 and below, $50,001 to $100,000 and above $100,000 in multiples of $100,000.","Mr Lawrence Wong: First-timer households purchasing a new flat from HDB enjoy a subsidised flat price, and may receive up to $80,000 in housing grants, comprising the Special CPF Housing Grant and Additional CPF Housing Grant (AHG). They may also receive up to $120,000 when purchasing a resale flat, comprising the CPF Housing Grant, AHG and Proximity Housing Grant. Between Jul 2015 to Jun 2018, about 47,700 first-timer households received CPF housing grants for their flat purchase, as detailed in Table 1 below.Housing grants are generally tiered by income so that more assistance is provided to lower-income households. Refer to Tabel 2 below for the number of first-timer households receiving CPF housing grants, by grant quantum.After factoring in housing grants, close to 80% of first-timer households paid $400,000 or less when purchasing a HDB flat, whether from HDB or the resale market (see Table 3 below)."
telecommunication outages in past three years,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) how many telecommunication outages have occurred in the past three years; and (b) what measures has the Ministry put in place to prevent the occurrences of these outages.,"Mr S Iswaran: A reliable and resilient telecommunication network is critical to our Smart Nation ambitions. That is why MCI and the Infocommunications Media Development Authority (IMDA) work with key telecommunication operators to ensure good service quality, including through IMDA’s Quality of Service frameworks.Since 2016, the number of telecommunication outages has averaged 10 outages each year. These outages were mostly due to cable cuts by contractors, or faults in the telecommunication networks.MCI and IMDA have taken measures to minimise the risk of outages. IMDA requires key telecommunication operators to regularly audit their networks to ensure that they are on par with international best practices. IMDA also educates contractors to avoid cable cuts when carrying out earthworks. IMDA also penalises telecommunication operators which contribute to outages, or which fail to restore disrupted services quickly."
suspicious mails reported to police by postal services,"Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) in the last three years, how many reports of suspicious mails stopped by postal services have been reported to the police; (b) whether there has been any person apprehended; and (c) what measures are put in place to ensure the timely reporting of such detected mails.","Mr K Shanmugam: When a suspicious mail is discovered, the SOP is for SingPost to refer it to the Police and SCDF, who will respond to assess the threat, and contain it if necessary.From 2015 to the first half of 2018, there was a single case of suspicious mail that was stopped by SingPost. In that case, which took place in 2016, a parcel containing foul-smelling liquid was detected. Police and SCDF responded, and determined that there was no threat and no malicious intent. There were consequently no arrests."
number of courses accredited by skillsfuture,"Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Education (a) to date, what is the number of courses that have been accredited by SkillsFuture; (b) what is the number of applications for accreditation that have been rejected; and (c) what are the main reasons for rejection.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: Currently, over 30,000 courses are funded by SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG). Since 2016, SSG has rejected over 4,000 other courses as they were not work skills-related."
"average and median starting monthly salaries for ite, polytechnic and university graduates","Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Manpower for ITE, polytechnic and university students who graduated in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 respectively (a) what were their average and median starting monthly salaries; (b) what were their average and median monthly salaries five years after their year of graduation; and (c) whether the Ministry will start collecting such data on post-graduation salaries, as requested in (b), if it does not already collect it on a regular basis.","Mrs Josephine Teo: Based on the annual Graduate Employment Survey (GES) conducted by the Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs), the reported median gross monthly starting salaries of ITE, Polytechnic and Autonomous University (AU) graduates in full-time permanent employment from 2008 to 2012 are given in Table 1.The GES does not track graduates’ salaries by cohort five years after their graduation. However, the median gross monthly income of full-time employed residents is available from MOM’s Comprehensive Labour Force Survey (CLFS). The majority of fresh graduates from IHLs would be in their mid- to late-20s five years after leaving school. Table 2 shows the median gross monthly income from 2013 to 2017 of full-time employed residents aged 25 to 29 – those with post-secondary non-tertiary qualifications (i.e. ITE or equivalent), diploma and professional qualifications (i.e. polytechnic or equivalent) and degree qualifications.To give us more insights into their employment and income, MOM and MOE are exploring tracking graduates’ salaries by cohort over a longer period of time."
proposal to mark examination scripts electronically,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Education with regard to the proposal to mark exam scripts electronically (a) whether the time saved from having to count physical scripts in the current system be well compensated by the need to scan and digitize the scripts in the new system; and (b) what are the identified risks of an electronic and digital system for the marking of scripts and how can they be managed.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: The Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB) has conducted a pilot trial on the scanning and digitisation of a sample of 2017 national examination answer scripts. The trial also included the marking of these digitalised scripts online. SEAB has received positive feedback from markers, including improved administrative efficiency.Examination boards in the UK and Hong Kong have been conducting electronic marking for some years. The known benefits include reduced effort from administrative processes and physical movement of scripts, improved quality in marking and better anonymity of scripts.Due to the large number of subjects offered at the Singapore-Cambridge GCE-Level examinations and the high volume of scripts handled each year, changes to the examination processes have to be carefully planned and considered.  It involves trialling to determine the required changes to the format of the answer booklet, adequate investment in IT infrastructure and devices and training of markers. SEAB will also have to ensure that the integrity of the national examinations and timing for the release of the examination results are upheld."
percentage of students living in hdb flats under public rental scheme,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Education for each year in the past five years (a) what is the percentage of students living in HDB flats under the public rental scheme; and (b) what is the average and median household income of students entering the (i) Normal (Technical) (ii) Normal (Academic) and (iii) Express streams, respectively.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: Over the last five years, approximately 2-3% of our students were living in HDB flats under the public rental scheme. MOE does not collect data on household income of students."
decline in total fertility rate,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Prime Minister with regard to our total fertility rate (TFR) (a) whether it is a concern that the figure has fallen to 1.16 in 2017; (b) whether the Government's pronatalist policies have been working; and (c) what further measures are necessary or are being considered by the Government to arrest the decline in TFR and to raise it in the long term.,"Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): The Government takes the issue of our low total fertility rate (TFR) seriously. While marriage and parenthood are ultimately personal decisions, a persistently low TFR can have far-reaching implications on our economy and our society. The decline in our TFR in recent years is in part due to a demographic shift. A relatively large cohort of young Singaporeans, many of whom are children of “baby boomers”, are just entering the peak childbearing ages of 25-39. Many of these “echo baby boomers” are not yet married or have not yet started having children. This is consistent with our survey results, which show that while the vast majority of young Singaporeans want to marry and have children, they often have other life goals as well. Some decide to delay marriage and parenthood, in order to fulfil other aspirations like establishing a career or travelling the world first.1 Whether or not they eventually marry or have children will have a significant impact on our TFR. Therefore, we must continue to support young Singaporeans and families to achieve their marriage and parenthood aspirations. In formulating our policies, we have studied the experiences of different countries (including the United Kingdom (UK), Germany, France, Denmark and East Asian countries such as South Korea). The elements that have made a real difference in raising birth rates include: (a) support for work-life through adequate parental leave, childcare and flexible work arrangements; (b) societal norms that embrace children and families, and encourage shared parental responsibility in raising children; and (c) support to defray the costs of raising children. Singapore’s marriage and parenthood policies aim to provide support in similar areas. We have invested significant resources and progressively enhanced the Marriage and Parenthood (M&P) Package over the past 17 years to provide support at each stage of the marriage and parenthood journey. To enable parents to better manage their work and family responsibilities, we have enhanced parental leave measures and strengthened support for childcare and flexible work arrangements:(a)  On parental leave, today, working couples can take up to 20 weeks of paid parental leave and two weeks of unpaid leave in their child’s first year.(b)  On childcare, the Government is committed to ensuring that every parent who wants a preschool place for their child will be able to have one, to give parents peace of mind that their children are well taken care of. ECDA has been steadily enhancing the provision of affordable and quality infant and childcare, with 40,000 more places to be added in the next five years. ECDA is also reviewing the preschool subsidy framework to improve affordability for parents.(c)  We also encourage companies to adopt family-friendly practices such as flexible work arrangements and have launched the enhanced Work-Life Grant earlier this year, as well as a Tripartite Standard on Flexible Work Arrangements in 2017, to support companies in doing so. To foster a stronger culture of shared parental responsibility, we have improved leave support for fathers to play a more active role in caring for their children. Last year, we made the second week of Paternity Leave mandatory, and increased Shared Parental Leave from one to four weeks. In total, fathers can take up to eight weeks of leave in the child’s first year.  We have also enhanced our policies to address concerns about costs of raising children. From the Baby Bonus Cash Gift, Child Development Account (CDA) and MediSave Grant for Newborns, parents can receive up to $18,000 per child for the first and second child, $26,000 per child for the third and fourth child, and $32,000 per child for the fifth and subsequent child. We also understand that many couples aspire to own their homes before they start a family. HDB has worked to provide couples with faster access to housing. Last week, it launched the first batch of 1,100 Build-To-Order (BTO) flats with shorter waiting times of two to three years from point of application. Another batch of 2,000 such flats will be launched in 2019. HDB has also introduced a new flexibility earlier this year to allow deferment of income assessment for housing loans and grants till before keys collection, for young couples who are studying or, in the case of the male, serving National Service.Together with our heavily subsidised education, public housing, and healthcare systems, these measures in our M&P Package seek to provide strong support for those who decide to marry and have children. We will continue to study ways to better strengthen this support. We are mindful that no silver bullet or single policy intervention alone will boost birth rates. As the experiences of other East Asian societies (e.g. South Korea) have shown, encouraging couples to have children requires more than a package of support measures. For a decisive increase in our TFR over the longer term, mindset shifts among couples and the support of the whole of society are critical. We must continue to encourage young Singaporeans not just to value but to prioritise marriage and parenthood as important life goals.  As employers and co-workers, we can foster more progressive workplace cultures where employees, including young parents with caregiving needs, are supported in managing their work and family responsibilities. As a community, we can extend a helping hand or word of encouragement to young Singaporeans as they navigate through their marriage and parenthood journey. It is with such collective efforts from the whole of society that we can build a more family-friendly environment where marriage and parenthood are Achievable, Enjoyable and Celebrated."
regulations on e-money float and electronic payments,"Mr Desmond Choo asked the Prime Minister (a) how do Singapore's regulations on e-money float compare to those of the major global financial centers; (b) what is the progress on the consultation on ""user protection measures in electronic payments""; and (c) how will the Ministry protect consumer interests while ensuring Singapore's competitiveness as an e-payments processing hub.","Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): Singaporeans have a growing range of e-payment options available to them. Besides PayNow, debit cards and credit cards, stored value facilities in the form of e-wallets are gaining popularity.Currently, MAS requires entities who hold a stored value float in excess of S$30 million in these stored value facilities to safeguard the float with a bank licensed by MAS.1Consumers will enjoy better protection of their funds held in stored value under the Payment Services Bill (“PSB”) that is being introduced in Parliament today. It contains two key enhancements.First, more types of stored value, or e-money, will be protected under the PSB. E-money will include not just pre-payment for goods and services such as value stored in transport cards, but also any monetary value that is held for future payment transfers between individuals. This means that the value held in e-wallets that people use to pay merchants or pay each other will also be protected in future.Second, the threshold of e-money that will be protected under the PSB will be lowered from S$30 million to S$5 million. This means that any e-money held by a payment institution will be wholly safeguarded if the average daily float exceeds S$5 million.2 If the average daily float does not exceed S$5 million, the safeguarding measures will not apply, provided the payment institution makes appropriate disclosures to consumers.We have sought to protect consumer interests while encouraging innovation in e-payments and ensuring Singapore’s competitiveness as a payment services hub. This requires that our regulations are proportionate to the risks. To give payment institutions adequate flexibility, MAS will expand the options for safeguarding measures available to Major Payment Institutions, beyond the current requirement of a bank guarantee. Under the PSB, a guarantee given by a prescribed financial institution or segregation of customer monies in a bank account will be recognised as alternative safeguarding measures.3 These two key enhancements on the scope of e-money and options for safeguarding measures are similar to those in Australia, Hong Kong, and the United Kingdom.To complement the measures in the PSB and existing regulations on banking services, MAS has issued the E-Payments User Protection Guidelines (the “Guidelines”). The Guidelines essentially aim to enhance consumer confidence in e-payments. Financial institutions and e-payment users can look to the Guidelines for (a) their respective responsibilities for ensuring secure e-payment transactions; (b) how liability for unauthorised transactions ought to be apportioned; and (c) simplified error resolution processes when a user sends money to the wrong recipient. The Guidelines were finalised in September after MAS’ public consultation earlier this year. They will take effect in January next year.MAS will continue to engage both the industry and the public as the e-payments landscape evolves, so that we provide assurance to users without holding back innovations that enhance competition and efficiency in payment services."
extra checks on reliability of vehicles selected for use as public transport,"Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for Transport in light of a recent recall of cars over a fault that can increase crash risks (a) whether LTA conducts extra checks on the reliability of vehicles selected for use on the roads, especially for taxis and private hire vehicles; and (b) beyond emission standards, what other checks are conducted on vehicles used for public transport at the point of registration and subsequent use on the roads.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The Land Transport Authority (LTA) requires new vehicle types to be put through a robust type approval regime to ensure that they comply with internationally recognised vehicle safety standards, before they can be allowed for use on our roads. LTA also requires all in-use vehicles to be inspected regularly at LTA-authorised Inspection Centres to ensure that they are roadworthy. These inspections cover key vehicle components and systems, such as brakes, steering, tyres and exhaust systems. Besides these regular inspections, LTA and the Traffic Police also call up vehicles for ad-hoc inspections to evaluate their safety and roadworthiness. Vehicles which fail these inspections are not allowed to be used on our roads. Taxis, buses and heavy vehicles are generally subject to more stringent requirements. For example, only new vehicles are allowed to be registered as taxis, and LTA has stringent safety standards when purchasing new public buses. Taxis and public buses are also required to go for vehicular inspections more frequently, and are subject to statutory lifespans of 8 and 17 years respectively. Separately, when a vehicle model is recalled, LTA requires motor dealers and importers to notify LTA and affected vehicle owners promptly, and arrange with owners to rectify the affected vehicles. It is an offence for motor dealers and importers to not comply with this requirement. LTA’s electronic Vehicle Recall System also allows vehicle owners to check if their vehicles are affected by the recall, as well as the progress of rectification works."
pipeline of skilled local car mechanics to support hybrid/electric and autonomous vehicles using automation technology,"Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for Transport in view of the greater adoption of hybrid/electric and autonomous vehicles using automation technology (a) whether Singapore has enough skilled local car mechanics in the pipeline; (b) whether the Ministry will be mapping the skill requirements, job prospects, salary and career progression pathways to upskill our car mechanics; and (c) whether the major employers of car mechanics in Singapore have these initiatives in place.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: There are about 15,000 car mechanics in the motor workshop industry. The Singapore Motor Workshop Association (SMWA) is leading industry efforts to upskill car mechanics in view of the greater adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid vehicles. SMWA is planning to establish a training academy which will offer centralised skills training for mechanics. This will ensure that car mechanics in Singapore continue to have relevant skills in light of changing technologies. SMWA is also planning to enhance local EV diagnostic, repair and maintenance capabilities. This will be achieved through hosting German specialists to train local mechanics, and organising overseas attachment programmes for more advanced training. Workforce Singapore will be providing funding support for this initiative under the Capability Transfer Programme. Autonomous Vehicle (AV) technology is nascent and mainstream adoption of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is still some time away. In the meantime, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) is conducting trials to better understand AV technology and determine the eventual concept of operations for deployment in Singapore. These trials will provide a sense of the scale and type of repair and maintenance services required to inform our longer-term manpower development plans."
measures to reduce single-use plastics in national day parade 2019,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Defence (a) what measures are being taken to reduce single-use plastics in National Day Parade (NDP) 2019; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider providing only reusable items with minimal packaging in the NDP 2019 fun pack.,"Dr Ng Eng Hen: Since 2002, the NDP Executive Committee (EXCO) has worked closely with the National Environment Agency (NEA) to organise a clean and sustainable NDP. In doing so, the EXCO takes into account the varying needs of attendees and participants, including the young and elderly as well as the need for prudent spending. The general direction is to use reusables, when available and cost-effective. For next year’s NDP, paper instead of plastic Bento boxes will be used to cater meals for our NDP participants and each fun pack will contain one larger bottled water, instead of the usual two. While it is not feasible to have only reusable items with minimal packaging for the fun pack, NDP EXCO will work with NEA to establish collection points to encourage NDP spectators to return unused items, especially Ponchos (for wet weather) from the fun pack."
poor re-surfacing of roads after completion of cable/pipe installation works,"Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for Transport whether LTA supervises the resurfacing of roads each time contractors have dug holes in the roads to install wires, cables and pipes and, if so, what is the reason for poor re-surfacing of the roads after the works are completed.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: All contractors are required to reinstate roads after their works, based on standards stipulated in LTA’s Code of Practice for Works on Public Streets. These standards include the International Roughness Index which is an international standard that measures the riding quality of roads. However, LTA has observed through its regular audit checks and public feedback, cases where contractors did not carry out these reinstatement works in accordance to LTA’s requirements. In such instances, LTA will enforce against these contractors and require them to rectify their reinstatement works. These errant contractors will also be fined up to $500 per infringement and penalised with demerit points. Contractors who chalk up more than 200 demerit points a month will be suspended from carrying out any new works. Members of the public can call LTA’s hotline to report instances of poorly resurfaced roads."
civil service salary structure review,Mr Leon Perera asked the Prime Minister (a) how often does the Public Service Division review the salary structure of the Civil Service; (b) when was the last review conducted; and (c) what are the salary scales for each of the Management Executive pay grades from 2010 to 2017.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing (for the Prime Minister): The Civil Service’s pay philosophy is to keep pace with, but not lead the market. We will check that our salaries remain market competitive every year, but only adjust salaries where necessary. We have not made any major adjustments to salaries in the last few years. The last substantive change to the Management Executive Scheme (MXS) was in 2015, where MXS was extended to create a single career scheme for both degree and non-degree holders. Officers with the same potential and performance would be given the same opportunities for advancement and career development, regardless of their academic background.New officers in Executive roles on the MXS are generally paid a monthly salary starting from $3,100. The monthly salary for senior management Superscale officers, comprising around 1.9% of the Civil Service, starts from around $11,000. "
take-up rate for home protection scheme,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the current take-up rate for the Home Protection Scheme (HPS); (b) whether it can be made compulsory for all HDB home owners with outstanding housing loans to take up HPS regardless of whether they are using their CPF to service the loans; and (c) what is the Ministry doing to create more awareness about the importance of HPS and similar schemes.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: About 80% of HDB flat buyers in 2017 used CPF monies to service their loans.  These buyers are covered under CPF Board’s policy which mandates compulsory take-up of the Home Protection Scheme (HPS) for those who use CPF monies to repay any instalment of a housing loan taken to buy an HDB flat.  An additional 12% of recent flat buyers used cash to service their loans and took up HPS voluntarily.  Effectively this means that around 92% of recent HDB flat buyers with outstanding loans are covered under the HPS policy, or have voluntarily taken up HPS.  Besides HPS, some home buyers may have purchased mortgage-reducing insurance (MRI) products from the private sector.  We do not have detailed records of such purchases, but many commercial banks offer such MRI products as part of their loan financing package to home buyers.  So the overall insurance coverage may well be higher. HDB will continue to work with the CPF Board to further encourage voluntary take-up of HPS.  For example, besides conducting regular informational talks and distributing HPS booklets to home buyers, HDB will also explain to all flat buyers the benefits and coverage of HPS at the point of flat purchase.  We will continue to monitor the situation and assess whether to implement further measures if the need arises."
status of backlog of unsuccessful applications for 2-room bto flats,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the status of the backlog of unsuccessful applications for two-room BTO flats; (b) how many of these applicants are singles; (c) how many more two-room BTO flats will be available in the next three years; and (d) how does the Ministry plan to increase the supply of two-room BTO flats.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: From 2015 to 2017, the proportion of applicants who were invited to book a 2-room Flexi flat increased from 52% to 84%.For singles, their application rate has come down steadily from 8.5 in 2015 to 4.4 for the BTO launches in 2018 so far. This improvement was made possible through HDB’s efforts to increase the supply of 2-room Flexi flats in non-mature estates, from 320 in 2012 to an average of about 4,000 per year from 2014. HDB will continue to offer this same level of flat supply in 2018. Beyond that, HDB will continue to fine-tune its 2-room Flexi flats supply to meet the demand from singles.Besides buying a flat from HDB, singles can consider the option of buying a resale flat on the open market. The wide range of resale flats available, and housing grants totalling up to $60,000 for eligible buyers, will help singles to find a suitable flat within their budget. "
review of situation of landed eastwood estate with cracks and structural issues probably caused to public works,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry can review the situation facing a number of residents in the landed Eastwood estate off Bedok Road who have seen cracks and structural issues appearing at around the same time, so as to provide them with a single point of contact with a lead agency to assess the issues and advise them, given that the problems could have been caused by works done by different agencies in the vicinity such as PUB's canal-widening project and LTA's MRT tunnelling.","Mr Lawrence Wong: With regard to the situation in Eastwood estate, we understand that affected residents have contacted PUB and LTA, and that the agencies have followed up and responded accordingly. For cases where structural safety concerns were raised, a Professional Engineer has inspected the buildings and found them to be structurally safe. Where there are potential building structural safety issues, members of the public and building owners can contact the Building and Construction Authority (BCA).  BCA will investigate the feedback, consult relevant agencies, and respond accordingly.  BCA can also help to facilitate discussions between the owners and project parties to resolve issues, as needed."
shorter period of closure for repairs and renovation of hawker centres,Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether NEA can consider a shorter period of closure for the repairs and renovation carried out for hawker centres so that the hawkers may have better options to continue their operations.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Cyclical repairs and redecoration (R&R) works are carried out at hawker centres by the respective Town Councils or the National Environment Agency (NEA) every five to seven years. This ensures that hawker centres are well-maintained, to provide patrons and hawkers with a pleasant and hygienic cooking and dining environment.R&R works are typically completed within two to three months, depending on the scope of works and size of the hawker centre. In planning for such works, NEA will seek feedback from the Hawkers Association and stallholders on the preferred closure periods, so that stallholders have ample advance notice and can make their plans accordingly. We also work with contractors to plan for the shortest possible closure period to enable stallholders to resume their businesses as soon as possible."
number of sellers of residential properties who paid seller stamp duty year on year since implementation,"Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for National Development (a) what has been the number of sellers of residential properties who paid Seller Stamp Duty (SSD) year on year since SSD was implemented; (b) of these numbers, how many of them are Singaporeans who own only one residential property; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider exempting Singaporeans who own only one residential property from SSD.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Since the Seller’s Stamp Duty (SSD) was implemented in 2010, only about 5% of all transactions in the secondary market, or approximately 5,000 transactions, were liable for SSD. Out of these, approximately 40%, or 2,000 transactions, involved sale by Singaporeans owning only one residential property. The SSD is intended to discourage short-term holding of residential properties, and is part of the Government’s measures to ensure a stable and sustainable property market. This principle applies to all sellers of property, regardless of the number of properties they own at the point of sale."
income of foreign spouse of singaporeans in hdb housing loan or grant applications,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for National Development whether the income of a foreign spouse who is married to a Singaporean is taken into consideration by HDB in deciding the quantum of housing loan or grant that the applicant would be eligible for.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Housing grants are means-tested, and pegged to the monthly household income of all working members of the household. In particular, the grant quantum for the Additional CPF Housing Grant and Special CPF Housing Grant is tiered based on monthly household income, while the quantum for the CPF Housing Grant is tiered by flat type.  With regard to housing loan, HDB determines the loan quantum based on the flat owners’ income as they are ones who are borrowing and need to service the mortgage. Nevertheless, HDB exercises flexibility and considers appeals to use the occupiers’ income for the computation of the loan amount on a case-by-case basis."
median and average monthly income of single unwed parents,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Social and Family Development in each of the past five years, what is the median and average monthly income of single unwed parents (i) below 35 years old (ii) between 35 and 36 years old and (iii) 36 years old and above, respectively.","Mr Desmond Lee: The median and average monthly income for citizen mothers with non-marital births is in the table below. These figures are derived by dividing their annual income by 12. For those aged below 35 years old, it is likely that quite a number may be working in part-time jobs or only for a few months of the year, contributing to their lower monthly income."
outreach and support for people with physical and other disabilities in singapore,"Ms Yip Pin Xiu asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what is the current total number of people with physical disabilities, intellectual disabilities, and those who are blind or deaf in Singapore; and (b) whether there has been consideration to share the particulars of this group of people, while maintaining a high level of privacy, to VWOs or organisations that can help with outreach and provide support to this targeted group of people.","Mr Desmond Lee: The prevalence rate of Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) in Singapore is as follows:Persons with sensory (blindness and deafness) and physical disabilities constitute half of the disability group. The other half comprises those with Intellectual Disabilities, Autistic Spectrum Disorder and other types of disabilities.4 As part of efforts to better support PwDs, the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) is working with the Department of Statistics (DOS) to include disability-related questions in the upcoming population census to be conducted in 2020. Data collected from the census will enable government agencies to better plan services and programmes for different groups of PwDs. On the issue of data sharing, we will look into sharing appropriate data with voluntary welfare organisations and other help organisations when the census data is available. However, sharing of personal information with non-governmental organisations will require consent, so as to protect the privacy of individuals."
riot at singapore boys’ home,"Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Social and Family Development with regard to the riot at the Singapore Boys' Home (a) what are the measures and precautions in place to detect, pre-empt and deter such incidences from occurring again; (b) what are the standard operating procedures and protocols when mass disturbances occur; and (c) what is the number of disturbances that occurred over the last five years in the Home.","Mr Desmond Lee: Close coordination between MSF and MHA is key to ensuring safety and security within the Singapore Boys’ Home (SBH). There were three incidents of mass disturbance where resources from the Singapore Police Force (SPF) were activated in the last five years. MSF works closely with the Home Team departments to learn from these incidents in order to strengthen our standard operating procedures and activation protocols.Early prevention and intervention is the first line of defence. MSF staff is trained to identify early signs of conflict. Youth management plans are developed to address tensions and to support the youths with counselling or psychological treatment where necessary. This allows the Home to manage conflicts before they escalate.If an incident of mass disturbance were to happen, the MSF officers have been trained in a series of protocols, which include activating reinforcements, de-escalating the conflict, and physically separating residents to ensure their safety. The SPF is also activated as part of the protocol to pre-empt further escalations.Post-incident, there are after-action reviews so that we can continue to improve the incident management and rehabilitation approach. Where necessary, the SPF will undertake investigations."
singaporeans aged 65 and above with lasting power of attorney,"Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) to date, how many Singaporeans aged 65 and above have made their Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA); and (b) how can the Government better reach out to this group of senior citizens to do an LPA, especially with mental distress being on the rise.","Mr Desmond Lee: Currently, out of 51,000 Lasting Powers of Attorney (LPAs) made, 23,000 were made by Singaporeans aged 65 and above.The Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) has been working closely with various organisations to raise awareness on the importance of making an LPA among seniors. These include conducting talks and disseminating LPA collaterals at community touch points such as Community Centres, public libraries and Senior Activity Centres. Going forward, we will work with Silver Generation Office to promote awareness of LPA. We have also promoted the LPA through radio. We will continue to tap on mass media and social media to reach out to more seniors.For seniors with no family support, the newly launched Professional Deputies and Donees scheme allows them to appoint registered professionals such as lawyers, accountants and medical professionals as their donees in an LPA.The application fee waiver for Singapore Citizens making an LPA Form 1 has been extended to 31 August 2020 and we encourage more seniors to make their LPAs."
cost to make a lasting power of attorney,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what is the average cost that Singaporeans have to pay a certificate issuer to make a Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA); and (b) whether the Ministry will consider expanding the categories of persons eligible to act as LPA certificate issuers.,"Mr Desmond Lee: Three groups of professionals can act as Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) certificate issuers, namely, doctors accredited by the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG), lawyers or registered psychiatrists.  Most members of the public applying for LPAs use doctors and lawyers, rather than psychiatrists. The 10 most visited accredited medical practitioners charge fees ranging from $25 to $80, with most charging $50 for the LPA certificate issuing fee. The 10 most visited lawyers charge fees ranging from $80 to $400, with most charging $150. There are also not-for-profit organisations that offer subsidised rates to the lower income and the elderly. Members of the public can refer to OPG’s website at www.bit.ly/LPACertIssuers for the lists of 10 most visited certificate issuers among doctors and lawyers, and not-for-profit organisations. Currently, there are approximately 6,200 certificate issuers catering to Singaporeans with different needs and preferences. As demand for certificate issuers is adequately met, there are no plans to expand the categories of LPA certificate issuers."
applications for work injury compensation (workers’ fund),Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Manpower in respect of the Work Injury Compensation (Workers' Fund) (a) how many applications has the Ministry received so far; (b) how many workers have benefitted from the fund and its payouts since its introduction; and (c) whether there is any plan to increase the awareness of this fund.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: The Workers’ Fund provides financial help to employees or their dependents who have not been compensated by their employers in the event of a work injury. Since 2005, when the earliest records were available, 51 applications have been received and about $1 million has been paid out in 34 cases where employees and their families were either in financial difficulty or victims of long-drawn occupational diseases.Prior to 2017, the Workers’ Fund was targeted at helping those who were in financial hardship. The eligibility criteria were broadened in 2017 to provide assistance to employees and their families regardless of their financial situation. To ensure that those affected are aware of the Workers’ Fund, MOM would inform employees or their dependents who are eligible for work injury compensation but are not compensated to apply for assistance under the Fund."
update on government’s assessment on raising cut-off age for definition of young person in children and young persons act,"Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for Social and Family Development whether he can provide an update on the Government's assessment as to whether to raise the cut-off age for the definition of ""young person"" in the Children and Young Persons Act from 16 years to 18 years, for consistency with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child which Singapore has acceded to.","Mr Desmond Lee:  As stated in Singapore’s combined 4th and 5th periodic report submitted in Nov 2017 to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, MSF is assessing, as part of its review of the Children and Young Persons Act (CYPA), the timing to include young persons from 16 to 18 years of age who may require care or protection.MSF has been working closely with our partners on the CYPA review. We will announce details of this review in due course."
hawker centres operating 24 hours a day,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) how many hawker centres are currently operating 24 hours a day; and (b) in each of the hawker centres which are currently operating 24 hours a day, what is the percentage of the stalls which are actually operating 24 hours a day over the total number of stalls in the respective hawker centres.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Of the 114 hawker centres managed by the National Environment Agency (NEA) and NEA-appointed operators, only the hawker centre at Our Tampines Hub (OTH) operates 24 hours a day. On average, about 20% of its 42 stalls operate 24 hours a day. This was in response to requests from the community for a 24-hour hawker centre. But as the demand from patrons has not materialised, both hawkers and the operator are recalibrating the arrangement."
update on hand foot mouth disease infections,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the number of Hand Foot Mouth Disease infections are on the uptrend; and (b) whether current efforts to break their transmission need to be improved.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The reported cases of Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease (HFMD) fluctuates from year to year, as shown in the table below.MOH works closely with the Ministry of Education (MOE), Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) and People’s Association (PA) to educate and assist pre-schools to curb and control the spread of HFMD. We provide guidance on personal and environmental hygiene, and inspect pre-schools with large clusters to help them identify gaps.  We also provide infection control guidelines to all pre-schools, and work with them to remind parents to play their part by keeping their children home to rest if their children have symptoms of HFMD such as fever, mouth ulcers and rashes on the palms, soles or buttocks.During the peak months this year - March to May and July to Aug – we reminded pre-schools to be more vigilant in screening children with HFMD symptoms, and ensure high personal and environmental hygiene standards. ECDA also stepped up on health visits to pre-schools with ongoing transmission.MOH will continue to regularly review our policies and response measures with respect to the control of HFMD transmission."
foreign domestic workers borrowing from legal and illegal moneylenders,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Law (a) in the past 10 years, how many reports have been lodged by residents that their foreign domestic workers have borrowed from legal and illegal moneylenders respectively; (b) how many such of residents became the victims of harassment from loan sharks or legal money collectors respectively; and (c) whether there are plans to ban borrowings by foreign domestic workers from legal moneylenders.","Mr K Shanmugam: The Registry of Moneylenders received no public feedback on foreign domestic workers (FDWs) borrowing from licensed moneylenders prior to 2017. The Registry received 1 case of feedback in 2017 and 38 cases of feedback in the first half of 2018. This reflects an increase in the number of foreign domestic workers who borrowed from licensed moneylenders from 1,500 in 2016, to 12,000 in 2017, and to 28,000 in the first half of 2018.The Police have observed more foreigners residing in Singapore, including foreign domestic workers, borrowing from unlicensed moneylenders. The Police have also seen an increase in reports of harassment from unlicensed moneylenders arising from foreign domestic workers who took loans or acted as guarantors. From 2008 to 2012, the Police registered no such reports, while 2013 to September 2018 saw about 460 of such reports. Any employer who is harassed by unlicensed moneylenders should report such activities to the Police. The Police adopt a tough enforcement stance against unlicensed moneylenders and anyone who assists them in perpetuating illicit activities. The Police and the Attorney General’s Chambers have prosecuted errant debt collectors who have violated the law, and will continue to take strong enforcement action against such conduct. Enhancing Borrower Protections There are currently several measures to protect all individuals who borrow from licensed moneylenders. For example, the Moneylenders Rules permit a licensed moneylender to charge only the following for each loan:(a)    An upfront administrative fee of up to 10%;(b)    Interest of up to 4% per month;(c)    Late interest of up to 4% per month; and(d)    Late fees of up to $60 per month.The Registrar of Moneylenders have issued Directions to regulate moneylenders’ activities. In particular, moneylenders are prohibited from advertising their loans to members of the public via mobile text messages or emails. Moneylenders are also prohibited from conducting abusive practices such as repeatedly “rolling over” existing loans to charge the administrative fee multiple times even though no new credit is issued; or offering split loans so that late fees can be charged multiple times a month.In view of the recent increase in foreigners borrowing from moneylenders, on 4 October 2018, the Ministry of Law announced two measures to strengthen protections for foreign domestic workers and other foreigners residing in Singapore from the effects of over-borrowing.First, the Ministry will impose aggregate loan caps to limit the total amount that any foreigner residing in Singapore can borrow from licensed moneylenders. The caps were first announced for Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents under the Moneylenders (Amendment) Bill in January this year:(a)    Individuals earning less than $20,000 a year may borrow up to $3,000; and(b)    Individuals earning $20,000 or more a year may borrow up to six times of monthly income.Both caps will be extended to all foreigners residing in Singapore. In addition, there will be a lower cap of $1,500 for all foreigners residing in Singapore who earn less than $10,000 annually.Second, the Ministry will introduce a self-exclusion framework for all individuals who borrow from licensed moneylenders. Both Singapore residents and foreigners may apply for self-exclusion. Licensed moneylenders will be prohibited from lending to self-excluded individuals.This framework will help individuals to control their borrowing habits, and to participate in debt assistance schemes administered by voluntary welfare organisations which typically require self-exclusion.Third, on unlicensed moneylenders, the Ministry of Manpower has announced that it will take administrative actions against work pass holders who borrow from unlicensed moneylenders. When a work pass holder is found to have borrowed from unlicensed moneylenders, the Ministry of Manpower will inform the employer and revoke the work pass. The worker will then be repatriated and debarred from further employment in Singapore.The Ministry of Manpower will implement this measure against borrowing from unlicensed moneylenders in 2019, after a period of education and communication. The Ministry of Manpower will continue to step up educational efforts on money management and the risks of borrowing from moneylenders, for work pass holders and their employers.These measures will be complemented by existing support channels for work pass holders, such as voluntary welfare organisations, the Migrant Workers’ Centre, and the Centre for Domestic Employees.The Ministry of Law, together with the Ministry of Manpower and the Singapore Police Force, will continue to monitor the situation closely following the implementation of these measures, and will assess if more stringent measures are necessary."
assistance and compensation to affected family of saf training accidents,"Mr Terence Ho Wee San asked the Minister for Defence (a) in view of the recent training accidents, whether the SAF deems the current assistance and compensation as sufficient to the affected family; and (b) how will the army-wide safety timeout on training ensure the prevention of such accidents from happening again.","Dr Ng Eng Hen: MINDEF’s compensation framework tracks the amounts prescribed by the Work Injury Compensation Act (WICA) but would be generally higher in recognition of the risks borne by our servicemen during military training and operations. For deaths that result from military training or operations, the compensation amount is doubled that of WICA. On top of this, additional compensation may be granted if there are exceptional circumstances or when the serviceman had rendered service beyond the call of duty. Overall, the total compensation amounts disbursed for incidents arising from training and operations are generally two to four times that of amounts provided under the national compensation framework. The SAF also provides welfare support through grants disbursed from the SAF Benevolent Fund. These grants are used to meet the immediate needs of the families of servicemen who have passed away as well as provide financial assistance to help the serviceman’s family, depending on the family’s circumstances. Over and above the existing compensation and welfare provisions, MINDEF provides our servicemen with $150,000 of Group Term Life (GTL) and $150,000 of Group Personal Accident (GPA) insurance under the MINDEF/SAF Group Insurance Core Scheme. The premiums for these insurance are paid by MINDEF, in recognition of our servicemen’s contribution to national defence and security, and to strengthen our care for them.The Member has also asked how SAF intends to prevent further training accidents. This will be addressed in our reply to similar questions raised by MPs in this sitting."
financial crimes targeting the elderly,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Home Affairs what is being done to reduce and prevent financial crimes targeting the elderly.,"Mr K Shanmugam: There are strong punishments to deter financial crimes against the elderly, which usually involve cheating. Offenders can face a jail term of up to 10 years, and a fine. The Government is also studying ways to strengthen our laws against cheating offences. The Penal Code Review Committee has made recommendations in this area, which the Government is studying. Besides having strong punishments as deterrence, the Police have also taken steps to educate the elderly. For example, the Police work with the Residents’ Committees and grassroots volunteers to spread scam alert messages to residents, through community events like block parties, roadshows, festive events and Community Safety & Security Programmes (CSSPs). One such CSSP focusing on the elderly is the Silver Watch Group. Launched in 2013, the initiative aims to impart elderly residents with crime prevention knowledge by keeping them informed of the latest crime situation and encouraging them to share the relevant advice with their peers. The Police have also worked with banks and remittance centres to identify potential victims and advise them to exercise caution when transferring money to unknown bank accounts. To increase public awareness, the Police have also put up anti-scam advisories near to ATM and AXS machines. Members of the public who wish to seek scam-related advice can call the anti-scam helpline at 1800-722-6688, or visit www.scamalert.sg. "
traffic violations by heavy vehicle drivers,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Home Affairs with regard to the recent island-wide operation against heavy vehicle drivers (a) what are the main violations for issuing the summonses; (b) what is the trend of heavy vehicle violations in the past five years; and (c) what is the Ministry's plan to reduce these violations as heavy vehicles can potentially cause greater damage and loss of life on the roads.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The most common traffic violations by heavy vehicle drivers are speeding and red-light running. Over the past five years, from 2013 to 2017, traffic violations committed by heavy vehicle drivers increased by an annualised rate of 6.7%. Traffic Police (TP) has been conducting regular road safety talks and dialogues with heavy vehicle owners and drivers. At these events, TP shares the common causes of heavy vehicle accidents, and encourages drivers to adopt good road safety practices. We will also continue to encourage drivers to refresh their driving skills. For example, SkillsFuture Singapore provides grants for drivers to attend MOM-approved training programmes, such as the “Crash Prevention Course” conducted by the Automobile Association of Singapore Academy. TP posts its road-safety tips for heavy vehicle drivers on its online learning portal. TP and MOM are working with partners to test technological solutions that can foster safer driving. Examples include devices that can alert owners and drivers to risky behaviour such as speeding, tail-gating and sudden braking. Should these solutions prove to be effective, we will look into ways to encourage wide adoption."
sign-ups as dementia friends through dementia friends mobile app,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Health (a) to date, how many people have signed up as Dementia Friends through the Dementia Friends mobile app; and (b) whether the app should be used by concerned members of the wider public who are not specifically trained to help persons with dementia and their families.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Dementia Friends mobile app was developed as part of the Dementia-Friendly Singapore initiative, and was officially launched on 25 October 2018. As at end October 2018, over 2,000 people have signed up as Dementia Friends through the Dementia Friends mobile app. The mobile app was designed for both caregivers of persons with dementia, as well as the wider general public.  It allows users to access information about dementia and the available support services, receive updates on upcoming events on caregiving, and most importantly, enlist the help of the community to locate loved ones who might be lost. When persons with dementia are lost, caregivers can use the mobile app to activate the network of Dementia Friends.  These Dementia Friends who are members of the public would then receive a notification from the mobile app to help keep a look out for the lost persons.  Go-to Points are listed in the mobile app, so that the persons who are lost can be brought to the nearest Go-to Point by nearby Dementia Friends to be reunited with their caregivers. We hope that the Dementia Friends mobile app can serve to mobilise community resources to support and respond to caregivers’ needs.  Members of the public are encouraged to download this mobile app and sign up as a Dementia Friend, and to also share this useful resource with relatives and friends, whether or not they are specifically trained."
measures to prevent traffic accidents at causeway,"Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) in the past one year, how many accidents involving motorcycles, lorries and trailers have occurred on the Causeway; and (b) whether the Ministry is reviewing the need to introduce new measures to prevent traffic accidents at the Causeway.","Mr K Shanmugam: Since the beginning of this year, there were nine traffic accidents on the Causeway within Singapore’s jurisdiction, that resulted in injuries or fatalities. Eight of these involved motorcycles, and one of these eight also involved a lorry and a trailer.Traffic Police (“TP”) has put up signs at both checkpoints to remind all motorists entering Singapore to abide by our traffic laws and to drive safely. TP also works closely with the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (“ICA”) to ensure safe traffic flows. For example, during periods of high traffic, Woodlands Checkpoint deploys special support teams to augment the officers already on the ground, to manage traffic.The Land Transport Authority (“LTA”) has also put in place safety infrastructure such as clearly-demarcated lanes and arrow markings to guide motorists on the Causeway and the Second Link.We will continue to monitor the situation and implement additional road safety measures if necessary."
revocation by saf’s in-camp medical officers of medical leave issued by private gps to full-time national servicemen,"Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for Defence (a) in the last three years, how many cases of Full-Time National Servicemen's medical leave issued by private GPs have been revoked by SAF's in-camp medical officers; (b) what are the main reasons for the revocations; and (c) what are the processes involved prior to the in-camp medical officer's revocation of the medical leave.","Dr Ng Eng Hen: Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) medical officers do not revoke medical certificates (MCs) issued by external medical practitioners. Unit medical officers may, however, conduct a clinical review of the SAF personnel’s medical condition and propose an amendment to the MC.To effect such an amendment, the medical officer either discusses the case with the medical practitioner who issued the original MC, or refers the SAF personnel to a relevant specialist who can advise on the proposed amendment. An amendment could include an adjustment to the duration of the MC, or exemption from specific activities. Personnel may at any point see the unit medical officer for a further clinical review. Instances of amendments to MCs are infrequent in the SAF."
replacement of analogue tv signal systems with digital tv starter kit and extension of its redemption programme,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for Communications and Information whether IMDA will render its service to replace analogue television signal systems with the Digital TV Starter Kit at senior citizen corners located at HDB void decks.,19 Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) whether the Digital TV Starter Kit (DSK) redemption programme can be extended to all households including those in private estates; and (b) whether the DSK redemption can be given to households who may have an existing cable TV subscription but who may terminate the subscription at a later stage.Mr S Iswaran: All Singaporean HDB households who do not subscribe to Pay TV are eligible for the Digital TV Starter Kit (DSK). Singaporean HDB households who terminate their Pay TV subscriptions before analogue signals are switched off on 1 Jan 2019 are similarly eligible for the DSK.Singaporean households in private estates with financial difficulties can appeal to the Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA) for the DSK. The managing agents for public areas such as senior citizen corners at void decks can purchase the necessary Digital TV equipment from major retailers and Mediacorp’s partners.
review of effectiveness of mental health education in schools,"Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Education (a) whether there has been a review of the effectiveness of mental health education in schools and, if so, what is the outcome of the review; and (b) whether there are any plans to expand mental health education and support for young adults in institutions of higher learning in addition to existing support structures in schools and non-profit organisations.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: MOE monitors the well-being of our students, and is committed to ensuring that students who require support receive the assistance they need. There is a mental health programme in place. In schools, mental health education has been enhanced through social-emotional learning in the Character and Citizenship curriculum. This is to raise awareness of mental illnesses, encourage help-seeking behaviour, reduce stigmatisation, and also to help students to be able to identify friends who may be suffering from it.Schools have also increased the number of mental health programmes, such as talks and exhibitions which foster greater awareness of mental health issues. Every school is now resourced with at least 1 counsellor whose responsibility include supporting students in distress. Similarly, our Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) are doing more. Students are equipped with basic knowledge of mental wellness through curricular and co-curricular programmes. For example, students in Republic Polytechnic and the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) attend compulsory LifeSkills modules which focus on promoting social-emotional well-being and strategies on stress management. Schools and IHLs also have put in place increased measures for early detection and intervention. This includes emergency hotlines and counsellors to provide support for students. Peer supporters are also trained in active listening skills, identification of distress signs, and to refer distressed peers to trusted adults.In addition, Health Promotion Board provides mental health awareness briefings and resources for teachers and school counsellors annually. These enhance their understanding of mental health issues, its impact on students as well as provide strategies on how to support students better."
work permit holders hired under direct r1 pathway or market-based skills recognition framework,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Manpower (a) in the last three years, how many work permit holders are hired under the Direct R1 Pathway or Market-Based Skills Recognition Framework; (b) how does the Ministry verify that workers hired under the two schemes are paid at least the minimum salary of $1,600; (c) how many employers have been charged for false salary declarations relating to these schemes; and (d) whether the Ministry will consider requiring work permit holders on these schemes to be paid electronically to verify that they are paid the minimum salary as is done for S-Pass holders.","Mrs Josephine Teo: As at the end of 2017, there were 91,700 Work Permit Holders granted R1 (Skilled) status on account of their skills or years of experience, and meeting a minimum salary criterion.As part of the application for or renewal of Work Permits, employers are required to declare that the indicated salary is true, and they are warned that failure to pay the declared salary or providing false information is an offence. MOM conducts random inspections to detect non-compliance. In addition, when foreign workers lodge complaints of underpayment of salary or kickbacks, MOM also investigates the employer for making a false declaration in their application.In 2017, 61 employers were investigated for falsely declaring the salary in a Work Permit application involving the R1 qualifying routes raised by the Member. Of these, 18 employers were either prosecuted or issued with an Administrative Financial Penalty. Their work pass privileges were also suspended.All employers are already required by law to pay their foreign workers through electronic means if the worker requests for it. The Migrant Workers’ Centre is stepping up education efforts to encourage workers to make such requests. They are also making arrangements to help foreign workers to open bank accounts. In addition, as earlier announced, MOM is consulting with stakeholders on the further step of making electronic payments of salaries mandatory for all Work Permit Holders."
regulation on collation and use of behavioural data and patterns by online platforms,"Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Communications and Information whether the Ministry sees a need to regulate in Singapore the collation and use of behavioural data and patterns from online platforms by introducing ""do not track"" legislation and, if not, why not.","Mr S Iswaran: Currently, some websites and online platforms track their users’ behaviour by collecting data on their browsing habits and activities, and use the data to serve targeted advertisements or improve browsing experiences.Organisations should ensure that their collection, use and disclosure of users’ behavioural data comply with the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (PDPA). In the event of a complaint, the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) will investigate and take enforcement action if it assesses that there is a breach of the PDPA.As Singapore’s Digital Economy develops, we envisage that businesses will increasingly leverage such data to offer better, more innovative products and services that are tailored to their users’ preferences. At the same time, we recognise public concerns over the widespread collection of personal data by online platforms, and the potential misuse of such data.There are tools and mechanisms already available today that provide a balanced and effective approach to prevent the unwanted tracking of individuals. For example, individuals who are concerned with tracking may block and delete cookies, or use plugins and browser extensions to prevent websites from profiling them. They may also request not to be tracked when browsing a website. Most modern browsers come with such functionalities. The Media Literacy Council also provides tips on basic ways in which users can guard against online tracking.MCI and PDPC will continue to monitor developments on this issue, and ensure that our policies continue to safeguard individuals’ interests while allowing data-driven innovation in the Digital Economy."
tracking of financial situations of comcare’s assistance recipients after gaining employment,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked To ask the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) whether the Ministry tracks the financial situations of Comcare's short- to medium-term assistance recipients after they gain employment; and (b) how many recipients of such Comcare assistance reapply for assistance within a year after the end of their assistance.,"Mr Desmond Lee: ComCare is part of the multiple layers of assistance provided by the Government to support low-income individuals and families. Other programmes include Workfare, medical and education subsidies, and housing assistance. Households that require help to tide over periods of difficulty are provided Short-to-Medium-Term Assistance (SMTA), which provides financial assistance for daily living expenses, help with household bills, and other forms of support such as referrals to Workforce Singapore’s Careers Connect for employment assistance or to Family Service Centres for casework and counselling.SSOs keep track of clients’ situations while they are receiving ComCare assistance. Those who have gained employment while on ComCare assistance may still receive assistance for a period of time, as they work towards financial stability in their new jobs. SSOs may also continue to provide assistance if their clients’ incomes from work are assessed to be insufficient for their household living expenses (e.g. those who are in part-time jobs).There are various reasons why clients reapply for assistance, such as when they face new challenges in their family, work, or health circumstances. We do not have readily available data for households that gained employment while they were on SMTA, and subsequently reapplied for ComCare within a year after the SMTA ended."
transition period for hdb dwellers on welfare assistance to adjust to higher rent from salary increase,"Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for National Development for HDB dwellers who are under welfare assistance and who may have received some salary increase from their employment, whether a transition period can be given to them to help them make adjustments before they are asked to pay a higher rent based on their new salary.","Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB already provides a rent transition period to public rental tenants when their income increases. Households with monthly income below $800 pay the lowest rent tier which starts at $26 for a 1-room flat, or $44 for a 2-room flat. At tenancy renewal, HDB waives the rent increase for one tenancy term1 if the household’s income crosses the $800 threshold but remains within the income ceiling of $1,500. At the subsequent tenancy renewal, even if the household’s income increases further, HDB will waive the rent increase for another tenancy term if the increase in income is low relative to the rent increase and the household remains within the income ceiling. HDB works closely with Social Service Offices to support families placed on ComCare schemes under the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF).  For households receiving Short-to-Medium Term Assistance (SMTA), HDB will determine the rent payable based on an individual assessment of their financial situation. Those receiving ComCare Long Term Assistance will automatically qualify for the lowest rent tier."
average waiting time required for registration of lasting power of attorney,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what is the average waiting time required for the registration of a Lasting Power of Attorney by the Office of the Public Guardian from submission until notification of successful registration; (b) what are the reasons for the waiting time required; and (c) whether the Ministry has any plans to reduce the waiting time.,"Mr Desmond Lee: The average waiting time required to register the Lasting Power of Attorneys (LPA) received in June 2018 is approximately 60 working days. This includes the mandatory 6 weeks’ waiting period required under the law.Applications to the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) to make LPAs have doubled, from an average of 950 per month in 2016 to an average of 1,928 per month for the first seven months in 2018. OPG has increased its resources to handle the rise in applications, and the waiting time has shortened. Currently, the LPA can only be made in hard copy, which requires manual processing. This impacts efficiency. OPG is undertaking a Business Process Re-engineering study, with a view towards developing an online, more citizen-centric LPA system, which should cut down processing time."
singaporeans awarded scholarships by foreign universities,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Education in the past three years, how many Singaporeans have been awarded scholarships by foreign universities.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: Many established universities give out scholarships to deserving international students, at the undergraduate and post-graduate levels, such that they pay lower or close to no tuition fees. Some of the foreign universities that Singaporean students attend on such scholarships include the University of Cambridge, University of Hong Kong, Peking University, Fudan University and Waseda University. For some European countries such as Austria, France, Germany and Norway, university tuition is either free or fees are significantly marked down for all students, including international students. Schools do not actively track the number of their students who have been awarded scholarships by foreign universities."
time banking in healthcare institution for volunteer work performed,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry will consider launching a pilot project for time banking in a healthcare institution whereby hours put into volunteer work can be converted into credits and deposited in a healthcare database for later use at the healthcare institution where the volunteer work took place.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Volunteers play an important role in the public healthcare system. We have around 2,000 volunteers of all ages, across the public healthcare institutions (PHIs), who contribute their time in areas ranging from cancer support, to organizing recreational activities for patients, and providing care and pastoral services. These volunteers include ex-patients, members of the public, students and even staff, who do so out of their passion to serve.Our PHIs regularly review their volunteer management practices to incorporate new ideas where feasible and appropriate. Whilst the concept of time-banking is an interesting one, it is important to ensure that we do not inadvertently crowd out the intrinsic motivation of our volunteers to serve others. Our PHIs show recognition and appreciation for our volunteers through various initiatives, such as annual volunteer celebrations, training to develop leadership and patient interaction skills, and recognition awards. We will continue to study the landscape to explore how we further improve the recognition of the efforts of our volunteers, and learn from best practices."
number of appeals for financial assistance on nsmen’s exit permit bond amounts from 2008 to 2017,Mr Chong Kee Hiong asked the Minister for Defence in each of the last 10 years (a) how many appeals for financial assistance have been received from parents who experienced difficulty putting up the bond amounts for their sons' exit permits; (b) how many parents have failed to put up the bond amount; (c) how many have defaulted on their bonds; and (d) what measures are available to assist parents who are unable to afford the full amount of the bonds.,"Dr Ng Eng Hen: National Service-liable males who intend to reside overseas for an extended period – two years or longer for those aged 13 to 16.5 years, and three months or longer for those aged above 16.5 years – will be required to furnish a bond of S$75,000 or 50% of the combined annual gross income of both parents for the preceding year, whichever is higher. On average, about 40 cases each year are granted concessions to reduce the bond amounts or provide other measures in lieu of a bond, on compassionate grounds. About five cases per year had their bonds forfeited when they failed to return."
number of accidents at zebra crossings in 2017,"Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) in the past year, how many accidents have happened between motorists and pedestrians at zebra crossings; and (b) whether cameras can be installed at zebra crossings with high accident rates.","Mr K Shanmugam: In 2017, there were about 60 road traffic accidents involving pedestrians at zebra crossings. Three resulted in fatalities. To enhance safety, the Land Transport Authority (""LTA"") has put in place warning signs such as ""Pedestrian Crossing Ahead"", zig-zag lines and flashing beacons near the crossings, so that motorists are more alert as they approach. LTA has also installed at selected locations raised zebra crossings, which serve as speed humps for vehicles. We will also continue to educate the public on the safe use of zebra crossings. For example, as part of the ""Use Your RoadSense"" campaign in 2017 and 2018, the Singapore Road Safety Council launched online videos on how pedestrians should use zebra crossings. For now, we think these measures are adequate, and cameras need not be deployed. "
notices at public locations to guide members of public on use of aeds,Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether notices providing guidance on the use of AED or highlighting the option of calling 995 to get help on the use of AEDs can be put at all public locations where AEDs are installed to assist members of public needing to use the AEDs but have not received training on how to use them.,"Mr K Shanmugam: AEDs are easy to operate – the user simply needs to turn on the machine and follow the voice prompts. Callers to the 995 Operations Centre will also be guided on performing chest compressions and applying the AED. In addition, every AED cabinet installed in HDB blocks under the SCDF's Save-a-Life initiative comes with a QR Code that links to an online instructional video. A new sticker, with clear step-by-step instructions on how to handle suspected cardiac arrest cases, will also be affixed to the bottom left of the AED cabinet by July 2019. "
number of cyclists on non-power assisted bicycles caught for traffic offences between 2008 and 2017,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Home Affairs between 2008-2017, what is the number of cyclists on non-power assisted bicycles who have been caught each year while riding on the road for each of the offence of (i) beating red lights (ii) cycling against the traffic (iii) cycling in the dark without front white lights and/or rear red lights/reflectors and (iv) cycling on the right side of a motor vehicle proceeding in the same direction when not overtaking the motor vehicle.","Mr K Shanmugam: For traffic offences committed by cyclists, we do not track the data for power-assisted and non-power-assisted bicycles separately. Over the past 10 years, the average annual number of summonses issued against cyclists were about: (a) 40 for beating red-lights; (b) 450 for disorderly riding without due regard for the safety of others on the road. This includes riding against traffic, amongst others;(c) 295 for riding in the dark without a front light or rear reflector; and(d) One for riding abreast of a motor vehicle. "
measures to assist singapore citizens who have to serve two stints of military service,Mr Chong Kee Hiong asked the Minister for Defence for a child born to a Singaporean parent and a parent whose country also implements compulsory military service (a) what measures are there to assist these children who may have to serve two stints of military service or national service; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider reviewing its policies to take into account time already spent serving compulsory military service in another country.,Dr Ng Eng Hen: The Enlistment Act is applicable to all Singapore citizens even if they have chosen to hold foreign citizenship concurrently. It recognises rightly that all male citizens must perform their National Service duties to defend Singapore even as they enjoy privileges and benefits as citizens. Their obligations from other citizenships they have chosen cannot exempt them from the obligations and responsibilities as a Singaporean. 
motor insurance protection for innocent third-party victims of drink driving accidents,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Transport how are innocent third-party victims of drink driving accidents protected by motor insurance.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act requires all drivers of vehicles to be insured against third-party claims on bodily injury or death before they can drive their vehicles on our roads. Insurance policies cannot be restricted from paying out for such liabilities incurred from drink driving. This protects innocent third-party victims of drink driving accidents. Neither do they prevent the insurer from recovering the sum paid out from the insured.Drivers who contravene the above requirement may on conviction be fined up to $1,000 and/or be imprisoned for up to three months. They may also be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving license for 12 months from the date of conviction. "
help for residents who received unsolicited text messages from loansharks and finance companies,"Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Home Affairs how can the police help residents who receive unsolicited text messages from loansharks and finance companies, threatening them to pay up though they have no dealings with them whatsoever.",Mr K Shanmugam: Members of the public who receive unsolicited text messages from moneylenders should not reply to these messages. Those with information on unlicensed moneylenders can call the Police hotline at 1800-255-0000 or the National Crime Prevention Council's X Ah Long hotline at 1800-924-5664. All information given to the Police will be kept confidential. 
top three reasons for drugs consumption by first-time offenders,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Home Affairs for first-time offenders in Drug Rehabilitation Centres (DRCs) (a) what are the top three reasons they consume drugs; and (b) what is their median per capita household income.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The most commonly cited reasons for drug consumption by first-time offenders include (a) to cope with stress, (2) out of curiosity, and (3) due to peer pressure.  Based on the data provided by first-time offenders admitted to DRC in 2017, the median monthly individual income is about S$1,600. We do not track the household income of drug offenders."
annual breakdown of total value of assets misappropriated for economic crimes from 2014 to 2018,Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Home Affairs for each year from 2014 to 2018 (a) what is the total value of assets misappropriated or gained by offenders who have been convicted for committing economic crimes in Singapore; and (b) what is the total value of assets recovered by the enforcement authorities.,"Mr K Shanmugam: We do not track such data.As to the number of commercial crimes reported, this has remained stable over the last three years from 2015 to 2017."
age profile when single unwed parents had their child in past five years,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Social and Family Development in each of the past five years, how many single unwed parents were at the point of the birth of their child (i) below 35 years old (ii) between 35 years old and 36 years old and (iii) 36 years old and above respectively.","Mr Desmond Lee: The age profile of citizen mothers with non-marital births, at point of birth registration, is as follows: "
number and percentage of eligible cpf members making withdrawals from age 55 in last five years,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the number and percentage of eligible CPF members who made withdrawals from age 55 in the last five years; (b) what was the average amount withdrawn; (c) how many withdrew to the limit; (d) how many were eligible to withdraw up to $5,000 only; and (e) how many withdrew the full $5,000.","Mrs Josephine Teo: Upon turning 55, all CPF members can make a withdrawal of $5,000, subject to available balances in the Ordinary and Special Accounts. In addition, those with savings above the Full Retirement Sum (FRS) can withdraw all the monies above that amount. Those who own a property can withdraw monies above the Basic Retirement Sum (BRS) using property charge or pledge.  For the three cohorts of 186,000 CPF members that turned 55 from 2014 to 2016, around 109,000 (59%) members made a withdrawal within a year of their 55th birthday. These included both active as well as infrequent contributors to the CPF. The average amount withdrawn was about $34,000. Of the 109,000 members, 62% of them or around 68,000 withdrew the maximum allowable amount. Of the 105,000 members who could withdraw up to $5,000, 57% or around 60,000 did so.3. Through schemes like the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) and Silver Support (SS), the Government continues to provide additional retirement support to lower-income Singaporeans as well as seniors who could not build up much CPF in their working lives. Based on latest available data, 424,000 Singaporeans received $667 million in WIS in 2016 and 152,000 seniors received SS payouts totalling $333 million in 2017."
trend of illegal foreign worker dormitories discovered over last three years,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Manpower over the last three years (a) what is the trend of illegal foreign worker dormitories being discovered; (b) how many instances of illegal housing have occurred in HDB flats; (c) how has the Ministry worked with HDB to tackle illegal housing issues; and (d) what are the plans to ensure proper housing and fire safety in worker housing and dormitories.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: The number of housing cases where foreign workers (FW) were housed illegally, in contravention of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (EFMA), has been stable for the last three years. In 2017, 24 of these illegal FW housing cases were found in HDB flats. MOM and HDB investigate all complaints of HDB flats being used illegally to house foreign workers. If the employer is culpable, appropriate enforcement action will be taken, such as debarment from employing FWs, fines or prosecution. The employer will also be ordered to relocate the FWs. HDB may also take enforcement actions against flat owners who have breached HDB's rental regulations, such as revoking their approval for the flat owners to rent out their flats.MOM works closely with partner agencies, such as HDB, URA and SCDF, to regularly review FW housing standards including fire safety and hygiene. Inspections are carried out by both MOM and SCDF. Between 2015 and 2017, MOM took 3,900 employers and dormitory operators to task for a range of infringements. The enforcement actions taken included financial penalties and prosecution in egregious cases. Although the proportion of severe infringements has fallen, MOM will continue to adopt a strict enforcement stance and monitor the situation closely.  "
usage of skillsfuture credits,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Education (a) how many Singaporeans have used up their SkillsFuture credit; (b) whether he can update the House on the review for the next phase of the national SkillsFuture Credit Scheme; and (c) whether there are plans to top up SkillsFuture credits.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: As of end 2017, around 50,000 Singaporeans have fully utilised their Credit. This is about 2% of the total eligible pool.When reviewing the top-up to SkillsFuture Credit, we will take into account factors such as the SkillsFuture Credit utilisation rate, Government's fiscal position, and the overall training participation rate of Singaporeans. While SkillsFuture Credit has enthused Singaporeans to embrace lifelong learning, it is only one part of a larger system of support. MOE provides funding for a wide range of SkillsFuture programmes. Programmes such as SkillsFuture for Digital Workplace are delivered to the community at highly subsidised fees of $501. SkillsFuture Advice is also a free workshop for residents to better understand their training needs.  "
singaporeans receiving training in continuing education and training modules in institutes of higher learning under skillsfuture series,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Education (a) how many Singaporeans would have received training in Continuing Education and Training (CET) modules in Institutes of Higher Learning (IHL) under the SkillsFuture Series by the end of 2018; (b) what is the profile of the Singaporeans by age group and highest educational attainment; and (c) what are the expected Government expenditure and revenue for each IHL.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: SkillsFuture Series focuses on emerging and critical skills, and is a subset of the Continuing Education and Training (CET) programmes offered by the IHLs. Demand has been increasing since its launch in October 2017. By end 2018, we expect more than 16,000 participants would have completed training under the programme. SSG subsidises up to 70% of the course fees for programmes under the SkillsFuture Series and expects to spend on average $25 million a year on the programme for the first three years.In 2017, about 30% of those who attended CET programmes were aged below 30, about 40% were aged 30 to 49 and about 30% were aged 50 and above. In 2017, in terms of educational attainment, about 15% of individuals who attended CET programmes had up to primary qualifications, and close to 35% had secondary qualifications. About 30% of the individuals had diploma or post-secondary qualifications and about 20% had a degree."
next review of public assistance scheme,Mr Seah Kian Peng asked the Minister for Social and Family Development when is the next review of the Public Assistance scheme.,"Mr Desmond Lee: The ComCare Long-Term Assistance (LTA) scheme, which is commonly known as the Public Assistance (PA) scheme, provides a package of support for individuals and families who are permanently unable to work due to illness or old age, and lack familial support. Households on the LTA scheme receive monthly cash assistance for their daily living expenses. Additional assistance is provided for those who have recurrent medical needs such as consumables, or specialised one-off needs such as medical equipment. LTA clients also receive free medical and dental treatment at the polyclinics and Government hospitals and have access to government-funded social services such as Senior Activity Centres and befriending services.MSF regularly reviews the scope and coverage of our ComCare assistance schemes to ensure that they meet the needs of low-income groups. The last enhancement to the LTA scheme was in 2016 when the cash assistance rates were raised. We are in the midst of our latest review.  "
non-subsidised foreign students admitted into universities and private tertiary institutions in past three years,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Education (a) in the past three years, how many non-subsidised foreign students have been admitted into our universities and private institutions that offer degree and above programmes respectively; and (b) whether the Ministry will continue to make education an engine of economic growth to attract non-subsidised foreign students to study here.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: Like all reputable universities around the world, our publicly-funded universities admit international students (IS) to enrich the education experience. Today, they form about 10% of the undergraduate intake. Of these, there is a mixture of full-fee paying students, and those on the Tuition Grant scheme, who have a service obligation to work in Singapore for three years after graduation. At the postgraduate level, unsubsidised IS currently make up around one third of the total intake. IS in Private Education Institutions (PEIs) do not receive Government subsidies. "
progress update on thomson-east coast mrt line,Mr Seah Kian Peng asked the Minister for Transport whether he can provide an update on the progress of the Thomson-East Coast MRT Line.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Works on the Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL) are progressing well. TEL is on track to open in five stages from next year. Structural works for Stage 1 were completed in 2017 and architectural, electrical and mechanical works are now about three-quarters complete. We will complete the construction of the TEL Mandai Depot and commission it ahead of the opening of TEL's first three stations (Woodlands North, Woodlands and Woodlands South) by end next year. To meet this schedule, LTA has commenced integrated testing between the Depot's Operation Control Centre and the various systems in the three stations.Separately, the first TEL train has arrived at the TEL Mandai Depot, and two more trains will soon be delivered. The remaining 88 TEL trains will be delivered in batches between now and 2023. LTA will continue to work closely with the contractors to ensure that works on Stages 2 to 5 of the TEL remain on track, with the TEL, our sixth MRT Line, expected to be fully complete by 2024, linking Woodlands to Bedok."
actual national bonus and annual variable component (in months) paid to cabinet ministers yearly from 2013 to 2017,Mr Leon Perera asked the Prime Minister in each year from 2013 to 2017 (a) what has been the actual National Bonus (in months) paid to Cabinet Ministers; and (b) what has been the actual Annual Variable Component (in months) paid to Cabinet Ministers.,Mr Teo Chee Hean: This question for written answer has been addressed by oral reply to Question No 1 taken on 1 October 2018.
result of introduction of open electricity market in jurong,"Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) since the introduction of the Open Electricity Market in Jurong, what is the total number of residents who have made a switch to purchase their electricity from a retailer of their choice; (b) whether there is a poll or study done to gauge the level of awareness level of the new electricity retail options and, if so, what is the outcome; (c) whether there is a poll or study done to gauge the satisfaction level of customers who have switched to purchasing their electricity from a retailer and, if so, what is the outcome; and (d) whether there were any issues raised by residents who have switched to purchasing electricity from various retailers.","Mr Chan Chun Sing: The Energy Market Authority (EMA) introduced the Open Electricity Market (OEM) in Jurong in April 2018, providing around 120,000 households and small businesses with the choice to buy electricity from a retailer with a price plan that best meets their needs. This soft launch was well-received. As of mid-September 2018, more than 30% of Jurong households have switched to a retailer.To better understand the public's reception towards the OEM soft launch, EMA conducted a survey involving the Jurong residents about three months after the soft launch started. The survey results showed that the Jurong residents generally felt positive about the OEM, with very high awareness of the OEM and their electricity purchase options. About nine in 10 of the survey respondents indicated that they were aware of the OEM and the electricity purchase options available to them. Of those who had switched to a retailer, about eight in 10 appreciated the benefits of the OEM and indicated that they found the switching process easy.A small number of residents highlighted that they experienced higher electricity bills after switching to a retailer. There are a few possible explanations:(a) SP Group reads electricity meters once every two months. On alternate months when the meters are not read, the consumer’s bill is based on estimated consumption. Any underestimated readings will be carried over to the next bill, which would make the next bill higher.(b) Depending on when a consumer switched, his first bill may not cover a full month. The following month's bill will be relatively higher as it will cover a full month of electricity consumption.(c) Another possible reason for higher electricity bills is that electricity usage could be higher during certain periods of the year, for example, school holidays or hotter months of the year.With the zonal rollout of OEM starting from 1 November 2018, EMA will continue to ensure that the necessary safeguards are in place to protect consumers. EMA will also continue to work closely with SP Group and the retailers to inform and educate consumers about the OEM."
water bodies in singapore open for fishing,Mr Seah Kian Peng asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) which are the water bodies in Singapore that are open for fishing; and (b) whether there are plans to open more such water spots for fishing.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Since 2004, PUB has progressively opened up its reservoirs and waterways for water sports and activities such as kayaking, dragon boating and fishing under the Active, Beautiful and Clean (ABC) Waters Programme. This is to bring the community closer to water, so that they can better cherish and appreciate this precious resource.Today, the public can fish at designated areas within 10 reservoirs and five waterways such as Kolam Ayer ABC Waterfront, Geylang River, Rochor Canal, Bedok Reservoir, Lower Seletar Reservoir and Pandan Reservoir. The full list can be found on PUB's website. Popular fishing locations such as Bedok Reservoir, Pandan Reservoir and Kolam Ayer ABC Waterfront are frequented by recreational users, including families and anglers, especially on weekends. The designated fishing areas are located a safe distance away from water activity zones, footpaths and park connectors. As reservoirs are key sources of water supply, ensuring the water quality in our reservoirs is of utmost importance. Nevertheless, PUB will continue to assess and open up suitable new sites for water sports and activities. Exercising a little consideration goes a long way in making our reservoirs and waterways a safe and pleasant environment for all to enjoy. PUB appeals to the public to adopt responsible fishing practices, such as fishing only at designated areas, casting lures with care to avoid injuring others, and discarding unwanted fishing lines and hooks properly. Members of the public are encouraged to call the PUB hotline at 1800-2255-782 should they spot any illegal and unsafe fishing activities."
extras for home improvement programme,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether the Home Improvement Programme (HIP) can include replacements of windows for older flats and to provide aircon ledges to prevent the hazard of falling aircons for public safety; (b) how many households have opted for deferred payment instead of full settlement by cash under HIP so far; and (c) whether HDB has ensured that prospective buyers of such resale flats whose existing owner opted out of HIP is aware of this for fair sale purposes.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Residents are responsible for regular maintenance of the windows to ensure that they are safe and secure at all times. Most residents install custom-made windows based on their preference, and these are of varying sizes, colours, different configurations and designs. It would thus be best to leave the replacement of these windows to flat owners.External air-conditioner ledges were provided in HDB flats from the early 1990s onwards. For flats without air-conditioner ledges, the Building Control Regulations stipulate that residents need to install stainless steel brackets to support any external air-conditioning units. This is to ensure public safety. There is therefore no need to provide air-conditioner ledges under HIP.As at 31 August 2018, about 90,000 households have been billed for the Home Improvement Programme (HIP). Of the households billed, 11.5% households have opted for deferred payment and 88.5% households have made full payment. Amongst those who made full payment, about half of them paid by cash.The status of flats undergoing upgrading programmes such as HIP is published on the HDB InfoWeb. Prospective flat buyers can therefore check the status of the flat they are interested in. Upon ascertaining that the flat is undergoing HIP, they would need to check with the sellers on the HIP components, that is, Essential/Optional that the sellers have opted for and factor these into their price negotiation with the sellers before committing to the purchase."
take-up rate of funding support for initiatives to reduce plastic packaging,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources in respect of funding support for initiatives to reduce plastic packaging (a) what is the current take-up rate of the 3R Fund and 3P Partnership Fund; and (b) how popular are these schemes among the food delivery and food and beverage industries.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The 3R Fund is a co-funding scheme that supports companies to reduce waste and encourage recycling. As of July 2018, NEA has disbursed $1.4 million for 19 completed projects and committed another $2.5 million in support of 22 ongoing projects. The 3P (People, Private and Public) Partnership Fund supports ground-up environmental initiatives. Over the past three years, about $3.2 million was disbursed in support of more than 3,000 projects, with about three quarters of funding going towards waste minimisation activities. We supported the Zero Waste SG's Bring-Your-Own Campaign which has averted the use of two million pieces of plastic disposables and packaging waste. 430 retailers and F&B companies came together to encourage consumers to bring their own reusable containers, bottles and bags. We also supported F&N to work with retailers and tertiary institutions to raise awareness of recycling plastic bottles and aluminium cans.We are heartened that some food delivery companies are discouraging the overuse of plastics on their own accord. Foodpanda and Deliveroo provide options for customers to exclude disposable cutlery in their orders. We welcome more of such initiatives from the food delivery and food and beverage industries and are prepared to support companies' efforts to reduce plastic packaging and plastic waste through the 3R and 3P Partnership Funds. "
result of latest round of property cooling measures,Mr Ang Wei Neng asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether the latest round of property cooling measures have achieved the intended objectives; (b) what is the rationale for tightening the loan-to-value (LTV) limits for first-time property buyers; and (c) what is the overall impact on the first-time property buyers in view of the latest cooling measures.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The property cooling measures implemented on 6 July 2018 are intended to moderate the residential property market cycle and keep price increases in line with economic fundamentals. Loan-to-Value (LTV) limits were tightened across all housing loans, including those taken by first-time buyers, as the price increases prior to the measures were broad-based across the market, reflecting demand from all types of buyers. However, we maintained Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty (ABSD) rates for Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents buying their first residential property.As the measures were only introduced recently, it is premature to conclude whether they have been effective. Nevertheless, there are early signs that the measures may have kept the pace of price increase in check. Based on URA's latest flash estimate of the Property Price Index, prices increased by 0.5% in 3Q 2018, compared to 3.9% and 3.4% in 1Q and 2Q 2018 respectively. The Government will continue to monitor trends in the property market, and adjust our policies as necessary, to maintain a stable and sustainable property market."
trend of successful tender bids for religious sites over last 10 years,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for National Development over the last ten years (a) what has been the trend of successful tender bids for religious sites; and (b) what are the plans to intensify land use for such sites.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Over the past 10 years (2008-2017), seven Place of Worship (PW) sites were launched and successfully awarded. In June 2012, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) relaxed the allowable Gross Plot Ratio (GPR) and storey height controls for PW developments. This has allowed for intensification of some PW sites, subject to local site conditions, and whether the proposed intensification would adversely affect surrounding uses. In September 2018, MND announced the revised tender process for PW sites to ensure that only religious groups that actively contribute to the community and have a genuine need for worship space are allowed to bid. Under the revised framework, MND will also be releasing land for PW hubs, which can house multiple religious organisations belonging to the same religion, in a multi-storey development. Smaller religious organisations who find the standard PW sites too large for their own use can band together under one PW hub. Through co-location and sharing of facilities such as car parks, Singapore’s limited land resources will be better optimised. "
extension of additional financial support to mothers who require healthcare due to pregnancy complications,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Health whether the Minister will consider extending additional financial support for (i) couples who experience pregnancy complications and require inpatient and outpatient healthcare and mental wellness support and (ii) expectant mothers who find it difficult to obtain maternity insurance from private insurance companies due to previously-experienced pregnancy complications.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: All Singaporeans including expectant mothers receive up to 80% subsidy for inpatient treatments in public hospitals, and up to 70% subsidy for subsidised treatments at specialist outpatient clinics. Over the past three years, about eight in 10 expectant mothers who received inpatient treatment for a pregnancy or delivery complication in B2/C wards had an out-of-pocket payment of less than $500, after subsidies and Medisave. Couples who face financial difficulties with their medical bills may approach medical social workers at our public hospitals for assistance, including tapping on Medifund.MOH recognises that some serious pregnancy complications could result in large bills. MOH is currently reviewing how MediShield Life can help to cover inpatient treatments for serious pregnancy and delivery complications. We will provide details when ready. "
number of commercial or retail buildings providing e-waste recycling bins,"Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources to date, what is the total number of commercial or retail buildings that provide e-waste recycling bins.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: To promote the environmentally sound management of e-waste, NEA has worked with industry partners to set up voluntary e-waste recycling programmes which provide recycling bins at public locations for consumers to recycle their e-waste. Examples of these programmes include StarHub's Recycling Nation’s Electronic Waste (RENEW), Singtel x SingPost ReCYCLE and the M1 Drop-off Point Campaign. There are currently more than 500 such voluntary e-waste recycling bins across Singapore, and around 170 of them are found in commercial or retail buildings. In 2017, these bins collected about 140 tonnes of e-waste in total.Building on these voluntary initiatives, my Ministry will implement a national e-waste management system based on Extended Producer Responsibility by 2021. The mandatory system will scale up our e-waste management efforts and consumers can expect greater convenience when recycling their e-waste. "
measures to ensure safety and efficacy of vaccines made by changsheng biotechnology,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Health (a) whether any vaccines made by Changsheng Biotechnology are used in Singapore; and (b) if so, what measures are being taken to ensure that these products are safe and medically efficacious.",Mr Gan Kim Yong: No vaccines produced by Changsheng Biotechnology had been approved for use in Singapore.
progress in supporting singapore companies go regional,"Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what is the progress in supporting Singapore companies to go regional; (b) to date, how many companies has the Ministry successfully helped in regional expansion; and (c) what are the future plans especially for expansion in ASEAN.","Mr Chan Chun Sing: Helping Singapore companies internationalise is a key thrust of Singapore's economic strategy. ASEAN alone represents a market of USD 2.55 trillion in GDP and a population of some 650 million1. The Government supports companies' internationalisation in several ways. First, we provide targeted grant support for SMEs making their first foray into overseas markets through the Market Readiness Assistance (MRA) scheme. In 2017, 1,629 MRA grants were disbursed, which included support for SMEs expanding into regional markets like Indonesia, Myanmar, Vietnam, India and China for the first time. To help companies that have had overseas exposure but which need more tailored assistance to expand overseas or access additional overseas markets, we provide help in the form of the Global Company Partnership (GCP) programme. In 2017, the GCP which comes with a grant assisted 419 companies in the areas of capability development, market access, and manpower development for internationalisation. Of these, about 40% were for companies expanding within Southeast Asia. MTI and our agencies regularly review these grant schemes to provide more customised support to local enterprises seeking to develop new capabilities to scale up and internationalise. Second, we support businesses' efforts to develop their manpower and talent, to better understand regional markets. Examples of partnership with companies include the Youth Talent Programme which targets to send 1000 students each year for work opportunities in overseas markets, the Professional Conversion Programme for Southeast Asia Ready Talent which integrates job-matching and reskilling to help professionals gain new skills for job roles within the Southeast Asian region, and the ASEAN Leadership Programme which trains C-Suite business leaders on strategies to leverage on ASEAN’s growth. Together, these programmes help to build up groups of Singapore students and professionals with more specialised knowledge and in time, experience and networks in the Southeast Asia’s markets. Third, Enterprise Singapore (ESG)'s international network of offices and in-market partners facilitates leads and connections for companies venturing overseas. In 2017, ESG (then-International Enterprise Singapore) successfully facilitated over 450 overseas projects for Singapore companies. The Plug & Play Network, which helps SMEs access new markets by providing in-market assistance in business advisory services, business matching, and market set-up, was also launched in 2017. SMEs can now gain access to assistance in over 45 major cities across six Asian markets, including Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Ho Chi Minh City, New Delhi and Shanghai. ESG also partnered Trade Associations and Chambers to facilitate visits by about 6,000 businesses to overseas markets through business missions and participation in international trade shows. As the ASEAN Chair this year, Singapore has also worked with member countries to deepen regional connectivity and improve trade facilitation. At the recently concluded 50th ASEAN Economic Ministers Meeting, two new Agreements on services and trade facilitation were signed and an ASEAN Agreement on e-Commerce was endorsed. These agreements2  when they take effect will give Singaporean businesses greater access to ASEAN's services markets and save costs and time for Singaporean businesses by making customs procedures less burdensome. The ASEAN Agreement on e-Commerce will lower the costs for Singaporean businesses by improving the speed and reliability of supply chains in cross-border e-Commerce transactions.  The Government is firmly committed to continuing to support our companies to seize overseas opportunities and grow. "
take-up rate for aircraft leasing scheme,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what is the current takeup rate for our Aircraft Leasing Scheme; (b) for the eight out of the top ten aircraft leasing companies which have their operations in Singapore, how many of them are participants of the Scheme; and (c) how is our Scheme more competitive vis-à-vis that of our closest rivals such as Hong Kong and Ireland.","24 Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what is the basis for the Ministry's claim that Singapore has 20% of the global market share in aircraft leasing; (b) for the eight out of the top ten aircraft leasing companies which have their operations in Singapore, how does the Ministry define ""operations""; and (c) how many of them account for their lease income and aircraft assets in the profit and loss and balance sheets, respectively, of their Singapore entities.Mr Chan Chun Sing: Singapore's competitiveness as a base for aircraft leasing companies is founded on several factors, including our extensive network of Avoidance of Double Taxation Agreements (DTAs); our strong financial industry and professional services ecosystem which provide supporting services to aircraft leasing businesses; and our established aviation and aerospace industries which complement the aircraft leasing industry with their deep knowledge and quality services. Several companies of varying sizes seeking to develop aircraft leasing capabilities in Singapore have availed themselves of the Economic Development Board (EDB)'s Aircraft Leasing Scheme (ALS). The ALS is just one of the ways in which the EDB works with aircraft leasing companies to capture growth opportunities for the industry, strengthen the larger ecosystem of related industries, and create good jobs for Singaporeans. While Singapore's competitiveness cannot be attributed solely to our tax regime, factual details of tax regimes across jurisdictions including Ireland, Hong Kong and Singapore can be found in the respective government publications. Eight out of the top 10 aircraft leasing companies have offices in Singapore and are registered with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA). Aircraft leasing companies in Singapore may undertake activities such as sales, leasing, and financing depending on their business models. In addition, they are required to comply with accounting and tax filing requirements under Singapore law.While Singapore is generally recognised as one of the top aircraft leasing hubs alongside Ireland which is the industry leader, as reported in industrial reports and news articles, other cities in our region are also competing to capture opportunities arising from Asia's increasing demand in air travel. We will need to continue to partner one another to strengthen Singapore’s position as the preferred base for the world to access Asian markets, and for regional companies to access the world. "
complaints from mobile customers about being subscribed to third-party services without their consent,"Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) in the past year, many complaints have been received from mobile customers about being subscribed to third-party services without their consent; (b) under what grounds do such situations arise and what is being done to prevent it; and (c) whether assistance and refunds will be given to elderly consumers who are victims of these situations.","Mr S Iswaran: Premium Rate Services (PRS) are value-added services delivered over mobile telecommunication networks, and include third-party services provided to mobile customers. In 2017, the Infocommunications Media Development Authority (IMDA) received 91 PRS-related complaints. These complainants generally claimed that they were charged for PRS that they did not subscribe to. IMDA's investigations revealed that these end users had actually subscribed to the PRS without reading the terms and conditions carefully.  IMDA has implemented several measures to protect consumers against accidentally subscribing to PRS. Currently, the Code of Practice for the Provision of Premium Rate Service (PRS Code) requires service providers to publish the terms and conditions of their services clearly, and confirm end-users' purchases before activating the PRS. Since 2012, IMDA has required mobile operators to offer a PRS barring service for free. Consumers who activate this service will not receive or be billed for any chargeable PRS. Since the PRS barring service was introduced, the number of PRS-related complaints has dropped by approximately 80% from 483 complaints in 2012 to 91 complaints in 2017. IMDA has also stepped up our consumer education efforts, including giving talks at events targeting seniors, distributing brochures and uploading educational videos on YouTube. Where consumers including seniors have accidentally subscribed to PRS, IMDA will also step in to engage the service provider. In several cases, the service provider has waived the subscription charges incurred on a goodwill basis, and the mobile operator has thereafter activated its PRS barring service. Nevertheless, we urge consumers to also ensure that they fully understand the terms and conditions before activating any PRS. "
singaporeans seeking medical help for sleep-related problems,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Health (a) what are the figures and trends of Singaporeans seeking medical help for sleep-related problems over the past decade; (b) what the main types of sleep-related problems facing Singaporeans; (c) whether sleep deprivation is increasingly a concern in fast-paced and work-oriented Singapore; and (d) whether there is the need to step up measures to address sleep deprivation considering that long-term sleep deficit is detrimental to health.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Having sufficient, good quality sleep is an important component of a healthy lifestyle. Insufficient or poor quality sleep can lead to impaired cognition, and increased risk of health concerns such as obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and mental health issues. Insomnia, that is, difficulty sleeping and obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) are the two most common sleep-related problems that Singaporeans seek medical help for. From 2012 to 2016, the number of patients diagnosed as having insomnia at polyclinics has been stable, averaging 5,100 persons per year. The number of admissions to public hospitals for OSA increased from 3,592 in 2012 to 4,685 in 2017. They could be due to varying factors including increased awareness and more referrals. The Health Promotion Board (HPB) has various initiatives to raise awareness on the importance and benefits of adequate sleep, especially for the young. Efforts include incorporating messages in HPB's stress and psycho-emotional programmes for school children, and engaging parents through workshops to emphasise their role in inculcating good sleep habits in their children. HPB's HealthHub and a microsite also provide additional information on sleep, and tips on good sleeping habits for adults and children. Our public hospitals hold regular forums to increase awareness about sleep disorders and their effects on health. MOH and HPB will continue to encourage Singaporeans to adopt good sleep habits as part of a healthy lifestyle."
pre-ticked boxes for purchase of additional goods and services or seeking consent from consumers in online transactions,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether pre-ticked boxes for purchase of additional goods and services or seeking consent from consumers in online transactions can be made illegal.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing: In general, the Government adopts a balanced approach of supporting a pro-enterprise environment and safeguarding consumers' interest. Consumers are encouraged to take steps to protect themselves before making their purchases. This would include checking the terms and conditions of contracts which they are about to enter into; what they are paying for; and the supplier’s refund policies. If consumers are unsure about any terms and conditions, they are encouraged to clarify with the suppliers. Suppliers should also be upfront and transparent with consumers about material terms and conditions in their agreements so consumers can make an informed decision.If consumers have reason to believe that the suppliers have engaged in unfair trading practices, they can approach the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) with details of these practices for CASE to assist them in seeking redress from the suppliers. The Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act protects consumers against errant retailers which engage in unfair trading practices, including attempts to conceal information or mislead consumers. Under the CPFTA, CASE can invite suppliers to cease their unfair practices through a Voluntary Compliance Agreement. The Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore, as the administering agency of the CPFTA, is also empowered with investigation and enforcement powers to take action against errant retailers who persist in unfair practices.We note the member's suggestion regarding pre-ticked boxes and will study it further, taking into account feedback from relevant stakeholders and global best practices. "
hdb flats transferred to estate of deceased owner who are also flats' owners,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development (a) in each of the past 10 years, what is the number of HDB flats that have been transferred to the estate of the deceased owner who are also the flat's owners; (b) of these, what is the breakdown by flat types and by lease balance respectively; and (c) how many beneficiaries/administrators of such estates have sold the HDB flat left over by the deceased.","Mr Lawrence Wong: In cases where the flat is held in joint tenancy, the deceased's interest in the flat is passed on automatically to the surviving co-owner without the need for a transfer to the estate of the deceased. The surviving owner may lodge a Notice of Death (NOD) with the Singapore Land Authority, to ensure that the title deed reflects the change in ownership. HDB does not actively track when an NOD is lodged, especially if the NOD was lodged without HDB's assistance. On the number of HDB flats sold by an administrator or executor of an estate upon demise of all its owners, HDB's records indicate that there were 1,890 such cases in the past 10 years from 2008 to 2017.  "
requirement for use of medisave for emergency treatment at overseas hospitals,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Health whether residency in Singapore is a requirement for the use of Medisave for emergency treatment at overseas hospitals and, if so, what are the reasons for this requirement.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Medisave is intended to help Singaporeans save for their medical expenses, especially during old age, and its design takes into account significant Government subsidies for Singaporeans. The use of Medisave is therefore targeted at Singaporeans seeking subsidised care here.Nevertheless, MOH understands that on very rare occasions, some Singaporeans may find themselves in difficult situations due to medical emergencies when travelling overseas, and require help with their medical costs incurred for such emergencies. We do exercise flexibility to allow the use of Medisave in such situations as an exception on appeal, especially for individuals normally resident in Singapore. We review such appeals carefully, taking into account the circumstance of each request on a case by case basis.  "
annual average subsidy disbursed per chas cardholder,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Health what is the annual average subsidy disbursed per CHAS cardholder since the scheme started and what is the projected annual expenditure for CHAS subsidies for the next five years.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) was launched in 2012. Over the years, benefits and coverage of CHAS have been expanded and the number of CHAS cardholders has also increased.  In 2017, a total of $154 million was disbursed to about 650,000 CHAS beneficiaries, equivalent to more than $200 subsidy per beneficiary, compared to $13 million disbursed in 2012 to 75,000 beneficiaries, equivalent to approximately $170 per beneficiary. MOH plans to extend CHAS subsidies to all Singaporeans with chronic conditions, to enable more Singaporeans to benefit from subsidised chronic care at CHAS general practitioners. With this expansion, the projected total CHAS subsidies is expected to rise. The details are being worked out. "
making union membership fees/dues tax deductible or as a relief,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Minister for Finance whether union membership fees/dues can be made tax deductible or as a relief such as in other jurisdictions across the globe.,"Mr Heng Swee Keat: Our tax treatment of union membership fees follows the same tax deductibility rules under the income tax system that we apply consistently on all expenses. Under our income tax regime, union membership fees are not tax deductible. This is also the case in other jurisdictions like Hong Kong.  Nevertheless, the Government recognises the importance of a strong labour movement to the success of tripartism in Singapore. The labour movement plays a strategic role in helping Singapore stay competitive and workers remain employable. Hence the Government has and will continue to provide support to the unions through various grants."
"average and median starting salaries of ite, polytechnic and university graduates","Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked ask the Minister for Education in 2015, 2016 and 2017, what have been the average and median starting salaries of ITE, polytechnic and university graduates working in (i) the private sector and (ii) the civil service.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: Based on the annual Graduate Employment Surveys (GES) conducted by the Institutes of Higher Learning, the median reported gross monthly starting salaries of ITE, polytechnic and Autonomous University (AU) respondents in full-time permanent employment in the private and public1 sectors are as shown in Table 1. "
employers and community stakeholders registered under sg enable or have employment programmes for special needs adults,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) to date, how many employers and community stakeholders are registered under SG Enable or have some form of employment programme for special needs adults; (b) what is the Ministry doing to encourage more to come on board to hire special needs people; and (c) whether more can be done to help employers with adapting the workplace and designing jobs for special needs employees.","Mr Desmond Lee: To date, SG Enable and its VWO partners have worked with more than 1,000 employers to hire persons with disabilities. SG Enable works with employers to build up their capabilities to train, hire and integrate persons with disabilities into their workforce. It offers advisory and consultancy services, disability management workshops and training at the Enabling Village, as well as job shadowing, internship and mentorship programmes and various online resources. It also helps employers assess their readiness to hire persons with disability and to identify areas they could work on to become more inclusive employers. When employers are ready to hire, SG Enable and its VWO partners will provide job placement and job support services.  The Government supports private sector employers who hire persons with disability in a variety of ways. For example, we give a Special Employment Credit to provide a wage off-set and defray costs for employers hiring persons with disabilities. We also provide grants under the Open Door Programme, which is a scheme administered by SG Enable and supported by Workforce Singapore and MSF. The Open Door Programme helps to fund employee training, workplace modifications, job re-design as well as the purchase of assistive technology devices that support persons with disabilities at work. Later this month, SG Enable will hold the annual Inclusive Business Forum, which brings employers and other stakeholders together to share best practices and to collaborate in order to create more opportunities and supportive workplaces for persons with disabilities. MSF will continue to work with our partners to bring more employers on board the inclusive hiring journey. Under the Third Enabling Masterplan, the Government will also enhance opportunities for persons with disabilities to leverage their abilities and secure meaningful jobs. We will work with key stakeholders such as industry leaders to identify new areas of skills development and to refine training and vocational programmes in our special education schools, to better prepare our students for employment. Business networks such as the Enabling Employers Network have also been set up so that businesses can learn from each other and support each other as they work towards becoming more inclusive. "
per-trip payment of heavy vehicle drivers,"Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Government will ban the payment of heavy vehicle drivers on a ""per trip"" basis to prevent excessive speeding or dangerous driving by the drivers.","Mrs Josephine Teo: There were 10 fatal accidents involving heavy vehicles in the first half of 2018, a significant reduction from the 20 in the same period last year. Nonetheless, we should aim to prevent all accidents. It is not clear that banning ""per trip"" payments is the solution. The Traffic Police's investigations have found that the top causes of heavy vehicle accidents are related to driver behaviour: failing to keep a proper lookout, failing to control the vehicle and reckless lane changing. In MOM's investigations into heavy vehicle accidents, we found that drivers on other payment arrangements can also exhibit careless driving behaviour.The Safer Roads Industry Taskforce, comprising representatives from Government agencies, transport and logistics companies and unions, studied the issue of heavy vehicle safety. It concluded that it was more effective to enhance companies' ability to manage driver behaviour, and to build drivers' safety awareness, rather than to ban ""per trip"" payment. The Taskforce's recommendations in 2016 sought to influence driver behaviour by (i) leveraging technology, (ii) expanding driver training, and (iii) strengthening company processes and systems.  To leverage technology, the Traffic Police is conducting a trial to study the suitability of speed-tracking devices for heavy vehicles. MOM has also launched a Technology Challenge to fund the development and test-bedding of devices that can improve vehicular safety. Solutions undergoing test-bedding with logistics companies include those that alert drivers of risky behaviour like speeding and tail-gating. If the trials are successful, MOM will work with relevant agencies and trade associations to promote adoption of these solutions. To expand driver training, MOM and the Traffic Police have worked with the Automobile Association of Singapore to launch a heavy vehicle vocational driver training course, subsidised by SkillsFuture Singapore. It provides refresher training on top of that given for the heavy vehicle licensing test. To improve company processes and systems, the Workplace Safety and Health Council has been educating more companies on safe driving. For instance, under the Drive Safe, Work Safe campaign launched in June 2018, more than 200 companies have pledged their commitment to prevent vehicular accidents.  "
update on assistance provided to sungei road hawking zone users,"Mr Kok Heng Leun asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether he will provide an update on (i) the types of assistance provided to Sungei Road Hawking Zone (SRHZ) users since September 2017 and (ii) the status of the 120 or so SRHZ users who had not taken up the Ministry's offers for relocation, job placement or financial assistance.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The Sungei Road Hawking Zone (SRHZ) was closed on 10 July 2017. Ahead of its closure, various agencies, including the National Environment Agency (NEA), Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), Workforce Singapore (WSG), and Central Singapore Community Development Council (CDC) provided SRHZ users with financial, employment and social support. These included the provision of lock-up stalls at hawker centres managed by NEA, referrals to other flea markets, financial assistance, and job placement. In September last year, we updated that the Government had engaged about 200 SRHZ users. Close to 80 received some form of assistance. Since then, the agencies have helped about 20 more former users. Hence, to date, a total of about 100 out of the 200 users have received Government assistance. Around 40 former users have taken up stalls at hawker centres, and about 30 former users have chosen to operate at other flea markets. Another 30 users have received employment and/or financial assistance. Of the 200 users who were engaged, 100 or so users have declined assistance. We understand that they have other means of support, such as employment or family support. We will continue to engage and render assistance to former SRHZ users who come forward. "
proportion of foreign domestic workers with off-day stipulated in contract,"Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how effective has the policy dated 2013 been in terms of the proportion of foreign domestic workers who have an off day stipulated in their contract; and (b) how effective has it been in ensuring that foreign domestic workers actually have a physical, emotional and mental rest from work.","Mrs Josephine Teo: It is a condition of all Foreign Domestic Worker (FDW) work permits issued or renewed from 2013, that their contracts should provide a weekly rest day or compensation in lieu.  MOM conducts regular surveys with FDWs. Based on the most recent survey in 2015, the proportion of FDWs reporting at least one rest day a month was 98%, compared to 53% in 2010. The percentage of FDWs with four rest days also increased to 56% from 25% in 2010. These results are consistent with a survey of FDWs conducted by the Centre for Domestic Employees in 2017, where 96% had at least one rest days a month and 60% had four rest days a month.In MOM's survey in 2015, more than 95% of FDWs indicated that their workload was either just right or they were able to handle more, which suggests that the FDWs are sufficiently well-rested to perform their tasks. At the same time, the incidence of FDW complaints to MOM pertaining to overwork or insufficient rest, remains low.MOM's next survey in 2019 will provide further updates."
regional studies programme and scholarship introduced,"Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for Education (a) when was the Regional Studies Programme (RSP) and its scholarship introduced; (b) since its introduction, how many students have been granted the RSP scholarship; and (c) what is the breakdown of the scholarship recipients based on ethnicity.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: The Regional Studies Programme (RSP) and the RSP scholarship was introduced in 2008, with the aim to nurture a segment of non-Malays in each generation who are comfortably conversant in the Malay Language and able to engage regional countries effectively. RSP students offer either Malay (Special Programme) or Bahasa Indonesia as a third language. They also have the opportunities to experience school-based enrichment modules on Understanding Southeast Asia; and participate in learning journeys as well as take part in cultural camps and immersion trips to Southeast Asian countries. About 400 of every secondary school student cohort take part in the RSP, of which 100 are given the scholarships. Around 90% of the recipients are Chinese and 10% are Indian and Other Races."
criteria for rental of flats under hdb’s public rental scheme,"Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for National Development whether, with respect to families living in rental flats under HDB's Public Rental Scheme, the income ceiling as well as rent payable for the flats, currently based on monthly household income, may instead be based on per capita household income.","Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB takes a needs-based approach in assisting public rental applicants and tenants, including those who are above the income ceiling. This includes taking into account their household size and expenses when assessing their requests for public rental, and their ability to pay rent. The majority of HDB public rental tenants have a household size of three or less. In addition, more than half of public rental households pay basic rents, which are $26 to $33 a month for a 1-room flat and $44 to $75 a month for a 2-room flat. The remaining households pay higher monthly rents based on their household incomes. If tenants face difficulty affording their rents, HDB looks into their individual circumstances and can exercise flexibility for them to pay a lower rent. "
"costs of visits for systemic lupus erythematosus, spondyloarthritis and psoriatic arthritis","Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Health for each of the years from 2015 to 2017, what have been the respective numbers of unique patients, unique visits, and the average and median costs of each visit for (i) Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (ii) Spondyloarthritis and (iii) Psoriatic Arthritis.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: The 2015 to 2017 subsidised B2 and C ward hospitalisation statistics on Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, Spondyloarthritis and Psoriatic Arthritis are in the following table. MOH does not collect specific Specialist Outpatient Clinic (SOC) data and primary care data for these three conditions."
singaporeans aged 55 and above with hospital bills for inpatient treatment exceeding daily medisave withdrawal limits,"Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Health (a) in the past two years, how many Singaporeans aged 55 and above have hospital bills for inpatient treatment that exceed their daily Medisave withdrawal limits; (b) what are the common reasons for this; and (c) whether the daily Medisave withdrawal limits for unemployed elderly persons can be of a higher daily limit so as to avoid payment requiring cash.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: To ensure inpatient treatment remains affordable, means-tested Government subsidies of up to 80% are available to all Singaporeans at our public healthcare institutions. In addition, all Singaporeans are covered by MediShield Life which protects them against large bills, and they can utilise Medisave for the co-payment portion of their hospitalisation costs.  Currently, more than seven in 10 hospitalisations by Singaporeans aged 55 and above in the subsidised wards (B2 or C ward types) do not require any cash payment, and more than eight in 10 paid less than $100 in cash. This means that with subsidies and MediShield Life, the Medisave claim limits are generally sufficient to cover the large majority of patients' hospitalisation bills. Where the patient's financial circumstances are more challenging, MOH may also consider allowing more Medisave use on appeal. Singaporeans who require additional financial assistance can also approach medical social workers at our public healthcare institutions to apply for Medifund. We regularly review our Medisave withdrawal limits, in conjunction with subsidies and MediShield Life coverage, to ensure that good quality, basic inpatient care is affordable for all Singaporeans. Any changes to the Medisave withdrawal limits must take into account possible impact on Singaporeans' CPF contribution rates and our Medisave adequacy in the longer term."
scams involving letters designed to look similar to official government letters,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) how can companies and individuals avoid being scammed by letters that are designed to look similar to official Government letters; (b) whether the Ministry can help to raise more awareness about such scams apart from cyber scams; and (c) whether heavier penalties can be imposed as such scams can have severe repercussions.,"Mr K Shanmugam: Companies and individuals can adopt the following measures to avoid being a victim of scams that use official-looking letters or emails: First, they should exercise vigilance when dealing with unsolicited letters or emails, especially when personal banking details or payments are being sought;Secondly, they can call the relevant authorities to ascertain the authenticity of the letter or email;Finally, they can seek scam-related advice via the Anti-Scam Helpline at 1800-722-6688 or visit www.scamalert.sg.The Police and NCPC will continually review these measures. The Member also asked whether heavier penalties can be imposed. We think that the sentencing range under existing legislation is adequate. A person who is convicted of a cheating offence under section 420 of the Penal Code may be liable for imprisonment of up to 10 years. But above all, I urge Singaporeans to remain alert and vigilant against scams. "
misuse of airport boarding passes,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is the number of cases of misuse of airport boarding passes in the last five years; (b) what are the main reasons for the misuse; (c) what actions have the Ministry taken against these offenders; and (d) what is the Ministry's plan to reduce such misuse cases.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The transit areas of Changi Airport are gazetted as Protected Places under the Protected Areas and Protected Places Act. It is an offence for persons to misuse their boarding pass to enter the transit areas with no intention of proceeding with their journey. Persons who are found guilty of misusing their boarding pass are liable for a fine of $1,000/-, or imprisonment for two years, or both.From 2015 to 2017, Police detected an average of 44 cases of boarding pass misuse each year. Most of the offenders gained entry into the transit areas to purchase goods from the duty-free shops, send off friends and relatives, or try to meet celebrities.Police have worked with the airport community to put up signs to explicitly warn travellers that it is an offence to misuse boarding passes. These signs are displayed at airlines' check-in counters, departure entrances, and immigration counters. Police are exploring with the airlines to print the warnings on the boarding passes, and to publish the warnings on the airlines' website. Police also publicise cases of boarding pass misuse to educate the public. "
reported cases of senior citizens falling or injured while taking public buses,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Transport (a) in the past three years, how many cases have been reported of senior citizens who have fallen and got injured while taking public buses; and (b) what are the measures taken to prevent such incidents so as to ensure safe travel for senior citizens on public buses.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: There are about 50 incidents each year of senior citizens who were injured after losing their balance on public buses. The majority of these incidents happened when the buses moved off from a stationary position or stopped abruptly to avoid vehicles cutting in. To reduce such incidents, bus operators are installing telematics systems which enable bus captains to review and improve their driving patterns, such as minimising sudden movements. To date, about 70% of public buses are equipped with telematics systems. However, it is not possible to eliminate all abrupt movements by buses. For example, bus captains may have to apply emergency brakes to respond to unanticipated traffic incidents. To enhance safety for senior citizens, we will continue to encourage younger commuters to give up their seats to them. "
advisory to owners of e-scooters which do not conform to lta's regulations,"Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether there is any advisory on what should be done by the owner of an e-scooter that does not conform to LTA's regulations, such as its method of disposal; and (b) if there is no such advisory, whether LTA will consider to produce such an advisory.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: All personal mobility devices (PMDs), including e-scooters, that are used on public paths cannot exceed 20kg in maximum unladen weight, 700mm in maximum width and 25km/h in maximum device speed.Persons with non-compliant devices may wish to approach retailers to check if these devices can be modified to become compliant, or traded in for compliant devices. Persons who wish to recycle their devices may contact e-waste or metal recyclers for assistance. A list of recyclers can be found on the National Environment Agency (NEA)'s website at www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/waste-management/3r-programmes-and-resources/collectors-traders-and-local-recycling-facilities. "
national service defaulters,"Mr Ang Wei Neng asked the Minister for Defence (a) for the past 10 years, what has been the number of outstanding National Service (NS) defaulters; (b) how many have been eventually charged or pardoned; (c) what have been the efforts to trace and prosecute NS defaulters especially when they are overseas; and (d) what are the criteria for providing clemency to NS defaulters, if at all.","Dr Ng Eng Hen: Over the past 10 years, an average of about 350 National Service (NS) defaulters each year have either failed to register or enlist for NS, or failed to return after their Exit Permit has expired. Among these, about one third have been arrested or have come forward to resolve their Enlistment Act offences. Efforts to trace and contact NS defaulters include sending registered mails to their last known place of residence, including their overseas address, house visits to their local addresses, and contact tracing through educational institutions that they have attended. The enforcement and punishment of NS defaulters is governed by the Enlistment Act and judicial processes. MINDEF works with the Police to arrest these defaulters. Those who are charged have their punishments meted out by the Courts in accordance with the Enlistment Act. "
government contributions or subsidies for wages of long-term care workers,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Health what can be done to increase Government contributions or subsidies for the wages of long-term care workers including those in voluntary welfare organisations.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: In addition to patient subsidies, MOH also provides direct funding to subsidised long-term care (LTC) service providers to help them defray their operating costs, including manpower costs. Over $200 million of funding had been extended to 59 LTC service providers between 2012 and 2017 to raise the salaries of LTC staff. This has led to an average increase of local LTC workers' salaries by around 30% across participating providers over this period. We also support skills training, through scholarships and grants, productivity improvement and job redesign initiatives to raise the value of jobs alongside salary increases.We will continue with our efforts to improve career opportunities in the LTC sector and we will regularly review funding support for salaries of LTC staff to ensure that they are adequately recognised for their contributions."
coverage of and payouts to disabled persons under careshield life,Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Health whether coverage of and payouts to disabled persons under CareShield Life for the remainder of their lives will be provided so long as they remain Singapore citizens or residents.,Mr Gan Kim Yong: CareShield Life is a national scheme and a key pillar of our social safety net. Singapore Citizens and residents covered under CareShield Life will have lifetime coverage and receive payouts for as long as they remain severely disabled. 
bonus payments to cabinet ministers,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Prime Minister in each of the past five years, what has been the bonus paid to Cabinet Ministers in terms of (i) the average total number of bonus months (ii) the highest total number of bonus months paid to an individual Minister and (iii) the lowest total number of bonus months paid to an individual Minister.","Mr Lee Hsien Loong: The average Performance Bonus (PB), and the range of PB received by Political Office Holders of all grades over the past five years were:The pay components of political office holders are set out in the White Paper on ""Salaries for a Capable and Committed Government"" tabled in Parliament in 2012. Apart from monthly salary, the salary components include 13th month Non-Pensionable Annual Allowance, Performance Bonus, National Bonus, and Annual Variable Component as paid to civil servants. The benchmark salaries take all these components into account.The Prime Minister formed a Committee in 2017 to review whether the salary framework established in 2012 remains appropriate and valid against its intended goals, and what adjustments may be useful; and whether there is a need to adjust the salaries should there be a change in overall salary levels based on the proposed framework.DPM Teo Chee Hean informed Parliament in March this year that the Committee had affirmed that the current salary structure for political appointment holders, including the National Bonus framework, remained sound. Therefore, we should maintain this structure. While the MR4 benchmark had increased by 9% since 2011, the Government noted that the 2017 MR4 benchmark was lower than the 2016 MR4 benchmark, and hence had decided to maintain salaries at the current level and watch salary trends further. That remains the position."
possible adverse economic and psychological impact of move to cashless society,Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Prime Minister whether the Government has thoroughly assessed the possible adverse economic and psychological impact that the move to a cashless society will have on particular segments of society.,"Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): Ms Lim asked about the adverse impact of a move towards a cashless society. We do not aim to be a completely cashless society. Cash has been with us for centuries, and will be around for quite some time more.  Electronic payments are growing in ease and convenience, and more Singaporeans are taking to e-payments every day. Today, more than 8 in 10 Singaporeans are using some form of e-payments. More than a million Singaporeans have signed on to PayNow. We want to help every segment in society to be able to use e-payments when it is convenient and beneficial to do so.  For consumers, e-payments are now a lot more convenient than cash. Payment is as simple as waving a card, a smart phone or scanning a QR code. More importantly, for the elderly, it means not having to carry cash for all their needs, and does away with many trips to the ATM. As it is, cash withdrawals at ATMs are coming down by S$300 million every year.For small businesses, accepting e-payments helps to reduce the time and effort in counting cash, reconciling money, and depositing the money in the banks. For a hawker, it means no need to handle cash as he prepares food, which also improves hygiene. It has been estimated that the cost of processing cash is about S$2 billion a year, or 0.5% of GDP in 2015. This is the amount that businesses collectively, especially small businesses, can potentially save.The supporting infrastructure for e-payments has now been developed. We have implemented FAST to facilitate real-time inter-bank account transfers. With PayNow, both individuals and companies can pay one another using their NRIC numbers or phone numbers or Unique Entity Number as the case may be. And Singapore is the first country to adopt a standardised QR Code for payments. Every merchant will just have one QR code for every e-payment scheme it decides to accept, and there will be no confusion on what QR code to scan.However, the benefits and convenience of e-payments are not fully felt yet. This is mainly because the solutions building on this infrastructure are just beginning to proliferate. The standardised SGQR is being rolled out progressively. And as more businesses sign up for PayNow Corporate, it will become easier for people to pay their bills or pay for goods and services or even hawker food by scanning a QR code using their mobile phone. The good thing about paying by QR code is that it does not need any payment accepting devices, and the entry barrier is very low.There is also the alternative of contactless payments. NETS and the major consumer banks are progressively replacing older NETS cards with newer NETS contactless bank cards in the coming months. A person just needs to wave his or her NETS contactless bank card to make a payment. This is actually the most convenient and intuitive e-payment mode for the elderly, who are already familiar with using their contactless concession cards for public transport.E-payments will for sure be more convenient over time, as the solutions to support it become more user-friendly, people gain familiarity with them, and they become pervasive.We are putting effort into educating the public to help everyone take advantage of e-payments. IMDA has launched the e-Payment Learning Journey to help seniors learn how to make digital transactions. SkillsFuture Singapore has rolled out a SkillsFuture for Digital Workplace programme to reach out to members of the public. Banks are also re-skilling branch customer service staff, to become digital banking ambassadors, to help customers enjoy the benefits of digital banking, including e-payments. In many constituencies, students are volunteering to help educate less digitally-savvy residents.  Through the collective effort of the Government, industry players and the community, we can make e-payments work for all by bringing about greater convenience and benefits."
update on status of 11 critical information infrastructure sectors identified to review their connections to untrusted external network,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Prime Minister with regard to the 11 sectors identified to review their connections to untrusted external network (a) what is the timeframe for the sectors to complete their review; (b) whether Government grants and funding will be provided to assist companies in these sectors to beef up their cybersecurity capabilities; and (c) how does the Government plan to work with these companies to ensure that they stay vigilant.,"Mr Lee Hsien Loong: In light of the recent cyber-attack on SingHealth’s computer systems, the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) instructed the 11 Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) sectors to strengthen their network security, including taking the following steps:Remove all connections to unsecured external networks if there are no strong business or operational reasons to keep such connections open.If connections to unsecured external networks are required, these should ideally be mediated through uni-directional gateways, for example, data diodes to prevent data leakage.If two-way communications between the secured network and unsecured external network is required, a secured informational gateway has to be implemented, such as filters for malicious content and firewalls. The 11 CII sectors are currently conducting a review of their systems, in consultation with CSA. This process will be completed by the end of 2018.The Government will continue to review the essential security measures that CII owners must adopt. Ultimately, these security measures must strike a balance between security, operational efficiency and cost. This is a dynamic balance that will be reviewed as the threat landscape evolves. In an increasingly digital world, cybersecurity is critical to protecting business operations and strengthening trust between businesses and their customers. The Government will therefore not be providing grants or funding to CII owners to comply with cybersecurity requirements and implement such cybersecurity measures which should be borne by companies as part of normal business costs. Nevertheless, the Government and CSA will continue working closely with CII owners and businesses to strengthen their cybersecurity posture. This includes rendering professional advice to businesses, and working with the industry to provide affordable and convenient cybersecurity services to companies. In addition, the Singapore Computer Emergency Response Team (SingCERT) will continue to educate the public and businesses on how to protect themselves in cyberspace. Businesses and members of the public can visit SingCERT at www.csa.gov.sg/singcert and Gosafeonline at www.csa.gov.sg/gosafeonline for cybersecurity advisories and tips."
re-employment of retired civil service employees,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Prime Minister in each of the past three years (a) what is the percentage of retired and re-employed civil service employees who have been given one year and multiple-year contracts respectively; (b) what is the percentage of civil service employees not given a second re-employment contract after the first re-employment contract; and (c) how is the civil service helping employees who wish to continue working but are not offered re-employment contracts.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing (for the Prime Minister): Between 2015 and 2017, nine in 10 officers in the Civil Service who retired and wished to continue working, were re-employed at age 62. 77% of these officers were re-employed on multiple-year contracts. 22% of them were re-employed on one-year contracts. The remaining officers were re-employed on contracts of less than one-year duration with mutual agreement between the officers and their agencies. Of the officers who were re-employed on one-year contract at age 62, 87% continued to be re-employed in the following year. The Public Service Re-employment Guidelines take reference from the Tripartite Guidelines on the Re-employment of Older Employees, including the guidelines on employment assistance to officers who wished to continue working but were not offered re-employment. As a best practice, agencies will work with these officers to find alternative employment, which may include referring them to vacancies within the Public Service and providing career resources and refresher training to facilitate officers' search for jobs. "
reason for consistently higher number of expired category d (motorcycle) coes,"Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether LTA is aware of any reason for the consistently higher number of expired Category D (Motorcycles) COEs; (b) if so, what are the reasons; and (c) whether LTA has any concerns that this could be the result of an attempt at market speculation of Category D (Motorcycles) COEs.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The practice in the motorcycle trade is for the dealers to bid for Category D COEs under their names and to hold a stock of Temporary Certificates of Entitlement (TCOEs). This allows their buyers to take delivery of the motorcycles immediately. This is the business model that our motorcycle dealers have adopted. (This is unlike the motor car trade where the dealers only bid for TCOEs upon confirmation of demand.)Under the current motorcycle business model, the dealers take some risk that they may not be able to use up all the TCOEs at the end of the six-month validity period. Over the past three years, Category D TCOEs which expired at the end of the validity period made up about 3%. There is no evidence of market speculation at play."
data on citizen deaths,Mr Leon Perera asked the Prime Minister (a) whether the Ministry can release data for Singapore citizens deaths over the last 10 years (as distinct from resident deaths); and (b) at what year in the future will citizen deaths exceed citizen births according to existing demographic forecasts.,"Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): The total number of resident deaths has increased from around 16,200 in 2008 to 19,800 in 2017. The total number of citizen deaths has increased from around 15,600 in 2008 to 19,100 in 2017. Based on current trends1, the number of citizen deaths could exceed the projected number of citizen births around the mid-2030s. "
plans to review eligibility criteria for national service deferment,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar asked the Minister for Defence (a) whether there are plans to review the eligibility criteria for National Service (NS) deferment; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider setting up a review committee comprising esteemed individuals beyond the defence and armed forces sector to review applications for NS deferment on their individual merits.,"Dr Ng Eng Hen: Singapore's founding leaders knew the strict conditions that National Service (NS) would impose on its citizens when they passed the NS (Amendment) Bill 51 years ago and the Enlistment Act in 1970. In 1984, just as he was about to retire, a reflective Dr Goh Keng Swee acknowledged it plain and simple – ""National Service imposes (not only) a great sacrifice of time and money on the young men called up.""1 But Dr Goh followed with the reason why NS was crucial to our nation’s survival – ""deep in his heart the average Singapore citizen knows the danger he faces are real and not hypothetical, and that there is a need to defend ourselves.""2  The Appellate High Court also brought their minds to bear on our NS policy in 2017 during an appeal on the sentencing of NS defaulters. Their written judgement3 spelt out the reasons why more stringent sentencing benchmarks were justified but those same reasons lie at the heart of what Members of Parliament (MPs) have asked today – how strict is this requirement for every male to serve his NS when required? What exceptions or flexibility can be given? It was a landmark decision, presided over by the Chief Justice. The Appellate High Court referred to DPM Teo's Ministerial Statement given in 2006 to this House, when he was Defence Minister. That Ministerial Statement coupled with the written judgement, illuminate the fundamentals on which our NS policy are based, that we must not unwittingly weaken lest we undo this nation's foundations. I urge all Members to read them. The judges opined that, ""In practical terms, what the three fundamental principles of national security, universality and equity mean is that in order to ensure Singapore's national security, every male Singaporean must serve NS and at the time he is required to under the [Enlistment] Act, without regard to his personal convenience and considerations. When a person refuses to serve NS at the time that he is required to and instead returns to serve at a time of his own choosing, or worse, at an age when he can no longer serve, his actions strike at the very core of the principles of national security, universality and equity.""4  Thirteen NS defaulters were prosecuted after the new sentencing framework was established last year. In Court, each gave reasons why he did not enlist as required. Some wanted to complete their university degree first before NS. Others said they had to support their families. In every judgement, the Courts dismiss these personal reasons, convicted and sentenced them to jail terms. Harsh as it is, the Enlistment Act is blind to ""personal convenience and considerations""5, no matter how talented the individual or exceptional his circumstances. At the core of the Enlistment Act, the critical national need for a strong defence puts aside personal pursuits and mandates that each liable male performs his NS when required.The written judgement noted that everyone was asked to do his ""fair share""6 – ""This entails every citizen who is required to serve NS making sacrifices or postponing individual goals to serve the nation when the nation needs his service""7. These arguments spell out in unequivocal terms the NS obligations for every Singaporean male. Deferment therefore cannot be for that individual, no matter how talented, to pursue his own interests or career, even if it vicariously brings credit or fame to Singapore. This would be fundamentally wrong and goes against the core principle of equity.Some Singaporeans have voiced the same opinions over Mr Davis' application. Mr Suresh Nair, who wrote, ""Let this Davis case be the right and timely reminder of the need for absolute fairness in applying laws regarding NS deferment"".8 To preserve equity for all national servicemen, MINDEF will only defer individuals very selectively if their deferment serves Singapore's interest first and foremost, never their own. This was the only basis to defer three sportsmen, swimmers Joseph Schooling and Quah Zheng Wen, and sailor Maximilian Soh, from NS to train and compete in the Olympics. The sportsmen deferred know this, as clear expectations were laid out when deferment was given, in discussion with the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY) on the standards required for their training. Neither was deferment open-ended nor unconditional. They will have to return to serve NS, and if they do not meet the standards agreed upon, deferment will be curtailed. These strict conditions are necessary because even for these individuals who can bring glory to Singapore, there are detractors, who think it’s unfair for anyone to be deferred. Mr T Ng wrote to MINDEF – ""Please be fair to all Singaporean males, who spent years serving NS. Every Singaporean male's career is important from his own point of view.""9  Disruption for individuals after they are enlisted for NS follows the same principles and is also given only for national reasons. We disrupt medical students to complete their medical studies because we need them to serve as Medical Officers during their NS to take care of their fellow soldiers. It’s not an entitlement and once the reasons are no longer valid, the disruption will end. For example, we previously allowed overseas medical students to disrupt, but this was stopped in 1992, when we could produce enough doctors locally. Similarly, dental students were not disrupted after 1989, as there was no need for NS Dental Officers. For transparency, MINDEF publishes a full list of all medical students who are disrupted every year.Having stated the general principles, let me explain why the application by Mr Harvey Davis for his son's deferment was rejected even though MINDEF recognised Mr Ben Davis' achievement in obtaining a senior contract with Fulham Football Club (FC).First, Mr Ben Davis is playing for Fulham FC as an English national, not a Singapore citizen. MINDEF is not privy to the contract signed between them, but we assume this published information is correct and that the father must have his reasons for doing so.Second, Mr Harvey Davis has consistently refused to indicate when his son would return to serve NS, if deferred. The father replied to MCCY, Sport Singapore (SportSG) and Football Association of Singapore (FAS), stating – ""We are unable to commit to a date for his return should he be playing professional football in the UK or Europe. In addition, it is also a possibility that Ben could be offered a new two-year contract in 2019 after the first year of his pro-contract just like he has been offered a new two-year pro contract half way through his two-year scholarship contract. Or, he could be sent out on loan or sold to another club. There are a lot of variables all dependent on his development and progression.”10  Third, if he was not granted deferment, the father indicated that Mr Ben Davis would still proceed to sign the contract, and he has done so. The reason given by the father was that his son would only return to fulfil his NS commitment if he is unsuccessful in his professional career. In fact, Mr Harvey Davis went further after MINDEF rejected the application – that he would consider the option for his son to renounce his Singapore citizenship in order to pursue his career. The father's responses made clear his intent for his son to pursue a professional football career to the fullest. If Mr Ben Davis will not give up his senior contract, which provides for an allowance of a few hundred pounds a week, to serve his NS, it is even more unlikely that he will return to serve NS if he subsequently gets offered a contract worth many times more. And if he is not given a further contract with Fulham FC, the father has said that he may find other clubs which his son can be loaned to. The application by Mr Harvey Davis for his son's deferment is to further his son’s professional career first and to the longest extent possible. He has been quite open about this. Singapore and her interests, including his son’s NS obligations, are secondary consideration, if at all. There has been no indication, commitment or plans as to how Mr Ben Davis would help football standards in Singapore, if deferred. Mr Harvey Davis has urged MINDEF to approve deferment for his son so that it would serve as an inspiration, he tells us for the 1000 students registered with his company JSSL, 500 or so who are local. JSSL Singapore, or Junior Soccer School & League Singapore, is a youth football club and academy business run by Mr Harvey Davis and advertises itself as having links to Fulham FC. MINDEF could not find any valid grounds to approve the application for deferment by Mr Harvey Davis for his son. There is no commitment to serve Singapore or our national interests. To grant deferment to Mr Ben Davis to pursue his personal development and professional career would be unfair to the many others who have served their NS dutifully as required, and not at a time of their choosing. It would also erode the basis on which our Courts have upheld the Enlistment Act passed by Parliament and punished those for not fulfilling their NS liabilities to pursue personal pursuits.As a writer, Mr Patrick Tan Siong Kuan, wrote to The Straits Times (ST) Forum – ""The defence of our country cannot be a matter of serving when it is most convenient. It is a responsibility that every man must take seriously when called upon, regardless of race, family connections or financial status. It takes personal sacrifice and putting the country before self. Otherwise, there will be no Singapore tomorrow.""11  Mr Suresh Nair who wrote to the MINDEF Feedback Unit – ""If Davis is proud of his red passport, he must do what every Singapore teenager does, to dutifully observe the NS obligations.""12  I know it must be difficult for a 17-year-old to receive such public attention. It was never MINDEF's intent, but MINDEF had to respond to his father’s claims to the media to explain to MPs and Singaporeans the basis of our decision on this important policy. I have dealt with the application by Mr Harvey Davis for his son. Let me now address the important issue that MPs have asked – can and how do we achieve sporting excellence, including for team sports, if NS duties are to be fulfilled? NS does require sacrifices, certainly personal ones, but performing one's NS duties and pursuing national aspirations for sports excellence need not be mutually exclusive.Many talented sportsmen have served NS as required and yet at the same time raised the level of their own skills and the teams they played with. To MINDEF's knowledge, there are three other footballers who have also been talent spotted to take part in trials for professional leagues overseas. All three have completed their NS as required – Saifullah Akbar, Ikhsan and Irfan Fandi. In fact, Saifullah Akbar and Ikhsan Fandi asked to be enlisted early, presumably so that they could complete their NS early to pursue their professional careers. Prior to enlisting, Saifullah played for the Under-16 national team and was reportedly spotted by an Australian club at age 16 but went ahead to enlist for NS. During their NS, Irfan and Ikhsan trained and played for the Under-22 national team during the 2017 SEA Games, supported by the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) and Home Team. Irfan and Ikhsan are now playing for the Young Lions in the Singapore Premier League and representing Singapore in regional football competitions. I understand Irfan has gone for trials with European clubs, including an upcoming trial with Sporting Braga, and Saifullah and Ikhsan are slated to follow suit at CD Tenerife and Braga, respectively. All of us will certainly cheer them on to succeed. This is a good sign for football in Singapore and talented footballers, Ben Davis included, can emulate the example of Irfan, Saifullah and Ikhsan to complete both their NS duties as required and also advance their professional football careers.For the recent SEA Games 2015, and 2017, MINDEF supported those competing, both as a team and individually. Enlistment dates for NS were adjusted for those affected so that they could participate in the games first, including some footballers. Those who were already enlisted were given time off to train and maintain their peak performance. For the upcoming Asian Games later this month, so far, ten of our national servicemen have been given a short postponement of their enlistment of a few weeks, or if they have been enlisted, time off to train for the games, including a member of the Water Polo team who clinched their 27th straight SEA Games Gold medal last year. We wish all these sportsmen every success and hope that they continue to do well for Singapore in the Asian Games and beyond.  Besides these provisions, MINDEF has offered disruption to Full-time National Servicemen (NSFs) competing in these games. Very few have chosen to disrupt, perhaps because they are able to train adequately in the SAF. These many examples show that MINDEF has exercised flexibility towards sportsmen competing in team sports, a question asked by Dr Intan and Mr Muhamad Faisal and others. MINDEF has done so without transgressing the fundamentals of NS and still maintaining equity for all national servicemen. MINDEF will work with MCCY, SportSG and other relevant agencies through various pathways that can allow sportsmen to do well and still fulfil their NS obligations, be it in individual or team sports."
closing and expunging of police reports made by private parties against other private parties but not pursued,"Mr Kok Heng Leun asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether police reports made by private parties against other private parties are closed or expunged when no investigation of the allegations follows or when there is insufficient evidence to pursue an investigation; (b) if so, how long before they are closed or expunged; and (c) whether police reports containing unproven allegations are firewalled from ICA decisions in respect of the person's applications for social visit passes, student passes and work passes in accordance with the principle of ""innocent until proven guilty"".","Mr K Shanmugam: The Police will review Police reports to assess if an offence could have been committed, and whether further investigations are warranted. Where Police investigations are initiated, the facts of the case will be examined, and investigations conducted. Police reports and findings from investigations are retained. There are several good reasons for retaining the reports. For example, if there is a need to relook at what had happened, the records will be important.  Immigration facilities and Work Passes are assessed on the individual merits of the case. The factors taken into consideration include, among other things, criminal and security antecedents, if any. The NMP's question appears to be related to foreigners who apply for Short-Term Visit Passes, Work Passes, and Student's Passes. Foreigners have no absolute right to demand such immigration facilities in Singapore. It is for ICA and MOM to assess their eligibility for such facilities. Where a foreigner is being investigated in respect of a criminal offence, an application for an immigration facility, as mentioned by the NMP, will be held back, until the investigations are concluded. The investigations are obviously a relevant factor to consider. We assume that the NMP will not advocate that ICA or MOM grant an immigration pass to a foreigner who is being investigated (by way of an example) for committing a criminal offence like cheating people.  "
access to and privacy protection measures in place for street lighting cameras using facial recognition technology,Mr Leon Perera asked the Prime Minister in respect of planned installations of street lighting cameras using facial recognition technology (a) what measures are in place to ensure security and privacy protection; and (b) which Government agencies and what types of personnel within those agencies will have access to the data so generated.,"Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): Under the Smart Nation Sensor Platform project, the Government is progressively testing and deploying different sensors and related technologies, with the objective of providing better and more responsive services to citizens. These sensors include cameras mounted on street lamps that can support facial recognition for follow-up investigation in the event of a security incident. These cameras are similar to those already installed in other public places.To ensure security and protection of privacy, the Sensor Platform will incorporate industry best practices and standards in data security. These include access controls, encryption and identity hashing to prevent re-identification. Data collected from these sensors will only be accessed by public officers who require such data for their specific operational needs. The Public Sector Governance Act (PSGA), recently passed by Parliament, makes clear when data sharing is allowed across Government agencies, clarifies which agency is responsible, and criminalises the misuse of data."
proportion of full-time national servicemen downgraded for mental issues,Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for Defence whether there has been an uptrend in the proportion of full-time national servicemen downgraded for mental issues in recent cohorts compared to cohorts in previous decades.,"Dr Ng Eng Hen: Over the past five years, around 4% of each National Service (NS) cohort was downgraded for mental health issues. The majority of these were downgraded after the pre-enlistment check-ups, before commencing their NS and therefore the prevalence of mental disorders for national servicemen reflects that of the male population in Singapore.For those who are enlisted, the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) supports these Full-Time National Servicemen (NSFs) with a range of medical treatment and counselling services by our SAF psychiatrists, psychologists, counsellors and para-counsellors. Unit commanders undergo basic training to help them better understand mental health conditions and interview all NSFs at regular intervals to find out if they are facing any stresses, including emotional or psychological problems. In addition, NSFs can call a 24-hour SAF Counselling Hotline whenever they need help."
results of investigations into fatal accident near pasir ris mrt station on 22 march 2016 and tunnel flooding between bishan and braddell mrt stations on 7 and 8 october 2017,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is discovered in the investigations leading to the fines imposed on SMRT on 20 July 2018 in respect of the fatal accident near Pasir Ris MRT station on 22 March 2016 and the tunnel flooding incident between Bishan and Braddell MRT stations on 7 and 8 October 2017; (b) what lessons have been learned from the investigations; and (c) what measures have been put in place by SMRT to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: On 20 July 2018, the Land Transport Authority announced its intention to impose two financial penalties totalling $1.9 million on SMRT for the fatal accident which took place on 22 March 2016 near Pasir Ris MRT station, and the flooding incident in the tunnels between Bishan and Braddell MRT stations from 7 to 8 October 2017. SMRT has apologised and accepted responsibility for these incidents.Under the Rapid Transit Systems Act, following the imposition of financial penalties, SMRT has the right to lodge a statutory appeal to the Minister for Transport. As the appeal window has not closed, it would not be in order for the Minister for Transport to comment on this case now."
investigations into chairman and management of swiber holdings and related companies,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) has completed its investigation of the chairman and management of Swiber Holdings and its related companies; and (b) if so, whether CAD will proceed with any charges for any breach of the Securities and Futures Act or other offences.","Mr K Shanmugam: Police investigations into Swiber Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries are ongoing. Investigations of this nature require the careful review of a large volume of documents. It is inappropriate to comment further on the case, so as not to prejudice the investigation.  "
number of deaths from alcohol-related violence and traffic accidents in last 10 years,"Mr Kok Heng Leun asked the Minister for Home Affairs in the last 10 years, what is the number of deaths that have resulted from (i) alcohol-related violence and (ii) alcohol-related traffic accidents respectively.","Mr K Shanmugam: There were 10 deaths resulting from alcohol-related violence over the past 10 years. The number of deaths resulting from drink-driving accidents has fallen from 22 deaths in 2009 to 14 in 2017. On average, there were 16 such deaths per year.  The Police will continue to take tough action against alcohol-related offences."
plans to digitise current photocard driving licence,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether there are any plans by the Ministry to digitise the current photocard driving licence given that the provisional driving licence is now paperless.,Mr K Shanmugam: Traffic Police is similarly reviewing the digitisation of the qualified driving licence. More information will be released when the review is completed.
reported cases of investment scams targeting members of public,"Mr Ong Teng Koon asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) over the past three years, whether there is an increase in the number of reported cases of investment scams targeting members of the public; (b) what is the trend of the ratio of successful prosecuted cases versus reported cases over the same period; and (c) whether the Ministry has any plans to take a tougher stance to punish such investment scammers who defraud the public such as strengthening legislation to deter and punish such behaviour.","Mr K Shanmugam: From 2015 to 2017, the number of reported investment scams has doubled, from about 200 to over 400 cases a year. A key reason is the emergence of unregulated online investment platforms. These platforms allow trades across a wide range of products, such as currencies, shares, commodities and binary options. The public usually comes across such platforms via online advertisements, emails and unsolicited phone calls and messages. The operators of these online platforms are usually based outside Singapore, and payments are made directly to overseas bank accounts.Since 2015, the Commercial Affairs Department has charged 30 persons for their roles in 14 investment scams. The number of successfully prosecuted cases looks low compared to the number of Police reports. One of the reasons is that a significant proportion of investment scams today are committed remotely by syndicates operating in foreign countries, or the alleged investment assets, for example, distressed properties and agricultural products like seaweed farms, are overseas and difficult for Police to track down conclusively. Also, one investment scam may have multiple victims, resulting in many Police reports. Some losses alleged in reports are not due to scams, but the ups and downs of the market.A person who is convicted of a cheating offence under section 420 of the Penal Code may be liable for imprisonment of up to 10 years. MHA and MinLaw are reviewing the need to further strengthen our legislative levers against fraud offences, as part of the ongoing review of the Penal Code.Police will also continue to work closely with foreign law enforcement counterparts to crack down on overseas syndicates targeting Singaporeans. "
inspection regime for hdb facades,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for National Development while awaiting for the mandatory building facade inspection regime to be rolled out (a) whether interim inspections can be conducted on HDB facades with the same installation methods as those that fell off; and (b) whether the inspection regime can also be extended to newly built BTO HDB flats.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: In the design and construction of HDB flats, HDB ensures that all its buildings, including the external facade features, are designed and installed in accordance to approved Codes of Practice, the Building Control Act and Regulations, as well as other statutory requirements. Inspections are carried out during construction to ensure that works are completed in compliance with the requirements. In the case of claddings and fixtures, these installations are usually designed and supervised by a Specialist Qualified Person, who is a Professional Engineer and the plans must be approved by BCA. Once the buildings have obtained the Temporary Occupation Permit, building owners are required to ensure that the building exterior is maintained in a serviceable state under the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act. For HDB estates, Town Councils conduct regular inspections on the building facades as they are responsible for the maintenance of common property. Where necessary, they will engage a Professional Engineer to follow up on the repairs required.  The Periodic Facade Inspection (PFI) regime aims to enable early detection of tell-tale signs of deteriorating facade elements. It adopts a risk-based approach to balance enhanced safety against increased costs for building owners. This is why the PFI regime is scoped to focus on buildings above 20 years old, and excludes private landed houses, temporary buildings and low rise buildings.Notwithstanding the PFI regime, should any facade be dislodged from buildings, BCA will carry out an independent investigation on the incident to verify the cause of dislodgement. For HDB projects, HDB will also appoint an independent consultant to carry out checks on the HDB blocks with similar facade features to ensure there are no safety concerns. This is done regardless of the age of the building. "
ensuring good re-employment and age-friendly hiring practices by public service's outsourced providers,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Finance how does the Public Service ensure that its outsourced providers have good re-employment and age-friendly hiring practices.,"Mr Heng Swee Keat: The Government encourages all employers to have good re-employment and age-friendly hiring practices. This is achieved through broad-based measures that are available to all employers, including Government’s outsourced providers. For instance, the Special Employment Credit provides wage offsets to employers who hire older Singaporean workers aged 55 and above and earning up to $4,000 a month. An additional wage-offset of up to 3% of monthly wages encourages the employment of older workers above the re-employment age of 67. To facilitate age-friendly employment practices, companies can tap on the WorkPro Age Management Grant. The Government has also worked with tripartite partners on the Tripartite Standard on Age-friendly Workplace Practices to encourage employers to adopt age-friendly practices. These employers commit not to use age as a selection criterion in recruitment, and commit to engage employees on re-employment issues at least six months prior to the retirement age and subsequent extension of re-employment contract. The tripartite partners have also issued the Tripartite Guidelines on Re-employment of Older Employees which provides and calls on employers to adopt good practices in re-employment. In support of these efforts, the Government ensures that its tender specifications do not discriminate against outsourced workers in any industry based on factors such as age or gender. As the primary objective of procurement is to obtain goods and services, our specifications do not dictate the employment practices of service providers. Promoting good employment practices is better achieved through the measures described above. The Government will continue to review the relevance and effectiveness of our policies in this area."
statistics on awareness and practice of breast self-examination among females in singapore,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Health (a) whether there are any statistics about the awareness and practice of breast self-examination among females in Singapore; and (b) whether the Ministry will work with schools to educate students about breast self-examinations and do needful follow-up when necessary.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Breast cancer is the most common cancer among females in Singapore, and the risk of developing the disease rises with age. The Health Promotion Board (HPB) works with healthcare providers and community partners on awareness and public education efforts on breast self-examinations. For example, HPB partners the Breast Cancer Foundation and the Singapore Cancer Society on outreach activities during the Breast Cancer Awareness Month in October each year. An information booklet on breast self-examination is also available at all polyclinics. These efforts benefit females of all ages, including students. Previous surveys have found that approximately 45% of women in Singapore performed regular breast self-examinations1. Because the risk of breast cancer rises with age, HPB puts added emphasis on females of working age and beyond, rather than students. For example, it recommends that from the age of 30, females should do regular breast self-examinations. It also has efforts to encourage women 50 years old and above to go for regular mammogram screening once every two years."
provision of free digital tv starter kits,"Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for Communications and Information whether the scheme to provide free digital TV (DTV) starter kits to all HDB households without cable TV service penalises households that had gone digital early as they thought they did not qualify for the initial DTV Assistance Scheme, which was conditional, and have hence missed out on the current offer of a free DTV starter kit or a $100 voucher to offset the purchase of DTV equipment with no other conditions attached.","Mr S Iswaran: The original Digital TV (DTV) Assistance Scheme, launched in September 2014, was aimed at helping low-income households transit from analogue free-to-air (FTA) TV to DTV, by providing and installing DTV equipment for them for free.In April 2018, the Government expanded the DTV Assistance Scheme to help more Singaporean households move to DTV before analogue FTA TV ceases on 31 December 2018. The expanded Scheme is known as the DTV Starter Kit. It allows all Singaporean HDB households without a Pay TV subscription to redeem either DTV equipment with free installation, or a $100 voucher to offset the cost of purchasing selected DTV equipment. Singaporean households that have switched over to DTV on their own are not disadvantaged in any way because they can still enjoy the DTV Starter Kit by redeeming the DTV equipment for their TV sets (including as back-up) or for their secondary TV sets (if any), as long as they meet the eligibility criteria as stated above. Ultimately, our objective is to assist as many Singaporean households as possible to continue to enjoy FTA TV after 31 December 2018. "
solution to mynah nuisance along upper serangoon road,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for National Development whether AVA has found a solution to address the noise problem created by mynah birds along Upper Serangoon Road following persistent feedback from residents over the last 18 months.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: AVA has worked with NParks to prune the trees to discourage birds from roosting in the Upper Serangoon Road area. NParks will continue with regular tree pruning. AVA also conducted a trial to use lasers to disperse the birds in September 2017. However, the trial was unsuccessful in deterring the birds from roosting in the area. AVA is assessing other measures that can be deployed.   The public can also play a part by maintaining the overall cleanliness of the environment and not feeding wild birds. AVA and NEA will continue to work with the Jalan Besar Town Council to encourage residents not to litter or feed wild birds. Enforcement actions will be taken against those who do not comply. For instance, a recalcitrant feeder in the estate was recently sentenced in court and received a $450 fine for pigeon feeding. He had previously been fined on four occasions for similar offences."
average life expectancy of disabled persons receiving payouts under eldershield,Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the average life expectancy of disabled persons who received or are receiving payouts under ElderShield; and (b) what is the expected average life expectancy of persons who are able to claim and receive payouts under CareShield Life on the basis of their disabilities once the scheme comes into operation in 2020.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: As of 2017, the average duration of claim by ElderShield claimants is 2.8 years. About one-third of claimants have claimed for the full duration of five and six years for ElderShield 300 and ElderShield 400 respectively. Hence, the average duration of disability will be higher than the average duration of claim of 2.8 years.  The average life expectancy of Singaporeans who are severely disabled would likely increase in the future. Three in 10 severely disabled individuals are expected to remain in severe disability for 10 years or more. CareShield Life will provide payouts for as long as the policyholder remains severely disabled, which will provide Singaporeans greater assurance and better protection against their cost of long-term care."
safeguarding records and personal particulars against cyberattacks,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) what are the implications to the individuals whose personal particulars and other records are stolen during the recent cyberattack on SingHealth; and (b) what precautions can an individual take to prevent the stolen personal particulars and other details from being misused especially in the dark web.,14 Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Communications and Information when will the provisions in the Cybersecurity Act that deal with the duty of owners of criminal information infrastructure to give notice of cybersecurity incidents within a prescribed period come into operation.Mr S Iswaran: I thank the Members for their questions. I have addressed them in my Ministerial Statement at the 6 August 2018 Parliament sitting.
hospital admissions and deaths from alcohol overdose in last 10 years,Mr Kok Heng Leun asked the Minister for Health in the last 10 years (a) what is the number of hospital admissions for alcohol overdose; and (b) what is the number of deaths resulting from alcohol overdose.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Based on available public hospital data, between 2008 and 2017, the average number of hospital admissions per year for alcohol-related conditions, including alcohol intoxication was about 550 cases.  Separately, over the same time period, we have not had any deaths reported where alcohol intoxication is the primary cause of death. In this same period, an average of 14 deaths per year were caused by longer term effects of alcohol intake including deaths from acute alcoholic hepatitis and advanced alcoholic cirrhosis. "
education institutions in singapore for special needs youths aged 18 and above,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) whether there are education institutions in Singapore for special needs youths of age 18 and above and, if not, whether there are plans to set up such an institution; and (b) for those special needs youths who cannot find employment at that age, what options are available to them.","Mr Desmond Lee: Students with special educational needs (SEN) who graduate from mainstream secondary schools and Special Education (SPED) schools may apply for enrolment into Post-Secondary Education Institutions (PSEIs) (that is, junior colleges and centralised institutes, polytechnics and the Institute of Technical Education [ITE]) or specialised vocational training schools for further studies or vocational training.  Most of the students with a SEN diagnosis in mainstream schools, similar to their schoolmates, advance to the PSEIs every year. For those in SPED schools, a smaller proportion move to the PSEIs, given their need for more specialised and intensive support. Since 2014, SEN Support Offices have been set up in all polytechnics, ITE colleges, Autonomous Universities and arts institutions. These offices serve as a first-stop support unit for students to provide course counselling and access arrangements for students with SEN. They also administer funding support for students with physical or sensory impairment to purchase Assistive Technology devices and support services. The SEN Support Offices also collaborate with Voluntary Welfare Organisations to provide external support for students with SEN, such as internship placements and job matching. MOE will continue to work with the PSEIs and agencies such as SG Enable, to ensure that students receive sufficient support to continue with education and prepare for future employment.   For students with moderate to severe SEN, two schools, Metta School and Delta Senior School, offer vocational training leading to nationally-accredited certifications for students up to 21 years old. Each year, about 120 students with Intellectual Disability graduate with vocational certifications in a range of industry areas. These schools continually update their vocational programmes so that SPED students of diverse disabilities can be better prepared for employment. For SPED students who may not benefit from vocational certification but are capable of work, SG Enable works with SPED schools to support their transition into employment under the School-to-Work (S2W) Transition Programme. Students on the programme receive customised job training with job support from Job Coaches for up to one year post graduation to prepare them for eventual employment. About 30 students each year with diverse disabilities have benefitted from the S2W Transition Programme. The programme will be rolled out to all SPED schools serving secondary-level students by 2019. Other SPED students with heavier care needs may require closer supervision in their daily lives. They can be admitted into Sheltered Workshops or Day Activity Centres, depending on the level of care support required. Sheltered Workshops allows Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) to be engaged in completing straightforward tasks that are part of a simplified work process. Day Activity Centres provide long-term care services and equip PwDs with skills so that they can live as independently as possible within their homes and community. These centres provide therapeutic and behavioural intervention, training in interpersonal and community living skills, and support in activities of daily living."
elderly singaporeans without family support,"Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked the Minister for Social and Family Development with regard to the profile of elderly Singaporeans without family support (a) how many are currently totally reliant on support from the state and charitable organisations for survival; (b) how many have been abandoned overseas and in Singapore, in institutions of care; and (c) what are their gender, age group and ethnic profiles.","Mr Desmond Lee: Vulnerable elderly Singaporeans without family support may receive assistance for their basic needs under MSF's ComCare Long-Term Assistance and/or support in our Sheltered and Welfare homes.ComCare Long-Term Assistance helps persons who are unable to work due to old age, illness or disability, have limited or no means of income, and have little or no family support. They receive cash assistance for their basic living expenses, and assistance for medical and other needs. As at end-2017, there were over 3,300 persons aged 60 years and above receiving ComCare Long-Term Assistance. Over 60% of those assisted by ComCare Long-Term Assistance were males and more than 70% were aged 70 years and above. About 85% of these persons were Chinese, 8% were Malay, and 6% were Indian. Vulnerable seniors aged 60 years and above, with weak family support and no alternative accommodation arrangements are cared for in residential homes funded by MSF and operated by Voluntary Welfare Organisations. As at end-2017, there were slightly over 1,000 persons aged 60 years and above residing in these facilities. About eight out of 10 were males, and around half were 70 years old and above. Around 71% were Chinese, 17% were Malay and 11% were Indian.  We do not have data on seniors who have been abandoned overseas by their families."
coverage of singaporeans working in foreign diplomatic missions in singapore under employment act,Ms Tin Pei Ling asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether Singaporeans working in foreign diplomatic missions or embassies in Singapore are covered by the Employment Act; (b) whether Singaporeans working in such a setting can access the Employment Claims Tribunal; and (c) what support may be available to them when there are employment-related grievances.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: Singaporeans working in foreign diplomatic missions or embassies in Singapore continue to be covered under the Employment Act and have access to the Employment Claims Tribunals. We expect all employers to act in accordance with Singapore laws and regulations, and will take firm action to enforce compliance where there are breaches. While Singapore's obligations under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations may not allow us to apply the same range of measures to foreign diplomatic missions and embassies here, we will not hesitate to seek compliance through diplomatic efforts. Singaporeans working in such organisations can also approach the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management for assistance, such as mediation and advisory services, for employment-related disputes."
proportion of registered trade unions not initiating collective agreement negotiations with employers,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what proportion of registered trade unions have agreed with employers not to initiate collective agreement negotiations; and (b) how has this proportion changed over the past five years.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: There are about 1,700 unionised companies in Singapore, of which about two-thirds have registered Collective Agreements (CAs) with the Industrial Arbitration Court.A CA is a formal and enforceable agreement between the union and the employer on the affected employees' terms and conditions of employment. Whether or not a CA should be put in place is a matter for the union and employer to decide on mutually. In lieu of a CA, it is not uncommon to have less formal arrangements like a memorandum of understanding on areas of cooperation. This could be a more practical approach for some companies, for example, those with a small workforce.  "
verbal test option for singaporeans with low educational qualifications attending mandatory workplace safety courses,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what percentage of Singaporeans who attended mandatory workplace safety courses in the last year took verbal tests instead of written tests; and (b) whether the Ministry will allow workers to apply for the verbal test option themselves if they have low educational qualifications.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: Written tests for mandatory workplace safety courses are available in eight languages, so that language proficiency is not an obstacle to safety training. 48 locals, comprising 0.4% of those who attended mandatory workplace safety training in 2017 took verbal, rather than written tests. Workers who face difficulty in taking a written test can already apply to the Workplace Safety and Health Council for the verbal test option. There is no need for them to have first attempted a written test, before applying to be tested verbally. "
divorce cases awarded shared care and control of children,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Social and Family Development for each of the years from 2015 to date, what is the respective breakdown of the number and percentage of divorce cases where shared care and control of the children is awarded.","Mr Desmond Lee: There were 119 and 161 divorce cases where shared care and control was awarded in 2015 and 20161 respectively, which were 3.0% and 4.1% of the total number of divorces with care and control orders made for the respective years2."
aggregate monthly balances in ordinary accounts of cpf members for 2015-2017,"Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for Manpower what are the aggregate balances in the Ordinary Accounts of CPF members for the years 2015, 2016 and 2017 on a month-to-month basis.",Mrs Josephine Teo: CPF Board reports the aggregate CPF account balances on a quarterly and annual basis. Table 1 below shows the Net Ordinary Account balances of all CPF members between 2015 and 2017 on a quarterly basis.
update on revitalisation of shops scheme in rejuvenating hdb neighbourhood shops,"Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for National Development (a) if he can provide an update on the Revitalisation of Shops (ROS) scheme in rejuvenating HDB neighbourhood shops; (b) whether there are plans to get these shops to go digital and, if so, what is the progress in doing so; and (c) what are the Government's plans to help these retailers overcome challenges as more residents shop online and at larger shopping malls.","Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB heartland shops play an important role in serving the needs of residents, and HDB has put in place several measures to ensure that our neighbourhood centres remain relevant and vibrant places. First, new neighbourhood centres come with well-designed plazas and gardens to draw residents to these community spaces. Second, HDB curates the trade-mix to improve the vibrancy of the neighbourhood centres. Third, HDB has extended the enhanced Friendly Faces, Lively Places grant to HDB retailers and Merchant Associations (MAs) so that they can organise community and volunteer events to attract footfall. Fourth, HDB introduced the Revitalisation of Shops (ROS) Scheme in 2007 to help retailers and MAs enhance the vibrancy and competitiveness of HDB shops, through co-funding the upgrading of common areas and promotional events, and granting rent-free periods for tenants to renovate their shops. The subsidies provided under ROS were recently enhanced in May 2016. Since then, 17 sites have been announced under the seventh batch of the ROS. These include:(a) 13 sites which have applied for co-funding for upgrading of the common areas, of which, upgrading works at 3 sites have either commenced or will be commencing by October 2018. (b) 11 sites which have applied for co-funding for promotional events, have successfully organised events at the respective centres.In addition, to help our heartland businesses deal with the rising competition from e-commerce retailers and private shopping malls, the Retail Industry Transformation Map (ITM) was launched in 2016. A key strategy is to help local retailers integrate their e-commerce and digital marketing capabilities into their business models to reach out to more customers. Some assistance available to local retailers include: ·               The 12 SME Centres located island-wide, where advisors can guide SMEs in the use of digital technology to boost their productivity.·               The Retail Industry Digital Plan (IDP), launched by IMDA in partnership with Enterprise Singapore (ESG), provides SMEs step-by-step guidance on the use of digital technology at each stage of their growth.·               HDB and ESG are also working to encourage HDB retailers to become more competitive via the Productivity Solutions Grant (PSG), which supports the adoption of pre-scoped IT solutions in areas such as customer management, inventory tracking, and e-commerce.  To date, more than 300 retail SMEs have applied for PSG support, and this number is expected to increase in future.·               IMDA will expand the list of pre-approved solutions in e-commerce to help SME retailers develop and strengthen their online presence.  HDB retailers can also establish an online presence at no cost on HDB’s Where2Shop (W2S) website. To support these digitalisation efforts, HDB will be separately trialling free wireless internet service under Wireless@SG and a shopper traffic monitoring system at some of the HDB shopping complexes. The latter will allow HDB to collect data to gain insights on customer footfall and customer profiles, to help heartland retailers tweak their programmes and promotional deals to better meet the needs of shoppers. Kampung Admiralty and Oasis Terraces will be benefiting from these initiatives. In addition, MAs in our town and neighbourhood centres can tap on ROS to implement digital initiatives, including the installation of digital directories, wireless routers and footfall sensors."
cases of underaged domestic helpers for past five years and actions taken against errant agencies,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked ask the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the number of cases of underage domestic helpers for the past five years; (b) what are the actions taken against the errant agencies; and (c) what is the Ministry's plan to prevent underage domestic helpers working in Singapore.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: In the past five years, 130 Foreign Domestic Workers (FDWs) per year or six FDWs per 10,000 FDWs in Singapore were found to be younger than the age requirement of at least 23 years. MOM adopts a multi-layered approach to prevent underaged FDWs from working in Singapore. First, it is the responsibility of employment agencies (EAs) to ensure that the FDWs they have sourced meet the age requirement. The agencies are required to do upstream checks on the FDWs before they are deployed to Singapore. Action will be taken against EAs that fail to do so. Since 2013, MOM has taken action against over a hundred EAs. We meted out penalties ranging from warnings, demerit points and forfeiture of their security deposit, to prosecution for flagrant cases. Recently, two EAs were prosecuted and convicted, and fined the maximum $5,000 each. Their licences will also be revoked. In addition to these measures, MOM makes it a point to highlight the minimum age requirement to FDWs before their arrival in Singapore through the In-Principle Approval letter sent to all FDWs, as well as through the compulsory Settling-In Programme (SIP) for first-time FDWs. During the programme, FDWs are warned of the consequences they face should they be found to be underaged. They are also given the chance to come forward if they are under 23 years old. Those who own up are assured of passage home and they will be allowed back to Singapore to work after they turn 23. On top of these steps, MOM also conducts visual checks during the SIP and work pass card registration. FDWs who flout the minimum age requirement will be permanently debarred from working in Singapore. MOM urges employers to be vigilant of the FDWs' age. Putting their elderly or children in the care of an underaged FDW poses significant risks. Employers are advised to report to MOM if they suspect that their FDW is underaged. Lastly, as the passport remains the primary document for identification and age verification, it is important that the authorities in source countries step up efforts to improve the accuracy of their official documents. Therefore, when we uncover cases of FDWs with inaccurate ages, we will provide such information to source country Governments. "
special needs children of school-going age,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Education (a) how many special needs children of school-going age are there currently; (b) how many of these children are enrolled in a school; (c) whether schools with places for special needs children can be made more accessible in heartland locations; and (d) what is being done to ensure that each child has a place in a school appropriate for the child's specific needs.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: As at December 2017, there were 30,000 students with a reported Special Educational Need (SEN). About 80% of them are in mainstream schools and 20% are in Special Education (SPED) schools. Many children with SEN obtain a diagnosis during their pre-school years – usually at KKH and NUH Child Development Centres – and a majority of them benefit from early intervention.  Today, the 19 SPED schools are geographically spread across the island, with most SPED schools in heartland locations such as Ang Mo Kio, Hougang, Jurong West and Yishun. Three additional SPED school campuses have started operations this year and additional SPED school campuses are being planned.  Amongst the 19 SPED schools are those that focus on the needs of students with a specific disability profile, as well as those which serve a range of disabilities. For example, a student with moderate to severe cerebral palsy would attend the CPAS school, a student with moderate to severe Intellectual Disability as well as autism could attend a MINDS school and a student with multiple disabilities and autism could attend a Rainbow Centre school. Because the number of students with a specific SEN is not large, many are best served by central and specialised centres. This means that it may not always be possible to find a suitable SPED in the neighbourhood. Notwithstanding, over the years, we have made good progress towards ensuring that each child with SEN is able to attend a school that caters to his needs.   "
regular and comprehensive programme to fight prejudices and stigmatisation of mental well-being in secondary schools,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Education whether the Ministry will be planning a regular and comprehensive programme to fight prejudices and stigmatisation regarding mental well-being in secondary schools in light of the IMH-led study showing widespread negative perceptions of mental illness among teenage students.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: Negative perceptions of mental illness can stem from the lack of awareness and understanding of mental health. The IMH-led study also noted that majority of the students would reach out to, stand up for and support a classmate with mental illness, which is encouraging. Mental illnesses are caused by a variety of factors. To support students with mental illnesses, schools have been stepping up efforts to nurture the social and emotional competencies of our students, strengthen supportive school relationships, increase peer support efforts and encourage help-seeking behaviour. We work closely with parents and community partners to strengthen mental well-being and reduce the stigma for those suffering from mental illnesses.  MOE leverages the Character and Citizenship Education, school-based conversations and student learning resources to raise awareness and de-stigmatise mental illnesses. The Health Promotion Board also provides Mental Health Awareness Briefings and resources for school counsellors and teachers. This enhances their understanding of mental health, its impact on students as well as strategies on how to support these students better.  "
plans for animal rescue shelter for stray cats awaiting adoption,Mr Ong Teng Koon asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether there are plans to create an animal rescue shelter for stray cats who are awaiting adoption; and (b) whether there is funding available to house these stray cats in private shelters as they await adoption.,"Mr Lawrence Wong:  AVA works with 14 Animal Welfare Groups (AWGs) that take in and rehome animals. Nine operate their own shelters, including eight that have taken up or will be taking up tenancy at The Animal Lodge in Sungei Tengah. This was fully funded and built by Government as an option for AWGs whose premises were affected by development plans. There are also some AWGs that do not maintain a physical shelter, but work with fosterers to temporarily care for the animals before they are adopted. AVA will continue to work closely with AWGs to manage the stray animal population. Members of the public can also help by volunteering with them, helping with their fund-raising, or adopting animals. "
"ite, polytechnic and university graduates in 2015-2017 from normal technical, normal academic and express streams","Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Education what is the breakdown of the percentage of ITE, polytechnic and university graduates in 2015, 2016 and 2017 who are from the Normal Technical, Normal Academic and Express streams respectively.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: Over the last three years, among students who graduated from the ITE, close to half were from the Normal (Technical) [N(T)] course, about 45% were from the Normal (Academic) [N(A)] course, and the remaining were from the Express course. For those who graduated from publicly-funded diploma programmes, the figures were about 5% N(T), 35% N(A) and the remaining Express. For publicly-funded degree programmes, the numbers were about 1% N(T), 5% N(A) and the remaining Express.It should be noted that a good proportion of graduates from ITE and Polytechnics further their studies in publicly-funded institutes. We are also seeing University graduates attending ITE courses to gain hands-on skills. We must bear in mind that there must be different paths catering to the diverse strengths and talents of our people. "
"workers classified as managers and executives earning less than $2,500 and $2,600 a month as at 30 june 2018","Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Minister for Manpower as at 30 June 2018, what is the total number of workers, resident workers and Singaporean workers who are classified as managers and executives and earning a basic monthly salary of not more than (i) $2,500 and (ii) $2,600.","Mrs Josephine Teo: Based on the June 2017 Labour Force Survey, there are 26,000 employed residents who are Managers and Executives (M&Es) and earning a basic monthly salary up to $2,500 and 28,000 earning a basic monthly salary of up to $2,600.Over the last ten years, the share of M&Es earning below the Employment Act salary threshold has declined. In 2017, M&Es earning up to $2,600 constitute 1.5% of all employed residents compared to 10% in 2007. A significant 28% of such M&Es work part-time.Depending on the employer's own human resource practices, some M&Es who earn a basic monthly salary up to $2,500 are provided with overtime pay even if not required by law. "
adverse records given to foreign workers,Mr Kok Heng Leun asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what are the main ways in which adverse records are attached to a foreign worker; (b) whether unsubstantiated allegations by employers constitute such records; (c) how can a worker know whether there are adverse records attached to his name; and (d) what avenues are available to the foreign worker to clear his name.,Mrs Josephine Teo: A foreign worker may have an adverse record if he committed an offence under Singapore laws or was found to have infringed MOM's regulations. The Ministry does not place an adverse record based on unsubstantiated allegations by employers. The foreign worker would also have been given the opportunity to be heard if his employer alleged that he committed an offence.The worker would be aware of the offence he committed as enforcement actions would have been taken against him. He can appeal against the decision as provided for under the respective legislations. 
resolution of neighbour disputes over cigarette smoke,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Law with regard to neighbour disputes concerning cigarette smoke (a) whether mediation can be made compulsory for all involved parties; (b) whether there is any follow-up to ensure respondents continue to adhere to the terms of a settlement; and (c) for those who do not proceed with mediation, how are these disputes typically resolved.","Mr K Shanmugam: Community mediation is generally a voluntary process, and can be proceeded with only if both parties agree to mediate. For cases that do not proceed with mediation, the parties may end up resolving their issues through other informal means. For example:(a)                They have directly communicated with each other and arrived at a resolution; or(b)                Grassroots or community leaders have assisted the parties to hold a conversation that leads to a satisfactory outcome for them. However, for intractable cases where parties are unable to resolve their disputes by voluntary mediation or other informal means, the aggrieved party can file a case with the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals (CDRT) as a last resort. The CDRT judge can order the parties to attend mandatory mediation in the Courts or at the Community Mediation Centre (CMC), attend counselling or fix the case for hearing. Therefore, while community mediation is generally voluntary, an avenue of compulsory mediation does exist, and the failure to comply with the CDRT’s order to attend mediation may attract legal consequences. Where the CDRT judge, on hearing the parties, decides to make a Court Order, this order can entail the payment of damages, require a party to do or refrain from doing something (for example, take measures to prevent cigarette smoke from drifting into neighbouring units), or apologise. If a party breaches the Court Order, the other party can apply for a Special Direction to ensure compliance. A refusal to comply with a Special Direction may lead to, among other measures an Exclusion Order – this requires the non-compliant party to move out of his home.  Written settlements reached by parties through mediation at CMC are private contracts. These contracts are binding on both parties. The aggrieved party therefore has the option to enforce the agreement through civil proceedings. Alternatively, if the parties feel it may be useful, the CMC will offer parties another round of mediation at no further cost."
update on utilisation of adapt and grow programmes,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what has been the utilisation of the Adapt and Grow suite of programmes; (b) whether the number of professional conversion programmes and sectors involved will be further increased progressively so as to help more workers; and (c) whether the Career Support Programme has been successful in reaching out to older PMETs.,"Josephine Teo: In 2017, more than 25,000 locals found jobs through Adapt and Grow programmes and services, as compared to about 21,000 in 2016.The Ministry of Manpower and Workforce Singapore have ramped up on the number of Professional Conversion Programmes (PCPs) over the last two years to help mid-career PMETs reskill for new jobs or careers with good opportunities for progression. There are currently over 100 PCPs in about 30 sectors, which is approximately twice the number of PCPs a year ago. New PCPs for internal auditors, financial forensic professionals and consultants have been launched this year. We will continue to monitor demand, expand programme capacity and introduce new PCPs where appropriate, to provide more opportunities for mid-career jobseekers.In 2017, the Career Support Programme (CSP) was enhanced to provide higher salary support to employers who hire older PMETs who have been unemployed for at least 12 months. Over 1,100 PMETs were placed through CSP in 2017. Of these, more than 500 (46%) were aged 50 and above, almost three times higher than in 2016. We will press on with efforts to raise awareness of CSP among employers and older PMETs."
compensation for degree and non-degree holders in civil service,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Prime Minister whether the Civil Service pays non-degree holders the same compensation as degree holders for doing the same work, assuming all other factors being equal between the two types of employee.","Mr Chan Chun Sing (for the Prime Minister): Officers in the Civil Service are paid salaries that are pegged to market benchmarks and practices, taking into consideration their job roles and responsibilities. Within a job, the specific pay of officers would differ given differences in factors such as experience, skills and performance on the job. For candidates with no work experience at the point of recruitment, their starting salaries may be differentiated by qualification given that it is useful as a proxy for depth of knowledge and skill. However, once the officer is in service, his progression depends on his performance and potential and is independent of starting qualifications."
research conducted on awareness level of smoking-related health risks among singaporeans,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Health (a) whether research has been conducted to investigate the awareness level of smoking-related health risks among Singaporeans; and (b) what is being done to raise awareness of heart diseases and other health problems that can result from smoking.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: A 2016 study2 of awareness of the health risks of smoking found that 74 percent of Singaporeans surveyed were aware that smoking was associated with heart disease, 64 percent were aware of the association with stroke, 77 percent were aware that smoking was associated with mouth and throat cancer, and 82 percent were aware that smoking was associated with lung cancer.To raise awareness of the harms of smoking and to educate the next generation of Singaporeans, the Health Promotion Board’s (HPB) has several ongoing communication and education measures:(a) Systematic coverage of the harms of smoking in the school curriculum, supplemented by interactive programmes such as skits, to help dispel common misconceptions about smoking and equip youths with techniques to refuse cigarette offers;(b) Social media outreach to better engage young Singaporeans;(c) Talks and seminars at workplaces and in the uniformed services to reinforce messages for adults;(d) HealthHub.sg to make information on harms of tobacco easily accessible online;(e) Graphic health warnings on all tobacco products to remind both smokers and non-smokers of the harms of tobacco use. Graphic health warnings have been mandatory since 2003, and are refreshed every few years. Many smoking-related ailments, including heart disease, have been featured.This year, HPB will conduct a new public education campaign to encourage Singaporeans to live a tobacco-free lifestyle. The campaign will continue to emphasise the harms of addiction and tobacco use. MOH has also recently conducted a public consultation on the introduction of standardised packaging of tobacco products in conjunction with enhanced graphic health warnings. We have received many submissions, and are in the process of evaluating the responses received.HPB’s communication and education efforts are part of a multi-pronged approach on tobacco control, that includes legislation to control tobacco advertising and the minimum legal age for tobacco use, fiscal measures to reduce affordability, and provision of smoking cessation support."
after-arrest mental healthcare provided for mental illness cases,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Home Affairs what after-arrest mental health care is provided to people with mental illnesses involved in incidents resulting in their arrest.,"Mr K Shanmugam: After arrest, where the Police are aware that a person is mentally ill, the Police will arrange for a trained volunteer to be with the mentally ill person during interviews with the investigation officer.By the end of 2018, the Police intend to pilot the Home Team Community Assistance and Referral Scheme (HT CARES) at a Land Division, inter alia, for arrested persons who need treatment for mental illnesses. Under the scheme, social workers contracted by the Police (known as CARES officers) will work with the offender to identify underlying issues that could have led to the commission of the offence. We will study the effectiveness of this pilot, before deciding on the next steps. More details will be released later."
breakdown of new hires for graduate roles in public service and civil service from 2013 to 2017,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Prime Minister what is the breakdown of new hires for graduate roles in the public service and civil service for each of the past five years according to graduates from local autonomous universities, local private educational institutes and overseas universities.","Mr Chan Chun Sing (for Prime Minister): Between 2013 and 2017, the Civil Service1 hired an average of about 2,800 officers per year for roles at or above the entry-level grade for fresh graduates. Of these new hires, an average of 65% were from local autonomous universities, 4% were from local private educational institutes and 24% were from overseas universities. The remaining were non-graduates."
standardisation of starting salary for moh scholars across all its healthcare clusters,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the starting salary for the Ministry's scholars is standardised across all its healthcare clusters; (b) if not, why is that so; and (c) what are the reasons for the salary discrepancy.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: The starting salaries for graduates on Ministry of Health Holdings (MOHH) scholarships are standardised within a range across the public healthcare institutions. The public healthcare institutions will determine the exact starting salary for each MOHH scholar within the range, based on factors such as their level of qualification and relevant working experience."
update on current status of malaysia-singapore high-speed rail project,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the current status of the Malaysia-Singapore High-Speed Rail project; (b) what costs is Singapore incurring while waiting for a more definite conclusion; (c) how will local companies and employees involved in the project be affected by the postponement; and (d) what is being done to ensure a favourable outcome.,Mr Khaw Boon Wan: I thank the Member for her questions. I have addressed them in my reply at the 9 July 2018 Parliament sitting.
new citizens relinquishing their citizenship in past 20 years,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what cumulative absolute number of new citizens over the past 20 years have relinquished their citizenship; and (b) whether the number of such cases has been increasing or decreasing annually over the past 10 years.,"Mr K Shanmugam: A total of 5,400 naturalised Singapore citizens renounced their citizenship between 1998 and 2017, an average of about 270 each year. Over the past 10 years, the annual renunciation rate for naturalised citizens has remained stable and low, at around 0.1%. "
annual breakdown on approval of foreign manpower request for companies not meeting minimum salary or quota requirements,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Manpower in each of the past five years (a) how many companies have had their foreign manpower requests approved despite not meeting the minimum salary or quota requirements; (b) what criteria are used to determine when such exceptions are to be made; and (c) how does the Ministry ensure that such companies do not gain an unfair competitive advantage over other companies who have not been granted similar exceptions.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: Our foreign manpower policy is designed to support a vibrant and innovative economy. Conditions for work pass applications are consistently applied. However, where economic agencies have assessed the need to provide additional support to meet specific objectives, we also need to exercise flexibility.  In deciding whether an enterprise merits such flexibility, MOM relies on the assessment of economic agencies like EDB, EnterpriseSG and IMDA. Examples of cases where flexibility can be considered include the following:(a) Under the Lean Enterprise Development (LED) Scheme, an enterprise implements a productivity enhancing project that would ultimately make it more manpower-lean. The employer has to hire temporary staff so that it can properly introduce a new system while being able to meet its operational needs using the existing system and manpower. However, during the transition, the additional staff would cause it to exceed the prevailing Dependency Ratio Ceiling (DRC).(b) Under the Capability Transfer Programme (CTP), an enterprise needs the help of foreign specialists to support the implementation of improved technologies or processes and build up the local team. However, while these specialists have the required expertise, they may not meet all the conditions of work pass applications e.g. salary requirements.(c) Early-stage start-ups usually structure their pay packages as a combination of salary and non-cash remuneration such as stock options, for both local and foreign hires. The salary component alone may not be sufficient to meet the prevailing Employment Pass (EP) salary criteria but the presence of these start-ups adds to our economic dynamism.  In the past five years, an average of 400 enterprises were provided with such enterprise-level flexibility at any one time, constituting 0.5% of all employers of work pass holders. To ensure a level playing field, the same considerations are consistently applied to any enterprise that is able to provide similar justifications."
tracking of students who drop out of secondary education,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Education (a) whether the Ministry tracks the number of students who drop out of secondary education; (b) what are the reasons for these students not continuing their education; (c) what is the length of the absentee period before schools take action and reach out to the absent students and their families; and (d) what measures does the Ministry take to ensure such students return to school.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: The proportion of the Primary One cohort that did not complete secondary education has fallen from 4% in 2000 to less than 1% currently. This is due to the concerted effort of schools, agencies and community partners.The reasons for dropping out are usually a combination of factors, including personal and family circumstances, desire to work rather than study, negative peer influence outside of school, lack of motivation to learn and difficulties coping with their studies.Teachers in schools mark students’ attendance daily. Schools have systems in place to promptly notify parents and check on the students when they are absent without valid reasons. Active steps are also taken to engage students who display irregular attendance, including counselling, parent engagement and home visits.Since 2009, schools have implemented the Time Out Programme to provide enhanced guidance and support for disengaged students, to help them overcome the difficulties that have kept them away from school. Additional support is provided by School Counsellors and Student Welfare Officers who support students in addressing their emotional and behavioural issues and work closely with the family and other community partners to encourage them to return to school. Besides school-based solutions, MOE also taps on the expertise of our partners, such as Social Service Offices, Family Service Centres, Self-Help Groups and Voluntary Welfare Organisations. For example, students who drop out of school are referred to the Enhanced STEP-UP Programme set up by the Ministry of Social and Family Development. Under this programme, VWOs engage out-of-school youths and their families, to encourage the youths to re-engage their schools and community again."
cpf account withdrawals and cancellations by singaporeans and permanent residents,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how many Singaporeans and permanent residents (PRs), in terms of numbers and percentages respectively, did not apply to withdraw $5,000 or more from their CPF accounts upon reaching the age of 55; (b) how many have left more than the minimum sum required in their CPF accounts; and (c) how many PRs have withdrawn and cancelled their CPF accounts, in terms of number and percentage of the total number of PRs, for the past 10 and 20 years respectively.","Mrs Josephine Teo: As of end 2017, 42% of those who turned age 55 in 2016 did not withdraw any CPF monies within a year of their 55th birthday. This includes the first $5,000 from the Ordinary and Special Accounts (OA and SA) which members can withdraw unconditionally, monies above their cohort Full Retirement Sum, as well as monies above Basic Retirement Sum which can be withdrawn using property charge or pledge. For those who did withdraw, the majority, about 6 in 10 members, withdrew up to $5,000.For the same cohort, about 53% of active members met their Full Retirement Sum in cash and pledge at age 55 in 2016 (i.e., able to set aside the Full Retirement Sum fully in cash, or met Basic Retirement Sum in cash and provided sufficient property pledge or charge). Of this group, about 5 in 10 left additional funds in their CPF Ordinary or Special Accounts. Based on our observations, members do so because they have no immediate need of the money, or they wish to take advantage of the higher CPF risk-free interest rates.From 2013 to 2017, an annual average of 13,500 CPF members, or 0.4% of total CPF members, withdrew their CPF monies when they left Singapore. This includes former Singapore Citizens (SC), former Permanent Residents (PR) and foreigners who contributed to the CPF before 2003. Former SC and PR members can leave their monies in the CPF after they have given up their Singapore citizenship or permanent residency. CPFB does not track the number of former SC and PR members who choose to retain their monies in the CPF. "
regulation to ensure deletion of personal data collected by obike,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Communications and Information how can the authorities ensure the deletion of personal data collected by oBike in compliance of the Personal Data Protection Act especially since it claims to have around 1 million members.,"Mr S Iswaran: oBike, like any other business in Singapore, is required to comply with the data protection obligations under the Personal Data Protection Act (“PDPA”). If a business has no legal or business purpose for the personal data in its possession or control, the PDPA requires it to stop retaining such data.The PDPA continues to apply to a company undergoing liquidation. Where a liquidator is appointed, the liquidator will also have to ensure that the company undergoing liquidation continues to comply with the PDPA. This includes the obligations to protect customer data during liquidation and expunging customer data at the end of the winding-up process if there is no legal or business purpose to retain it.The personal data of customers in Singapore cannot be treated as assets and sold without their consent. In winding up a company, the company’s liquidator may sell the whole or part of the company, its assets, or business. If such a sale takes place, customer data that is directly relevant to the transaction may be transferred to the acquirer. However, under the PDPA, customers must be notified that their personal data has been transferred. If customers do not wish for the acquiring company to use their personal data, they can approach the acquiring company to withdraw their consent, whereupon the acquiring company shall then delete the personal data once there is no legal or business purpose to retain it.The Personal Data Protection Commission (“PDPC”) expects oBike and its liquidators to continue complying with the PDPA even as it prepares to exit the market in Singapore. PDPC has reminded oBike of its obligations under the PDPA, and is monitoring the situation closely. PDPC will not hesitate to take further action to safeguard consumers’ interests if necessary."
average annual electricity consumption for commercial buildings from 2013 to 2017,"Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) for the past five years, what has been the average annual electricity consumption for commercial buildings; (b) what is the standard air-conditioned temperature in these buildings; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider having a campaign to encourage companies to turn up the temperature to reduce electricity consumption and reduce carbon footprint.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M:  The average annual electricity consumption of commercial buildings from 2012 to 2016 was around 6,276 GWh per year. The energy use intensity (EUI), which is the total annual electricity consumption per unit floor area, for commercial buildings improved by 7% from 2012 to 2016.Users of air-conditioning are encouraged to set their indoor temperatures at around 25 degrees Celsius. The Building and Construction Authority’s (BCA) Green Mark scheme, which certifies environmentally sustainable buildings, awards points for buildings whose indoor temperature is set at 24 to 26 degrees Celsius and relative humidity at <65%, for the comfort of occupants.Buildings contribute up to a quarter of Singapore’s carbon emissions. The “greening” of buildings is necessary if Singapore is to continue developing sustainably and meet our international climate change commitments. BCA leads the government’s climate change mitigation efforts for the building sector, and their third Green Building Masterplan is focused on changing the way building tenants and occupants consume energy.  As part of our efforts in the Year of Climate Action, my Ministry will work with BCA on programmes to encourage owners and tenants of commercial buildings to reduce energy consumption and lower their carbon footprint."
free live broadcasts of world cup 2018 in singapore,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) whether live broadcasts of World Cup 2018 will be made available in Singapore for free; (b) if so, where can the public access these broadcasts; (c) whether more free televised matches can be made available beyond the nine key matches; and (d) whether the Ministry is able to work with commercial sponsors to make future international sports events available for free broadcasts.","Mr S Iswaran: All sixty-four FIFA World Cup 2018 matches will be screened for free across various public venues such as community centres and the Singapore Sports Hub. An estimated 100,000 members of the public have already enjoyed these free screenings.Nine FIFA World Cup 2018 matches are also being broadcast “live” on Mediacorp’s Okto channel for free. Six of these matches have already been broadcast, as will the two Semi-Finals and the Final in the coming days.It is becoming more challenging to provide such “live” broadcasts of international sports events for free. Broadcast rights for international sports events such as the FIFA World Cup are commercially negotiated. Over the years, the cost of these broadcast rights has grown significantly. For the FIFA World Cup 2018, broadcasters in the region paid an estimated 25% to 75% more this year compared to 2014. Broadcasters find it difficult to recoup the escalating cost of broadcast rights, because there are other options for viewers to watch such sports events “live”. Hence, commercial sponsorship is important and we welcome more sponsors to partner our broadcasters to make “live” broadcasts of such international sports events more accessible to Singaporean viewers."
provisions for candidates with medical certificate to resit primary school leaving examination,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Education (a) whether provisions can be made for candidates to resit the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) when they have a medical certificate which deems them medically unfit to sit for the examination; and (b) whether this can be done without retaining the student for another year.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: Candidates who have been certified to be medically unfit to sit for the PSLE will not need to resit the examination as there are methods which allow us to assess the students’ attainment levels.Candidates who are absent from a subject at the PSLE with valid reason(s) will be given a projected T-score for the subject. The projected T-score takes into consideration the candidate's performance in that subject in school, his/her peers' performance in the subject in school and national examinations.If the candidate is absent for the entire PSLE, a PSLE aggregate score would similarly be projected for the candidate using the same approach. He/she will not be required to resit the PSLE."
statistics on stamp duty and property tax collected from purchase and sale of properties from 2015 to 2017,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked asked the Minister for Finance how much stamp duty and property tax has been collected from the purchase and sale of properties in the first five months of this year and what is the percentage of increase year to year for the past three years.,"Mr Heng Swee Keat: The Singapore Department of Statistics publishes monthly data on the Government’s operating revenue, including data on stamp duty and property tax collection.Stamp duty is payable on instruments which effect a transfer of interest in properties, and stocks or shares in Singapore. In the first five months of 2018, we have collected about $2.2 billion in stamp duty. The percentage changes in stamp duty collection are: -6.2% in 2015, +14.2% in 2016 and +45.9% in 2017. Stamp duty from property transactions made up the vast majority of total stamp duty collection.Property tax is payable annually for property ownership. In the first five months of 2018, we have collected about $2.2 billion in property tax. The percentage changes in property tax collection are: +4.2% in 2015, -1.3% in 2016 and +0.4% in 2017."
breakdown on disbursement of agriculture productivity fund to companies,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for National Development (a) how much of the Agriculture Productivity Fund has been disbursed to date; (b) how many companies have received funding support from the Fund; (c) how much of the financial disbursement has been to locally-owned enterprises; and (d) how many of these disbursements are related to indoor/vertical farming.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Over $13 million has been awarded to 74 farms from the Agriculture Productivity Fund (APF) to date, of which over $7 million has been disbursed. Local enterprises received more than 90% of the funding disbursed. 14 of the farms are vertical or indoor farms. The AVA account managers will continue to facilitate the farmers’ efforts to transform their operations with the APF’s support."
withdrawal of hospitalisation and surgical insurance scheme by statutory boards,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Prime Minister with the withdrawal of the hospitalisation and surgical insurance scheme by some statutory boards (a) whether the Ministry is aware that officers previously on this scheme who have pre-existing medical conditions can only get insurance cover under MediShield Life at Class C and B2 levels and that these officers are unable to buy a rider or upgrade for their medical insurance policies; and (b) whether the Ministry can negotiate with insurance companies to offer a comprehensive coverage for all civil servants, especially those with pre-existing illnesses who had better coverage before the withdrawal.","Mr Chan Chun Sing (for the Prime Minister): Public officers who joined the Service after 1994 are placed on the Medisave-cum-Subsidised Outpatient (MSO) scheme. This is a portable medical benefit scheme which provides 2% of an officer’s monthly salary as additional Medisave contributions, in lieu of hospitalisation benefits, and an annual subsidy of $500 for outpatient treatments. Under the MSO scheme, an officer may receive an additional Medisave contribution of up to $2,730 annually1. The MSO scheme is regularly reviewed to ensure it remains market competitive. In the last review in 2015, the Civil Service increased additional Medisave contributions from 1% to 2%.All Singaporeans are covered under MediShield Life. On top of that, public officers can use their additional Medisave contributions to purchase Integrated Shield Plans (IPs) to supplement their MediShield Life coverage. In addition, the Public Service Division (PSD) has also appointed a panel of insurance companies to offer portable IPs at discounted premiums to public officers and their dependants. These IPs are individual contracts between the officers and insurers, and will continue to cover officers even after they change employers.Over and above the MSO scheme benefits, and PSD’s facilitation for public officers and their dependants to take up portable IPs at discounted premiums, one particular Statutory Board (SB) had further arranged for its officers to be covered under a Group Hospitalisation and Surgical (H&S) plan. This is even though there is no obligation to do so. Under H&S plan, the insurance is not portable and will not cover officers after they leave the SB. The H&S plan of the SB expired in Dec 2017. The SB is working to arrange for an insurer to offer H&S coverage to its officers."
impact of grab-uber proposed takeover,"Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Transport following the Grab-Uber proposed takeover (a) whether many people will be out of a job as a result of this deal; (b) if so, how many people will be so affected and what is being done to help these workers; and (c) what is the impact of this on the overall public transport service.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan:  The Grab-Uber merger impacted several groups of workers and drivers, but to different degrees. First, about 300 former employees of Uber were given paid leave of up to three months while Grab identifies suitable positions for them. Those who are not placed within Grab will be compensated in accordance with the Tripartite Advisory on Managing Excess Manpower and Responsible Retrenchment.Second, Uber used to have 300 to 400 contract workers. Grab has committed to take over and honour the terms and durations of their contractsThird, Uber had about 10,000 drivers driving exclusively for it at the point of merger. More than 9,000 of the affected Uber drivers have since joined Grab. For those who do not, Workforce Singapore and the NTUC’s Employment and Employability Institute are helping them secure new employment. MOM and LTA are also working with the National Private Hire Vehicles Association (NHPVA) and National Taxi Association (NTA) to help them resolve any outstanding payments or contractual disputes with Uber.The point-to-point transport sector is still evolving. The industry is not yet at its steady state. The Ministry of Transport and LTA are monitoring the development and will intervene as necessary, including instituting a fair regulatory framework to ensure that it stays open and contestable, so that no one single market player can dominate the industry to the detriment of commuters and drivers."
educational levels attained by prison inmates,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Home Affairs for each of the past three years, what is the breakdown of the educational level attained of persons entering the Drug Rehabilitation Centres, the Long-Term Imprisonment 1 and the Long-Term Imprisonment 2 regimes respectively.","Mr K Shanmugam: The tables below show the breakdown of DRC, LT1 and LT2 inmates by educational level attained, as declared by inmates upon admission."
recruits to saf volunteer corp,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked the Minister for Defence (a) what is the total number of recruits to the SAF Volunteer Corp since its inception; (b) what is the ratio of male to female recruits; (c) what is the current dropout rate and what are these cases due; and (d) whether there will be any review of the programme and training based on the observations and feedback thus far.,"Dr Ng Eng Hen:  Since the Singapore Armed Forces Volunteer Corps (SAFVC) was launched in October 2014, more than 700 SAFVC Volunteers (SVs) have been carefully selected, out of over 2,700 applications received. We are also heartened by the strong commitment and enthusiasm shown by our SVs, with a low drop-out rate of 3%. The reasons cited for dropping out were mainly due to being unable to meet the medical and training requirements. Our pool of SVs comprises a good balance of males and females, with over 40% being females. The high number of interested females is heartening, and many of them have excelled. SV1 Nur Fadilah Bte Judir is one example. SV1 Fadilah had joined the SAFVC to better understand and appreciate what male Singaporeans go through to defend Singapore. Through her SAFVC training and subsequent deployment as an Auxiliary Security Trooper, she was able to develop the necessary skills and knowledge to contribute to national defence.MINDEF/SAF has continually looked at ways to enhance the SAFVC scheme, to better achieve its objectives of allowing more Singaporeans and Permanent Residents to contribute to national defence, show support for National Service, and deepen their understanding and ownership of national defence. SVs are deployed alongside national servicemen and regulars to support the SAF’s operations and training, and the SAFVC’s training is regularly reviewed to ensure that it is safe, progressive, and effective. From this year, SVs, along with all MINDEF/SAF personnel, will also participate in the Counter-Terrorism (CT) Community Response Module (CRM) as part of their training. This new module will equip SVs with the knowledge and skills to aid others and support first responders in the event of a terrorist attack.The SAFVC has also expanded the range and scale of deployment opportunities for SVs, to provide more avenues for their participation. For instance, more SVs are now deployed to support key national and SAF events, such as the National Day Parade, Army Open House and the RSAF50@Heartlands exhibition. This year, MINDEF/SAF has launched 15 new roles for SVs, to allow more SVs to contribute to national defence in more areas of interest and expertise such as Safety, Counselling, Music, Engineering and Supply Chain. Along with the introduction of the new roles, SVs will also be equipped with the required skills to carry out their duties effectively."
smes' share of 4.5% overall labour productivity growth in 2017,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) how much of the overall labour productivity growth of 4.5 per cent in 2017 was attributable to our SMEs; and (b) what is the productivity performance of SMEs in the respective sectors.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing:  In 2017, overall labour productivity, as measured by real value-added (VA) per actual hour worked (AHW), rose by 4.5%. Due to data collection constraints, data on real VA per AHW by firms’ SME and non-SME status are not available. The Government also measures labour productivity in terms of real VA per worker. In 2017, real VA per worker in the overall economy increased by 3.8%. Based on MTI’s estimates, SMEs recorded slightly lower real VA per worker growth of 3.2% in 2017. A breakdown of SMEs’ productivity performance by sectors is not available.  The Government has put in place several initiatives to support SMEs in raising their productivity. Across all sectors, SMEs can approach any of the 12 SME Centres for free business advisory services. The SME Centres collectively engage over 20,000 businesses each year through advisory sessions, capability workshops and outreach events. The number of SMEs that embarked on capability development projects with support from the SME Centres almost doubled from 600 in 2013 to 1,100 in 2017. SMEs can also approach experts at the two Productivity Centres for assistance in productivity solutions. The Singapore Innovation and Productivity Institute focuses on manufacturing, engineering, logistics and related industries, while the Singapore Productivity Centre focuses on the retail, food services and hotel sectors. SMEs can also leverage technology and digital solutions to raise productivity through schemes like the $110 million Productivity Solutions Grant (PSG) for pre-scoped equipment and IT solutions. On top of these broad-based efforts, the Government works with industry and unions to foster improvements in Productivity, Jobs & Skills, Innovation, and Trade & Internationalisation within and across 23 key sectors, through the Industry Transformation Maps. JTC also works with industry to develop high-rise Innovative Facilities with shared services that help SMEs in the same value chain improve their land productivity and streamline production processes for higher labour productivity.Our industry partners play an instrumental role in driving these productivity efforts. Trade Associations and Chambers (TACs) can spearhead industry-level initiatives, aggregate the needs of their members, and coordinate the deployment of solutions. To support our TACs across all sectors in these endeavours, Enterprise Singapore co-funds up to 70% of supportable costs through the $115 million Local Enterprise and Association Development (LEAD) programme."
root cause of fire in pulau busing and measures in place to handle such emergencies,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is the root cause of the fire at Pulau Busing; (b) whether it could have been prevented; and (c) whether there are suitable capabilities on the island itself for handling such emergencies or is there a need to mobilise emergency resources from the mainland.,"Mr K Shanmugam:  Investigations into the oil storage tank fire at Pulau Busing are on-going. Preliminary findings indicate that the fire was caused by a lightning strike on the rooftop of the tank.The Fire Code requires oil storage tanks to have a lightning protection system. The SCDF is investigating why the system seemed to have failed in this case.The first responders to the fire were the company’s Company Emergency Response Team, also known as CERT, stationed on Pulau Busing itself. Under the Fire Safety Act, companies storing more than five metric tonnes of petroleum and flammable materials are required to form a CERT. CERT members are trained in fire-fighting, rescue and first aid and are the first responders to fight the fire, before SCDF arrives. Companies are also required to provide a suite of fire-fighting systems and equipment. These include fixed and mobile fire-fighting monitors, foam-pouring protection systems, and water pumps. These regulatory measures helped to contain the Pulau Busing fire. The CERT managed to prevent the spread of the fire before SCDF arrived. During the fire, other companies on neighbouring islands also provided resources to help fight the fire. This is part of the industry-led Emergency Mutual Aid scheme. This was a large-scale fire and SCDF had to mount a complex operation to prevent the fire from spreading to adjacent oil tanks, and to extinguish it. The SCDF deployed 128 SCDF personnel, and 48 firefighting and support vehicles. Special large monitors that discharge 23,000 litres of foam solution per minute were deployed to fight the fire. Specific fire appliances to cool the adjacent oil tanks were also deployed. The fire was extinguished only after six hours."
incidents of vehicles with objects not properly secured and falling off onto roads,Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is the number of incidents of vehicles with objects not properly secured and falling off onto the roads in the past three years; (b) how many of such occurrences resulted in an accident; (c) how does LTA track such incidents and accidents; and (d) what are the measures to reduce such cases from occurring.,"Mr K Shanmugam: Between 2015 and 2017, Traffic Police (TP) enforced against 248 instances of drivers who failed to properly secure the loads on their vehicles. Of these, heavy vehicles accounted for 80%.In the same period, 13 accidents occurred due to vehicle loads falling onto the road, 11 of which involved heavy vehicles.To deter motorists from driving with unsecured loads, TP conducts regular enforcement operations, particularly along roads used by heavy vehicles. Offenders are liable for composition fines of up to $180 and up to six demerit points.TP also regularly engages heavy vehicle fleet-owners and drivers, through road-safety dialogues. TP uses these dialogues to share and encourage the adoption of best practices, including those related to securing loads on vehicles.In addition, the Workplace Safety and Health Council (WSHC) has issued advisories, such as the “Workplace Safety and Health Guidelines on Safe Loading of Vehicles”. Among other things, these advisories provide guidance on proper loading techniques for different types of cargo.  "
rectification works by or kim peow contractors for faulty construction of viaduct structure linking pie and tpe at upper changi road east,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Transport whether Or Kim Peow Contractors will be responsible for (i) the carrying out of all the rectification works required by LTA arising from any faulty construction of the viaduct structure linking PIE and TPE at Upper Changi Road East and (ii) all the additional cost arising from the rectification works required and surveys carried out on behalf of LTA.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan:  LTA has reached an agreement with Or Kim Peow Construction Pte Ltd (OKP) to terminate the contract to construct the viaduct from TPE towards PIE (Tuas) and Upper Changi Road East, including the recovery of appropriate costs from OKP. LTA will engage a new contractor to complete the construction of the viaduct, including the rectification of any structures which are deemed unsafe by the independent Professional Engineer appointed by LTA. The project timeline and completion date will be reviewed, after the award of the new contract."
increasing subsidy rates under community health assist scheme for non-pioneer generation seniors above 60 years of age,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry asked the Minister for Health whether the Government will consider increasing the subsidy rates under the Community Health Assist Scheme for non-Pioneer Generation seniors above the age of 60 as their levels of retirement adequacy is considerably lower than younger Singaporeans.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong:  The Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) was launched in 2012. The Ministry reviews CHAS regularly to ensure that the scheme continues to meet the objective of providing Singaporeans with access to affordable and quality primary care in the community. For example, in 2014 and 2015, we increased the number of chronic conditions covered under CHAS.We will continue to review the Scheme regularly and will take into account feedback from the Member.  "
payment of sg bonus,"Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Finance (a) whether the date for the payment of SG Bonus has been determined; and (b) whether details on receiving the SG Bonus by eligible Singaporeans have been finalised and, if so, when will the announcement be made.","Mr Heng Swee Keat:  SG Bonus will be disbursed to all adult Singaporeans at the end of the year. Individual letters and SMS notifications will be sent in October 2018 to inform citizens about the amount of SG Bonus they will be receiving, and the payment dates.Citizens who have registered for PayNow and linked their NRIC to their bank account can also receive their payout earlier via PayNow, compared to those being paid through direct bank crediting or cheques.  "
plans for polyclinic within mrt station in vicinity of potong pasir,"Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for Health whether there are plans to operate a polyclinic within one MRT station from the vicinity of Potong Pasir and, if there are, where will it be located.","Mr Gan Kim Yong:  MOH will be developing a new Polyclinic – Kallang Polyclinic – in the Kallang-Balestier area.The new polyclinic will be located adjacent to Kwong Wai Shiu Hospital. It is within walking distance from Boon Keng MRT station, and one MRT stop from Potong Pasir MRT station."
detrainment of passengers in bukit panjang lrt breakdown,Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for Transport (a) how is the detrainment of passengers carried out when there is a Bukit Panjang LRT breakdown; (b) what are the measures taken to ensure passenger safety during detrainment; and (c) whether there is a need to strengthen the detrainment process.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan:  Detrainment procedures are designed to ensure the safety of passengers and are similar across all our rail lines. During a breakdown, the first priority for any operator is to resolve the fault and resume service quickly, so that passengers can alight at the platform. If this cannot be done, passengers may need to be detrained to the tracks.During any detrainment, the safety of passengers is the key consideration. Prior to detrainment, train services must be halted and traction power switched off in the affected zone. Passengers will be informed through in-train announcements that a detrainment is necessary, and that assistance is on its way. Customer Service Officers (CSOs) will be dispatched to the affected train to guide passengers to the nearest station safely. Before exiting the train, the CSOs will brief passengers on how to detrain safely, including how to exit the train cabin and where to walk on the emergency walkway in order to avoid trackside equipment. Any passengers with special needs, such as those on wheelchairs, will also be assisted by the CSOs, with the help of fellow passengers. The current detrainment process is safe and has worked well so far. LTA monitors and reviews how our Public Transport Operators (PTOs) respond to each train disruption. The lessons learnt are used to continuously improve incident management plans, including the detrainment process. The PTOs also conduct regular exercises to ensure that staff are operationally ready to manage a detrainment."
security deposit or performance bond by shared bicycle operators to ensure protection of deposits or pre-payment made by bicycle hirers or consumers,Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for Transport whether LTA will require shared bicycle operators to place a security deposit or performance bond to ensure that deposits or any pre-payment made by bicycle hirers or consumers are protected.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan:  LTA will study the need for bicycle-sharing operators (BSOs) to place a security deposit or performance bond if there are BSOs which require user deposits when the licensing regime is implemented from October this year. Currently, seven BSOs have applied for licences. None of them require user deposits. A number of them are existing BSOs who even under the light touch approach adopted today do not require user deposits. To facilitate the growth of this nascent industry and ensure that bicycle sharing services remain affordable, LTA has refrained from over-regulating BSOs as this can increase their compliance costs, which could in turn be passed on to users. The licensing regime is primarily targeted at minimising disamenities to the public caused by the indiscriminate parking of shared bicycles. To be licensed, BSOs must put forward a responsible and sustainable bicycle management plan to operate in our local context.  Going forward, LTA will monitor and strengthen the licensing regime as necessary, as well as work with relevant organisations such as the Personal Data Protection Commission, the Consumers Association of Singapore, National Parks and the Town Councils on public education and outreach, so as to strike the right balance between the viability of the industry and the interests of users and the general public."
language assistance for candidates more proficient in own vernacular languages for private hire car driver's vocational licence test,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for Transport whether language assistance can be arranged for candidates who are more proficient in their respective vernacular languages for the Private Hire Car Driver's Vocational Licence (PDVL) test while retaining a minimum proficiency requirement in the English language.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan:  The provision of chauffeured services puts drivers in contact with a wide range of commuters every day. Hence, private hire car (PHC) and taxi drivers must be able to speak simple English to communicate effectively with all commuters – both Singaporeans and tourists. Drivers must also be able to read basic English, so that they can navigate roads and buildings, the names of which are primarily in English.  Nonetheless, we understand that there are Private Hire Car Driver’s Vocational Licence (PDVL) applicants who may have language difficulties. If they wish to look for other jobs or transit to other industries, they can approach e2i or Workforce Singapore for employment assistance. For those who would still like to drive PHCs, and who require assistance in preparing for their PDVL tests, they can sign up for remedial classes conducted by the training providers – the Singapore Taxi Academy (STA) and ComfortDelGro (CDG) Taxi. Based on feedback, we understand that these have been useful in helping applicants pass their tests. LTA will also work with the training providers to ensure that language assistance is available to applicants who require them."
effectiveness of enforcement on designated parking for shared bicycles,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Transport how effective has enforcement of designated parking for shared bicycles been and what further measures will be taken to prevent shared bicycles creating inconveniences to other path users.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan:  We know that indiscriminate bicycle parking is a major issue on the ground. LTA has stepped up enforcement efforts and has issued more than 3,300 removal notices to date.To more effectively address the issue, LTA will implement a licensing regime for bicycle-sharing operators by end 2018. This will allow LTA to manage the size of each operator’s fleet, require operators to manage indiscriminate parking and encourage responsible user behaviour. Under the licensing regime, operators will be required to implement QR code geo-fencing and impose a penalty on users who do not park within the designated areas. Users who repeatedly park improperly will be banned temporarily from renting shared bicycles from all operators.   Apart from regulatory measures, LTA has worked with the operators on a public awareness campaign to educate users on responsible parking. More parking spaces will also be added to cater to a growing number of cyclists."
regulating monopolistic private-hire car market,"Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Transport on the merger between Grab and Uber (a) how does the Government intend to regulate a monopolistic market for private-hire cars; (b) what will be the impact to consumers, drivers and Singapore's transportation landscape as a whole; and (c) whether the Government will expedite the regulatory framework to control the growth of private-hire cars.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Over the last three years, private hire cars (PHCs) have emerged as an important point-to-point mode of transport for Singaporeans. To protect the interests of commuters and drivers, the Land Transport Authority is reviewing the regulatory framework for the point-to-point sector to ensure that the PHC industry remains open and contestable. This framework will be announced later this year.  In the meantime, the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) has issued the Proposed Infringement Decision (PID) to Grab and Uber, which includes proposed remedies to restore market contestability in the point-to-point transport sector. The CCCS is currently seeking public comments on whether any of the remedies proposed are sufficient to address the identified competition concerns."
one-off exemption for motorcycles manufactured between 1993 and 2003 under classic vehicles scheme,Mr Ong Teng Koon asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry will consider allowing motorcycles manufactured between 1993 and 2003 to be given a one-off exemption to register under the classic vehicles scheme.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan:  The Classic Vehicle Scheme (CVS) allows individuals to own cars and motorcycles which are of heritage value to Singapore.To qualify, the vehicle must be at least 35 years old from its original registration date. Vehicles registered under the CVS can only be used on the roads for up to 45 days a year. Motorcycles registered between 1993 and 2003 are currently 15 to 25 years old, which is way below the minimum requirement of 35 years for the CVS. Hence, we have no plans to grant any exemption for them to be registered under the CVS."
construction of longer tunnels for residents to nearest mrt stations,Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for Transport whether LTA will consider constructing longer tunnels to provide a better sheltered link for residents to their nearest MRT stations.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan:  Underground tunnels cost substantially more than at-grade sheltered walkways, and may involve a lot more disruptive diversion works in mature estates. At-grade sheltered walkways are also more inclusive, as they provide cover to all footpath users, not just MRT commuters. Under the Walk2Ride programme, more than 200km of at-grade sheltered walkways will be built by the end of this year."
"educational qualifications of 54,000 private-hire car drivers","Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Minister for Transport whether he can provide a breakdown of the educational qualifications (primary, secondary, junior college, ITE, diploma, degree, masters and higher) of the 54,000 private-hire car drivers in Singapore.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan:  Of the 54,000 private hire car (PHC) drivers as of 31 March 2018, about 40% have attained tertiary / post-secondary level qualifications, including degree, diploma and ITE qualifications. The highest qualification attained by another 40% of drivers is secondary school level qualifications. The remaining 20% have attained primary school level qualifications or other qualifications, such as the Singapore Workforce Skills Qualifications, as their highest qualification."
raising minimum age requirement for private-hire car drivers to that for taxi drivers,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Transport whether any new considerations have surfaced for the Ministry to consider raising the minimum age requirement for private-hire car drivers to that required for taxi drivers to better ensure the safety of passengers.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan:  Where safety is concerned, we are of the view that the number of years of driving experience is more important than age. In this regard, LTA requires a minimum of two years’ driving experience for applicants for the Private Hire Car Driver’s Vocational Licence (PDVL)."
infrastructure support to ensure uninterrupted business transactions and daily digital operations from power and technical breakdowns,"Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for Trade and Industry as Singapore gears up to be ""Smart Nation"" ready (a) what is the infrastructure support available to ensure that business transactions and daily digital operations are not affected when there is a power or technical breakdown such as the recent CBD power outage; and (b) whether there are plans to identify skill sets and put in place standard operating procedures to ensure workers are equipped with the skills and know-how to prevent similar incidents.","Mr Chan Chun Sing:  The Government recognises the importance of reliable and secure infrastructure, both in terms of power and telecommunication systems, as Singapore gears up for increasing digital operations as a “Smart Nation”.On the power system front, SP Power Grid (SPPG), the national grid operator, has a comprehensive infrastructure planning and maintenance regime to increase system reliability and minimise disruptions. This includes building in redundancy for critical components, continuous monitoring of the transmission network, and conducting preventive maintenance. Workers are trained and reminded to adhere strictly to operating procedures. That said, there can still be the occasional instance of human error, such as during the blackout on 1 June 2018. We have adopted a calibrated risk-based approach in systems planning, with a framework in place to enable quick restoration of power when needed. This calibrated risk-based approach has served us well, with our power system being among the most reliable in the world. For instance, from FY13 to FY17, Singapore’s average annual disruption per consumer ranged from 12 seconds to 45 seconds, compared to latest FY15 figures of 4 minutes for Tokyo and 23.4 minutes for Hong Kong.For telecommunication infrastructure, MCI and IMDA have also put in place measures to ensure resilience. These include Codes of Practices that set baseline requirements to ensure that our telecommunication networks are fit for purpose and on par with international best practices, as well as to encourage telecommunication operators to adopt more advanced resilience practices. IMDA also engages the telecommunication operators regularly to conduct exercises on recovering from service disruptions, and discuss initiatives to enhance the resilience of our networks.Telecommunication service disruptions sometimes occur due to cable cuts committed by errant contractors. MCI and IMDA have therefore put in place several measures to mitigate the risk of such disruptions. For example, the Telecommunications Act requires contractors to employ licensed Telecommunication Cable Detection Workers to detect the presence of underground cables prior to commencing earthworks. In addition, IMDA holds regular dialogue sessions with contractors to encourage the adoption of precautionary measures when carrying out earthworks, as well as the need for training for workers. Where disruption to telecommunication services occurs due to cable cuts, IMDA will not hesitate to enforce any breaches of the Telecommunications Act by prosecuting the relevant parties in Court. MTI and EMA also have similar measures in place for earthwork damage to electricity cables, and these are enforced through the Electricity Act, relevant Code of Practices and licensing conditions.To minimise the impact on consumers in the event of disruptions, IMDA incentivises telecommunication licensees to restore services quickly by imposing penalties that will take into account the duration of the disruption, amongst other factors. IMDA also prescribes baseline requirements for key telecommunication licensees’ business continuity planning to facilitate recovery during service disruptions"
review of requests for airbnb-type facilities,"Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry will be reviewing requests for Airbnb-type facilities and, if so, how and what will be the criteria for the regulation and monitoring of the industry and its enforcement.","Mr Lawrence Wong:  The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) is currently conducting a consultation exercise to seek the public’s views on a proposed regulatory framework for the use of private homes as short-term accommodation (STA).Under this framework, URA proposes to establish a new use category for STA under the Planning Act. URA will assess the eligibility of a property for STA use by considering factors such as its location and surrounding uses. For strata-titled developments such as condominiums, STA use will only be allowed if there is support of at least 80 per cent in share value.  The framework proposes several measures to mitigate the potential dis-amenities arising from STA. These include an annual 90-day cap on STA use, an occupancy cap of six persons per home, and submission of STA guests’ details as part of the registration process. All STA units will also need to comply with fire safety regulations.In addition, we are studying the possibility of regulating STA platforms through a licensing framework. This means that platform operators will be required to obtain a licence to advertise any STA activities in Singapore. URA will work with relevant government agencies to review the feedback obtained through the ongoing consultation exercise, before finalising the regulatory framework for STA."
waiver of resale levy for senior citizen applicants aged 55 and above for 2-room flexi flats,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development whether HDB can consider not to impose a resale levy on applicants of 2-room flexi flats who are senior citizens aged 55 years and above.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Singapore Citizen households enjoy a significant housing subsidy when they buy a new flat from HDB or a resale flat from the open market with a CPF housing grant. If they purchase another flat from HDB, they are no longer eligible for the full subsidy, which is meant for first-timers only. Hence a resale levy is imposed if they are not a first-timer.Nonetheless, we have put in place various measures to help seniors who purchase a 2-room Flexi flat from HDB. Since 2015, we have waived the accrued interest for seniors liable for the percentage resale levy2. For those who purchase a short lease 2-room Flexi flat, we provide further help by capping their resale levy and adjusting it for the shorter lease. This means that the maximum resale levy that would be paid on a 2-room Flexi with a 45-year lease is $18,000, much lower than what the normal resale levy would be.We will continue to review our policies to ensure that they maintain a fair allocation of public housing subsidies between first-time buyers and other buyers."
successful applicants for hdb rental flat awaiting vacant unit,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the current number of families that are successful in their application for a HDB rental flat but are awaiting a vacant unit; (b) whether there has been an improvement in the waiting period for vacant rental flats; and (c) what is the targeted number of rental flat tenants that will be placed under the Fresh Start Housing Scheme within the next three years.,"Mr Lawrence Wong:  There are currently about 450 families who were successful in their application and are waiting to be allocated a public rental flat. At this juncture, families can be allocated a rental flat in about 2 months from the time of their application, if they are not particular about location. This has fallen significantly from a peak of 21 months in 2008. Some waiting time is inevitable as HDB needs to assess each application. The allocation of rental flats is also subject to considerations such as the household’s locational preferences, the quotas under the Ethnic Integration Policy, and the setting aside of vacant flats to house existing tenants whose rental blocks are due for redevelopment.The Fresh Start Housing Scheme was launched in December 2016 to help second-timer families with young children living in public rental housing to own a home again. As of May 2018, 70 households have been emplaced on the scheme. While we do not have a target, we will continue to work with all eligible families who are keen on homeownership, and hope to see another 100 households emplaced in the next 3 years."
calculation of published data for singapore's gini coefficient measuring income inequality,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) whether published data for Singapore's Gini coefficient measuring income inequality includes both employer and employee CPF in the definition of income; and (b) if it does, what will be the latest Gini coefficient data if CPF income is excluded.","Mr Chan Chun Sing: The Gini coefficient published by the Department of Statistics (DOS) is computed based on household income from work. Both employer and employee CPF contributions are included in the definition of household income from work. This is because CPF contributions are a significant component of compensation from work, and can be used by households for housing, healthcare and investment purposes. Nonetheless, DOS also publishes a Gini coefficient that excludes employer CPF contributions from household income from work.Both Gini coefficients are available on DOS’ website. In 2017, the Gini coefficient which includes employer CPF contributions was 0.459, while the Gini coefficient which excludes employer CPF contributions was 0.468. The former is lower because there is a cap on employer CPF contributions for employees who have reached the wage ceiling of $6,000.DOS does not publish a Gini coefficient that excludes both employer and employee CPF contributions from household income from work."
extending lease buyback scheme to 5-room hdb flats,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry asked the Minister for National Development whether HDB will consider extending the lease buyback scheme to 5-room HDB flats given the current difficulty some residents face in selling their flats in mature estates.,"Mr Lawrence Wong:  The Lease Buyback Scheme (LBS) was first introduced in 2009 as a monetisation scheme for low-income elderly living in 3-room or smaller flats, as these households have limited monetisation options compared to households in larger flat types. With the extension to 4-room flats in 2015, many more households are now eligible.Elderly households in 5-room flats currently have several monetisation options. They can either rent out a room, or the entire flat and move in with their family members. They can also right-size to a smaller flat. If they right-size to a 2- or 3-room flat, they may also apply for the Silver Housing Bonus.MND and HDB are committed to providing elderly flat owners with various monetisation options to suit their retirement needs. We will continue to monitor the situation and consider the need to extend existing monetisation schemes."
outcome of ava's proposals to prevent mass roosting of mynahs on trees in front of bukit timah plaza,Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for National Development what is the outcome of AVA's proposals to prevent the mass roosting of mynahs on trees in front of Bukit Timah Plaza and to reduce the incessant noise created by the birds during the wee hours of the morning and in the evening.,"Mr Lawrence Wong:  AVA has worked with NParks to address the noise nuisance caused by mynahs roosting in trees around Bukit Timah Plaza. NParks has increased the frequency of tree pruning since 2017, and this has improved the situation. AVA also conducted a trial using a bird deterrent chemical on the trees in the area in the second half of 2017. However, the chemical was not effective in deterring mynahs from roosting. AVA is assessing other measures that can be deployed in this area. The public can also play a part by maintaining the overall cleanliness of the environment and not feeding wild birds. Enforcement actions will be taken against those who do not comply."
installation of cctvs in multi-storey carparks and lifts,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for National Development whether HDB can install CCTVs in its multi-storey carparks and the lifts serving the carpark to deter crime and those who smoke in the lifts.,"Mr Lawrence Wong:  The Singapore Police Force (SPF) works closely with HDB and Town Councils to ensure and enhance security in public housing estates. Currently, HDB Multi-Storey Car Parks (MSCPs) have Police cameras installed at strategic locations such as lift lobbies, entrances and staircases. These cameras have proven to be effective in helping to deter crime. HDB will install CCTVs in existing MSCP lifts, where necessary.As for smoking in lifts, the National Environment Agency (NEA) takes a serious view towards smoking violations, and NEA officers are deployed to investigate and enforce against smoking violations. Ultimately, residents must also do their part and be considerate by not smoking in the lifts."
sold and unsold two-room hdb flexi flats,"Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for National Development as of June 2018, what is the number and percentage of 2-room flexi flats that are (i) unsold including those under construction (ii) sold under a 99-year leasehold and (iii) sold under 15 to 45 year leaseholds.","Mr Lawrence Wong: As at May 2018, 15,200 2-room Flexi flats have been offered for sale since HDB introduced such flats in August 2015. This comprises 1,900 (13%) unsold flats, 7,000 (46%) sold under 99-year leases3 , and 6,300 (41%) sold under 15- to 45-year leases."
effectiveness of deployment of recycling bins to hdb blocks under enhanced national recycling programme,Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether the deployment of recycling bins to HDB blocks under the enhanced National Recycling Programme has been effective since it was implemented in 2011; (b) whether the Ministry enforces checks to ensure that the bins are returned to their designated spots after the waste have been collected; and (c) whether technology such as geo-fencing can be deployed to ensure that these bins are not inevitably moved or relocated.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M:  The National Recycling Programme (NRP) was launched in 2001 to complement the efforts of the informal recycling sector. Since then, the National Environment Agency (NEA) has enhanced the NRP to make it more convenient for residents to recycle. For example, from 2011, one blue recycling bin is provided for every HDB block, an increase from one for every five blocks.These efforts have contributed to an increase in the recyclables collected under the NRP, from 25,300 tonnes in 2011 to 44,400 tonnes in 2017. A survey conducted in 2015/2016 also showed that among residents who recycle, 9 in 10 use the NRP blue bins. While we have made progress on this front, we can do more to make recycling a part of daily living for all Singaporeans. Our recycling rates have not caught up with our increased consumption and purchasing habits, with Singapore’s domestic recycling rate hovering at around 20 percent since 2012. We encourage Singaporeans to recycle more and make sustainable living choices so as to lower our carbon footprint.The Government will continue to facilitate recycling. For example, all new HDB developments will provide dual chutes for refuse and recyclables, to make it more convenient for residents to recycle. From 1 April 2018, new non-landed private residential developments taller than four storeys are similarly required to be equipped with dual chutes. We will also require existing condominiums to provide one recycling bin per block from 1 August 2018. Everyone must also play their part to segregate their waste and utilise the recycling facilities provided. More importantly, let us all be gracious and not waste the efforts of our fellow Singaporeans by contaminating recycling bins with food or liquid waste.Public Waste Collectors (PWCs) are required to return recycling bins to their designated locations after collection. NEA conducts spot-checks to ensure that recycling bins are at their designated locations. From the second half of 2018, starting with the public waste collection contract for the Pasir Ris-Bedok sector, NEA will introduce a new requirement for PWCs to mark the locations of the recycling bins on the floor. Members of the public who find recycling bins outside the demarcated area should inform NEA, which will then conduct investigations and penalise the respective PWC if they are found liable for the breach. NEA is also conducting a trial using side-loader trucks which have mechanised arms that will empty recycling bins to load recyclables in the truck. As part of this trial, the existing blue recycling bins will be replaced with new bins which are larger and more difficult to move. This will reduce the likelihood of unauthorised movement of the bins.We will continue to monitor the effectiveness of these measures, before deciding if further measures, such as geo-fencing, are necessary."
increasing penalties for pollution of water resources with toxic industrial waste,"Mr Yee Chia Hsing asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether the Ministry will consider increasing the penalties for pollution of our water resources with toxic industrial waste, especially for recalcitrant offenders.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M:  My Ministry takes any pollution of our water resources very seriously as it directly affects the environment as well as the quality of our water sources. Two-thirds of Singapore is water catchment area and raw water collected there is meant to be treated into potable water. Meanwhile, the used water collected in our public sewerage system is largely treated and reclaimed for NEWater.To safeguard our water resources and the environment, both PUB and the National Environment Agency (NEA) require Written Approvals or Written Permissions to be obtained prior to the discharge of trade effluent into public sewerage systems, or into watercourses and onto land, respectively. As part of the Written Approvals or Written Permissions, companies must comply with the relevant provisions under the Sewerage and Drainage Act (SDA) or Environment Protection and Management Act (EPMA) and their respective regulations when they discharge their trade effluent. These include the requirement to install pre-treatment facilities, to provide sampling test points as well as to comply strictly with the discharge limits for specified substances.   Under the SDA and EPMA, where trade effluent is discharged into the public sewers without a Written Approval or into drains or land without a Written Permission, the offender could be fined up to $20,000 with a further fine not exceeding $1,000 per day if the offence continues after conviction. Similar penalties apply if the discharge is not in accordance with the conditions of the Written Approval or Permission. Under the SDA, if the trade effluent discharged into the public sewers contains dangerous or hazardous substances, a fine of up to $50,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both can be imposed on first-time offenders. For repeat offenders, the maximum fine will be doubled to $100,000. The maximum penalties are further increased to $200,000 or to a jail term not exceeding 2 years should the illegal discharge cause injury or death to any person or disrupt the water reclamation processes. Similarly, under the EPMA, any person who discharges any toxic or hazardous substance into inland water so as to be likely to cause pollution of the environment would be liable to a fine of up to $50,000 or to imprisonment for a term up to 12 months or to both. The EPMA also provides for heavier penalties for repeat offenders.Both PUB and NEA also have the powers to require an offender to immediately cease any process or work that produces toxic, dangerous or hazardous substance or trade effluent that contains such substances. The offender may also be ordered by the Court to restore the public sewerage system to its original condition, or ordered by NEA to remove and clean up the toxic substance from the drain or land.We take a serious view of keeping the watercourses and sewers free from pollution and will not hesitate to take enforcement action. We will continue to monitor the effectiveness of our regulatory regimes in safeguarding our water resources and review the penalties, if necessary."
ensuring comparable food prices at hawker stalls and coffee shops in new hdb estates vs-a-vis those in mature estates,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources what can the Ministry do to ensure that the food prices at hawker centres and coffee shops in new estates such as Sengkang, Tampines and Sembawang are comparable to those in matured estates as shown in the Makan Index.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M:  The Makan Index, developed by the Institute of Policy Studies, is based on the average prices of five food types observed at selected hawker centres, food courts and coffee shops. The Government does not regulate the prices of food sold in coffee shops, food courts or hawker centres.  Nevertheless, my Ministry ensures that affordable food options are available at all our hawker centres, including those in new estates. To moderate stall rentals and prevent rent-seeking behaviour, my Ministry has disallowed the subletting of stalls. We have also removed the reserve rent in our monthly stall tender exercises. This means that even if the bidding price for these vacant stalls is below market price, the National Environment Agency (NEA) will allocate the vacant stall to the highest bidder as long as there are competitive bids. About 40% of cooked food stalls have been awarded at bids that are below 85% of the assessed market rent.To assist stall holders with rising manpower costs, we are deploying productivity measures, such as centralised dishwashing, automated tray return, e-payment options, and kitchen automation in our hawker centres. These initiatives will reduce the workload of the hawkers and allow them to focus on food preparation and cooking, especially during peak hours. In addition, NEA has approved more than a hundred applications (worth about $214,000) since the Hawkers’ Productivity Grant was launched in October 2017 to assist hawkers adopt stall-level productivity measures. Those who have benefited from the grant have given feedback that the equipment helps to reduce food preparation time significantly. The availability of numerous stalls allows consumers to compare food prices and take into account affordability in their purchase decisions at hawker centres. This also helps to moderate the increase in food prices.We are committed to upholding the role of hawker centres as community dining rooms in both mature and new estates so that Singaporeans from all walks of life can enjoy food at affordable prices. We announced in 2015 that 20 new hawker centres with approximately 800 stalls will be built by 2027. Some of these new hawker centres will be located in new towns such as Sengkang, Tampines and Sembawang. The managing agents appointed to run these new centres will be required to provide affordable food options. An example is Hawker Centre @ Our Tampines Hub (OTH), where hawkers selling local food offer at least one meal option priced at $2.80 or less."
update on 2016 pilot study of releasing bacteria-carrying mosquitoes into environment,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether he can provide an update on the 2016 pilot study of releasing bacteria-carrying mosquitoes into the environment.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M:  The National Environment Agency (NEA) is evaluating the use of male Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti mosquitoes (Wolbachia-Aedes) to further suppress the Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in the community. Phase 1 field study was conducted at three selected sites at Braddell Heights, Tampines West and Nee Soon East from October 2016 to December 2017. The study had met its objectives and demonstrated that the released male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes had successfully competed with urban male mosquitoes and mated with some female mosquitoes. The releases led to 50% suppression of the urban Aedes aegypti mosquito population at the study sites.The field study surfaced two challenges posed by Singapore’s high-density and high-rise landscape. First, NEA discovered that mosquitoes moved from surrounding areas into the study sites, thus reducing the impact of Wolbachia-Aedes in the sites. Second, NEA found higher Aedes aegypti mosquito densities at high floors of some blocks, as insufficient numbers of male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes had reached those floors. To address the high-density and high-rise challenges, NEA is carrying out Phase 2 field study from April 2018 to January 2019. Phase 2 field study will improve the release methodologies to distribute the male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes to where they are needed. NEA will release Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitos at same Phase 1 study sites at Tampines West and Nee Soon East and their extended areas. Phase 2 field study is an important and necessary step for NEA to refine the release methodologies and address the unique challenges faced due to our urban landscape, in preparation for the subsequent suppression trial.NEA will continue to engage residents and stakeholders. The co-operation and support from residents and local stakeholders were crucial in ensuring the success of Phase 1 study. Residents and local stakeholders are encouraged to continue supporting NEA in Phase 2 field study. Residents are also encouraged to continue carrying out mosquito control procedures and the 5-step Mozzie Wipeout.  "
measures to help students better understand socio-economic opportunities in southeast asia,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Education how is the Ministry helping students to better understand the social-economic opportunities in South East Asia with a view towards helping them thrive in an economically important region in the longer term.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung:  Given the opportunities in Southeast Asia, it is useful for students to develop a good understanding of the region. Students will also benefit from establishing networks within the region early. To raise awareness and understanding of the region, students are introduced to ASEAN in primary school. Through the Social Studies curriculum, students will learn about the cultural and economic ties member countries share with one another. In secondary school, students can offer subjects such as Economics, Geography, History, and Social Studies, which include a deeper understanding of the region. Through Economics, Geography and History at the pre-university level, students learn about the economic and trade policies of Southeast Asian countries, trends in regional economic developments, as well as economic integration through ASEAN.Students extend their understanding of Southeast Asia through ASEAN-themed forums and seminars. They observe ongoing economic developments and expand their understanding of the region when they undertake overseas trips to Southeast Asian countries. In addition, our student-athletes also forge friendships with their fellow athletes from the different Southeast Asian countries through the ASEAN Schools Games.Our Institutions of Higher Learning organize immersion programmes, student exchanges with institutions in the region, and overseas internships. Students also perform community projects in rural areas in the region. For many years, our institutions also take in a small proportion of students from ASEAN countries. While in Singapore, they forge bonds with Singaporean students and enrich the higher education experience.   "
air quality in vicinity after fires at pulau busing and kranji in march 2018,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources following the fires at Pulau Busing and Kranji in March 2018 (a) whether these fires have affected the air quality in the vicinity; and (b) what is the procedure for activation of the NEA team to monitor air or water quality following a major fire involving hazardous products.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M:  NEA monitors air quality in Singapore through a network of real-time monitoring stations. Besides monitoring key air pollutants such as sulphur dioxide and fine particulate matter (PM2.5), these stations also monitor Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). VOCs are often associated with the handling and combustion of fuel oil.In the event of major fires, in addition to SCDF being activated, NEA officers will be deployed to monitor air and water quality in the vicinity of the affected premises during and after the incident.In the case of the Pulau Busing fire on 20 March 2018, the fire occurred at an oil storage tank operated by M/s PB Tankers Ltd. NEA officers monitored the ambient air quality and meteorological conditions while SCDF and the Company’s Emergency Response Team (CERT) were fighting the fire. The prevailing winds then were blowing from the northeast and the air quality was in the “Good to Moderate” range, with no spikes in the PM2.5, sulphur dioxide, VOCs, and other air pollutant levels. The firefighting water was contained within the bund of the affected oil storage tank and the coastal water quality around Pulau Busing was not affected.As for the fire incident that occurred at No.11 Kranji Crescent on 22 March 2018, NEA officers monitored air and water quality near the affected premises during and after the incident, and did not detect any spikes in the air or water pollutant levels."
measures to assess and ensure children continue to uphold relevant oriental core and family values,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Education how will the Ministry assess regularly and ensure that our children continue to uphold relevant oriental core values and family values such as filial piety, care for the elderly and savings habits that have made Singapore what it is today.","Mr Ong Ye Kung:  As part of our national curriculum, schools emphasise the values of respect, resilience, responsibility, integrity, care and harmony in classroom lessons, through co-curricular activities and experiential activities like the Values in Action (VIA) programme. Topics such as filial piety, caring for others and importance of saving are covered in subjects such as Character and Citizenship Education (CCE).Schools also work with parents and the community in reinforcing values education. Schools encourage parents to build on what is taught in schools at home. Schools also work with community partners for students to live out the core values through age-appropriate experiential learning. By engaging with the elderly through VIA for example, students better understand their needs and the role they can play to make a difference.Schools review their programs regularly on the effectiveness of the curriculum in inculcating values. The Ministry also conducts regular reviews and improve on the syllabuses and pedagogical approaches in teaching values through the various subject areas. Home and community efforts coupled with what is taught in schools will maximise our students’ ability to internalise the values taught and demonstrate them in their daily lives."
status in 2028 of motorcycles registered before 2003 under lta's classic vehicle scheme,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether all motorcycles registered before 2003 and of at least 35 years old by 2028 will be allowed to continue under LTA's Classic Vehicle Scheme.,"Masagos Zulkifli B M M:  All motorcycles registered before 1 July 2003 will no longer be allowed for use on Singapore’s roads after 30 June 2028. Motorcycles on the Classic, Vintage (Restricted) and Revised Vintage Vehicle Schemes are exempted due to their limited usage on the road. Motorcycles registered in Singapore before 1 July 2003 and which are at least 35 years old on or before 30 June 2028 are eligible for conversion to the Classic Vehicle Scheme if they meet the relevant requirements like those pertaining to vehicle inspection and motor insurance coverage, as specified by the Land Transport Authority (LTA).   "
subsidy for replacement of non-fire rated doors under optional improvement works scheme,"Mr Ong Teng Koon asked the Minister for National Development whether there is a subsidy for the replacement of non-fire rated doors under the Optional Improvement Works Scheme of the Home Improvement Programme and, if so, whether HDB will consider to provide the same quantum of subsidy for the replacement of a fire-rated door.","Mr Lawrence Wong:  Since 1996, the Fire Code requires the main doors of some HDB flats, e.g. those which face fire escape routes, to be fire-rated. All flats built by HDB since then have been provided with fire-rated main doors, where required. HDB also carried out a one-off door replacement exercise for flats built prior to 1996 which needed fire-rated main doors to comply with the Fire Code, at no cost to residents. As the units with fire-rated doors have already enjoyed a free replacement of doors by HDB, HDB will not provide any further subsidy for the replacement of their fire-rated doors."
proportion of jobseekers placed in jobs by workforce singapore and e21,"Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Manpower (a) in each of the last three years, what proportion of jobseekers are placed into jobs that are directly introduced by Workforce Singapore (WSG) and e2i; and (b) whether there are plans to improve the overall placement rates by WSG and e2i.","Mrs Josephine Teo: The proportion of jobseekers registered with WSG’s Careers Connect and NTUC’s e2i centres who are placed into jobs has improved over the last three years (see Table 1).WSG and NTUC’s e2i continually seek to improve the effectiveness of their services to jobseekers. In July 2017, WSG career centres were upgraded to Careers Connect with an expanded suite of customised career matching services. Jobseekers who require more in-depth support can undergo tailored career management and counselling programmes and receive dedicated one-to-one career coaching suited to their needs.WSG has also launched the MyCareersFuture portal to help jobseekers and employers perform smarter and faster job searches. It prioritises search results according to the relevance of a jobseeker’s skills and shows jobs that are supported by the Adapt & Grow programmes.In addition to career matching services, jobseekers can also tap on programmes such as the Professional Conversion Programmes (PCPs) and Career Support Programme (CSP) to help them overcome mismatches in skills and wage expectations."
resident employment rate for persons aged 25-64 with education qualifications below secondary school level,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the resident employment rate for those aged 25 to 64 with education qualifications below secondary school level; and (b) what are the initiatives to help those in this category who are currently unemployed to find a job.,"Mrs Josephine Teo: The employment rate for residents4 aged 25 to 64 with below secondary qualifications was 67% in 20175, higher than most OECD countries. Of the remaining 33% who were not in employment, 30%-points were outside the labour force (i.e. not looking for a job), mainly due to family responsibilities and health-related reasons, and the remaining were unemployed (i.e. looking for a job). In 2017, the annual average unemployment rate of 2.6% for residents with below secondary qualifications was lower than the overall resident annual average unemployment rate of 3.1%.There is a wide range of support under the Government’s Adapt and Grow initiative to assist unemployed jobseekers, including those with below secondary qualifications. (a) To address “missed matches”, Workforce Singapore’s (WSG) Careers Connect and NTUC’s Employment and Employability Institute (e2i) centres provide a suite of career matching services that caters to the different needs of each jobseeker.(b) To address mismatches in skills or expectations, there are programmes such as Place and Train and Career Trial to help jobseekers secure a job.Through the Adapt and Grow initiative, the Government placed about 2,500 jobseekers with below secondary qualifications into new jobs and careers in 2017."
students seeking assistance from career guidance offices in polytechnics and ites,Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Education (a) what is the number of students who have sought assistance from career guidance offices situated in all the polytechnics and ITEs in the last two years; (b) what is the percentage of these students out of the total student population within the same period; and (c) whether there has been an assessment or review of the effectiveness of the enhanced career guidance programmes in these institutions.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung:  All students at our polytechnics and ITE undergo forty to sixty hours of ECG curriculum, guided by their lecturers and ECG Counsellors. Students are also exposed to career options through learning journeys to companies, workshops with industry representatives and alumni, career fairs, and internships. In addition, all students have access to the MySkillsFuture portal, a key resource for education and industry information, with tools to support career development. In 2016, MOE set up ECG centres in every polytechnic and ITE college to serve as touchpoints for all students. All students are introduced to the ECG services and resources offered at these centres, which include ECG workshops and talks, and career and industry related materials and references. Students who require more targeted ECG support can approach their lecturers for advice, or the ECG Counsellors at the ECG centres for individual or group Counselling sessions. In the last two years, about 1 in 25 students have scheduled one-on-one or group guidance sessions with the ECG Counsellors.There is awareness of the usefulness of ECG, and the utilisation of the resources will increase with time."
breakdown of psle cohorts entering university from 75th to below 30th percentiles based on psle results,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Education in the past 10 years, how many students from each PSLE cohort successfully entered university, broken down according to their PSLE results that are (i) in the 60th to 75th percentile (ii) in the 50th to 60th percentile (iii) in the 30th to 50th percentile and (iv) below the 30th percentile.","Mr Ong Ye Kung:  Our education system provides students with multiple pathways and opportunities to pursue an education best suited to their needs, interests and strengths. Students may attend university and pursue an academic education, or develop skills and technical expertise through other pathways. PSLE results need not and should not be the only determinant of the future success of any pupil. Notwithstanding, the data requested by the member is as follows:•  The proportion of students who gained admission to local publicly-funded degree courses increased steadily from 23% for the 1997 PSLE cohort to 31% for the 2006 PSLE cohort, in tandem with expansion of university places.•  From 1997 to 2006, the proportion of PSLE cohort with results in the 51st to 75th percentile, and admitted to publicly-funded degree courses, increased from 24% to 38%.•  The corresponding figure for those whose PSLE results are in the bottom half increased from 4% to 10%."
plans to meet increased demand for primary school places in bukit batok smc,"Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Education in light of the recently completed and upcoming completion of BTO developments in and near Bukit Batok SMC, what is the expected increase in demand for primary school places in primary schools located within and near Bukit Batok SMC and what are the Ministry's plans to meet this increased demand.",Mr Ong Ye Kung:  MOE regularly reviews the demand and supply trends for school places at the national and regional levels. Our school planning takes into account the current and projected population and planned housing development programmes to ensure that there are sufficient school places to meet the needs of families with school-going children in each residential area.MOE is aware of the new housing developments that were recently completed in Bukit Batok and those that will be completing in the next few years. The demand from these new housing developments have been taken into account in the planning of school places.There are currently 9 primary schools within 2km of the new housing developments in Bukit Batok SMC. There is sufficient capacity in these schools to meet the projected demand from residents.MOE will continue to monitor the demand and supply situation of the primary schools in this area closely.
"proportion of fresh graduates of autonomous universities, private educational institutes offering degrees, polytechnics and ite hired by public service","Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Education (a) what proportion of fresh graduates of autonomous universities, private educational institutes offering degrees, polytechnics, and ITE are hired by the public service as their first job; and (b) how does this proportion compare to other developed countries such as the US, UK, Japan, Korea, Australia, Germany, France and Israel.","Mr Ong Ye Kung:  Based on the latest Graduate Employment Survey, 26% of employed Autonomous University respondents reported that they were working in the Government, statutory boards or organs of state six months after their final examinations. The proportions for Private Education Institution full-time degree, polytechnic and ITE respondents were 7%, 13% and 13% respectively.The Ministry of Education does not have comparable statistics from other developed countries."
promoting integration between students attending international and moe-run schools,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Education what is being done to promote integration between students attending international schools and students attending schools run by the Ministry.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung:  Our schools strive to develop cross-cultural competencies among students. Through Character and Citizenship Education lessons, and exchange programmes with international schools in Singapore and overseas, schools provide opportunities for students to value diversity and work with others of different cultures and nationalities. Further opportunities for deeper student interaction between the mainstream and international schools include sports competitions, Model United Nations conferences, debating championships and common interest youth groups.  Our schools will continue to actively create opportunities for students to interact across schools so as to develop the cultural literacy of our students and promote an inclusive society."
percentage of students promoted from normal technical to normal academic and express streams in past five years,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Education in each of the past five years for each cohort of students, what is the percentage of students who are promoted from (i) Normal Technical to Normal Academic and (ii) Normal Academic to Express respectively.","Mr Ong Ye Kung:  For students who have completed secondary school over the last five years:•  Close to 10% of the Normal (Technical) students transferred to the Normal (Academic) course; and•  About 5% of the Normal (Academic) students transferred to the Express course.Beyond lateral transfers to another course, many more students selectively offer specific subjects at a higher level, in line with their strengths. This is known as Subject-based Banding, which is part of our efforts to offer multiple pathways and opportunities to students to pursue an education best suited to their needs, interests and strengths."
estimated annual revenue from imposition of parking fees for teachers in schools,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Education what is the estimated annual revenue that will be derived from the imposition of parking fees for teachers in schools.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung:  The estimated revenue from car park charges collected by our 360 primary schools, secondary schools and junior colleges is estimated to be $8-10 million a year. The revenue will be retained by the schools."
custody of children in divorce cases,"Mr Seah Kian Peng asked the Minister for Social and Family Development in the last three years, what has been the number of divorce cases where custody of the children has been accorded to (i) mothers only (ii) fathers only and (iii) both parents respectively.",Mr Desmond Lee: The breakdown of custody orders for divorces from 2014 to 2016 is as follows:Table 1: Orders Made for Custody for Divorces Granted/ Registered in 2014-2016
workfare income supplement employee-recipients by age group,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Manpower for each year from 2015 to 2017 (a) what is the number of Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) employee-recipients based on the four age groups under WIS; (b) what is the total corresponding expenditure incurred in each year to disburse WIS to the employee group; and (c) what are the considerations taken into account in determining the WIS payout.,"Mrs Josephine Teo:  Table 1 shows the number of employees receiving Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) in each of the four WIS age groups, and the total amount of WIS allotted annually for work done in 2015 to 2017.Table 1: Number of employees receiving WIS and total amount of WIS allotted for work done in 2015 to 20176WIS is targeted at workers in the bottom 20% by income percentile, with graduated support provided to those up to the 30th income percentile. The amount of WIS an employee receives depends on his age and income. In general, older employees receive higher payouts than younger employees. The WIS scheme was introduced in 2007 and has consistently benefitted more than 20% of Singaporean employee workforce. The number of WIS recipients fluctuates each year and tends to decline in periods of rising incomes. Between 2015 and 2017, nominal wage at the 20th percentile of full-time employed citizens has grown by an average of 4.7% p.a. This explains the smaller number of WIS recipients in 2017 compared to 2015. Such changes in incomes are taken into account at every three-yearly review of WIS to ensure that more than 20% of Singaporean employees remain eligible for WIS. The results of the next review will be announced next year, for implementation in 2020."
counselling services for children or young persons involved in statutory rape and sexual misconduct cases carried out by persons known to victims,"Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) whether current services and programmes are sufficient to deal with cases of statutory rape and sexual misconduct involving children or young persons that are carried out by persons known to the victims; and (b) whether mandatory counselling services will be extended to families where children or young persons are victims of sexual misconduct involving family members, kin and persons known to the victims.","Mr Desmond Lee:  Keeping children safe from sexual abuse requires a whole-of-society effort. There are established inter-agency protocols, services, and programmes to support victims and their families, and to bring perpetrators to justice.When children experience or are suspected of having experienced sexual abuse, the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) and the Singapore Police Force (SPF) will step in. Children who are not safe at home may be placed temporarily with relatives, a foster family, or a children’s home. These children and their families are also supported with a range of community services, and may be referred to MSF psychologists to help them recover from the trauma of abuse. Each child is affected differently by the abuse, and the intervention will be tailored according to the different risks and needs of the child and the family. MSF is constantly looking at ways to improve the assessment and evidence-based intervention for our clients, in line with international practices.Concurrently, suspected perpetrators will be investigated by the SPF. The child plays an important role in the investigation. To reduce the trauma faced by child victims from having to travel to different locations and recounting the incident to different professionals, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and MSF will be piloting a one-stop, multi-disciplinary approach at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital.Perpetrators of child abuse may be charged under the Penal Code, or the Children and Young Persons Act. At the same time, their longer term rehabilitation is needed to prevent the abuse from recurring. The Court can order the perpetrator, who may be a parent or guardian, to undergo counselling, assessments, treatments, or other programmes.Upstream prevention of child abuse and self-protection is equally important. Children are taught about personal safety in schools. They are taught to recognise sexual abuse and harassment, acquire skills to protect themselves both in real life and online, and understand the laws that protect them in Singapore. They also learn to seek help from trusted adults, such as their parents, teachers and school counsellors when there is risk of their personal safety being compromised.Beyond the existing multi-agency network of help, members of the public can also play their part. Noticing child abuse and bringing it to attention is the first step that enables the range of support services to kick in. Anyone who is aware of a child being or at risk of being abused, can help by alerting a community-based Child Protection Specialist Centre, MSF’s Child Protective Service, the ComCare Hotline 1800- 222-0000 or their nearest Family Service Centre. Where a life is in danger, the public should immediately call the Police."
employers notifying mom of downward revision to salary terms for work permit holders,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Manpower in each of the past three years (a) how many employers have informed the Ministry in writing of modifications to the salary terms for a Work Permit holder to less favourable terms than declared and stated in their in-principle approval letter; (b) how many employers have been fined for not having done so; (c) how many notices of salary reduction have been issued to workers; and (d) on what grounds does the Ministry determine whether a salary reduction can be allowed.,"Mrs Josephine Teo:  When applying for Work Permits (WPs), employers are required to declare key salary terms, including the basic and fixed monthly salary, offered to prospective Work Permit Holders (WPHs). Since 2011, these terms have been reflected in the In-Principle Approval (IPA) letter, which is available in the WPHs’ native languages, and must be sent by the employer to the worker in his home country prior to the worker’s departure to Singapore. This ensures that the worker is fully aware and accepts the terms of conditions before leaving his home country.In some cases, employers may discover that the WPH’s performance falls below what is expected, and thus cannot justify paying the agreed salary. Instead of terminating the WPH’s contract, MOM allows employers to revise the salary downwards, provided they have obtained the worker’s written agreement and have notified MOM of the revision. In the past three years, MOM was notified of salary reductions affecting less than 2 percent of non-domestic WPHs per year.We have taken action against employers who reduced salaries without informing MOM or obtaining the WPH’s written consent. In the first half of 2018, a total of $105,000 in Administrative Financial Penalties were imposed on 17 errant employers.Notwithstanding these safeguards, we have been monitoring salary disputes involving IPA salary reduction. The proportion of WPH salary claims which involve IPA salary reductions was stable at about 7% over the last 3 years, but increased to about 11% in the second half of last year.Since February 2018, when mediating salary disputes, the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM) has insisted that employers provide documented evidence that the worker has consented to any salary reduction. TADM no longer allows for arguments from employers that the worker had provided tacit or verbal consent. In addition, MOM is considering the possibility of disallowing downward salary revisions altogether. While this will provide workers with more certainty of their wage for the entire duration of their stay in Singapore, it could also lead to possible early termination of employment even when the worker is willing to accept a lower wage. We will thus consult with relevant stakeholders to determine the best step forward."
self-harm cases involving children aged 14 and below,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) whether there has been an increase in the number of children aged 14 and below involved in self-harm cases; (b) how these cases came to be reported; and (c) what assistance was rendered to the children and their families.,"Mr Desmond Lee:  Self-harm typically occurs in private. The child’s injury may come to the attention of others when there are observable scars or medical attention is required.In school, students are taught healthy ways of coping with stress and personal difficulties, and are encouraged to seek help from trusted adults. They are also taught to look out for and support one another and to alert their teacher or school counsellor if their friends encounter difficulties. Students who self-harm would be referred to school counsellors for help. For complex cases, school counsellors would refer them for further assessment and intervention by medical doctors, clinical psychologists, or other relevant specialists. The number of students aged 14 and below who have been referred for school counselling over the past three years has been small with no significant increase.Self-harm cases may also present at hospitals for treatment of physical injuries. Over the past three years, the number of hospital admissions for self-inflicted injuries among children aged 14 years and below was 42 in 2015, 37 in 2016 and 30 in 2017. These children would be treated for their physical injuries and provided with counselling and psychological support to empower them with other forms of coping techniques.Mental well-being is important in enabling our children to manage stress well. As the causes of self-harm are often complex and multi-faceted, we take a holistic approach to support children with self-harming behaviour, as well as their families. Families and children with psycho-social issues are referred directly to professionals, or community touch points such as Family Service Centres (FSCs) so that they can receive appropriate help to deal with the issues and achieve greater resilience. MSF’s Social Service Offices help FSCs to coordinate with various government agencies to ensure appropriate support for clients and work through the potential stressors on the family."
reasons for rejection of non-domestic work permit applications,Mr Kok Heng Leun asked the Minister for Manpower over the last 12 months (a) what are the top five reasons for rejecting non-domestic work permit applications other than the reason of the employer not meeting the dependency ratio; and (b) what channels are open to the worker and employer to find out the reason for the rejection.,"Mrs Josephine Teo:  Applications for work permits are screened to minimise incidence where undesirable persons are inadvertently allowed to work in Singapore. Apart from this factor and the employer not meeting dependency ratio, the top reasons for rejecting non-domestic work permit applications were:(i) The employer or applicant had adverse record(s);(ii)      The employer did not have sufficient Man-Year Entitlement9;(iii) The employer did not have enough higher skilled work permit holders to hire new basic skilled workers10;(iv) The worker had exceeded the maximum employment period; or(v) The worker was not from an approved source country.Employers or their employment agents can view the rejection reasons for their work permit applications through MOM’s Work Permit Online (WPOL) service on the MOM website. Applicants can also check with their employment agents or prospective employers. Where there are security concerns, the reasons for rejection may not always be specified. Instead, the employer is advised to look for another candidate.  "
regulation of living conditions and protection of rights of foreign domestic workers after arrival and before employment,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether the Ministry regulates the living conditions and protection of rights of foreign domestic workers after they have arrived in Singapore and before employment; and (b) how regularly does the Ministry inspect the boarding houses and interview the workers.,"Mrs Josephine Teo:  Employment Agencies (EAs) that bring in Foreign Domestic Workers (FDWs) are required, under their licence, to upkeep and maintain the FDWs prior to their deployment to their employers’ households. This includes the provision of food, medical treatment and proper accommodation at the agencies’ cost.EAs have to comply with the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) and Housing & Development Board (HDB) occupancy load criteria. EAs must also ensure that the FDWs have privacy and hygienic living conditions. The places of accommodation used by EAs must be registered with MOM.MOM regularly inspects the places of accommodation and may interview the occupants as part of the process. Over 100 premises are inspected every year. The majority of the EAs have been found to be compliant. Violations were detected for 33 EAs out of 131 EAs whose premises were inspected in the past 12 months, but most were also relatively minor. These EAs are likely to receive a warning or composition fine, as well as demerit points. EAs with severe violations will be prosecuted and may be fined up to $5,000 and/or jailed up to 6 months. They may also have their licences revoked.  "
additional interest rates for low-income groups' cpf savings,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Manpower whether additional interest rates can be given to the low income groups' CPF savings that will support their retirement needs.,"Mrs Josephine Teo:  The CPF system has a progressive interest rate structure that provides a higher effective interest rate to CPF members with lower balances.Balances in the Ordinary Account earn 2.5% per annum, while those in the Special Account, Retirement Account, and Medisave Account earn 4% per annum. On top of this, an Extra Interest of 1% is paid on the first $60,000 of combined CPF balances. CPF members aged 55 and above also receive an Additional Extra Interest of 1% on the first $30,000 of their combined CPF balances. Therefore, CPF members with lower balances are earning a higher effective interest rate per annum on their CPF savings.The Government also provides CPF top-ups to help low-wage Singaporeans build up their retirement savings, via the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) Scheme. For example, eligible low-wage employees aged 45 to 54 receive up to $2,200 of WIS payouts a year, comprising of 60% in CPF top-ups and 40% in cash. Older workers receive even higher WIS payouts. In total, more than $650 million in WIS payouts were paid to over 400,000 low-wage workers in 2017, of which more than $400 million were credited into their CPF accounts."
update on appropriate adult scheme for young suspects below 16 years of age,Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether he can provide an update on the Appropriate Adult Scheme for young suspects below 16 years of age; (b) what is the current number of volunteers under the scheme; (c) whether the scheme is implemented at all police divisions; and (d) what is the number of times a volunteer has been called upon under this scheme since April 2017.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The Appropriate Adult Scheme for Young Suspects was launched in phases from April 2017. During the pilot phase, from April 2017 to April 2018, Appropriate Adults were activated to provide emotional support to young suspects investigated by the Police and Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) at Bedok Division, by the Police's Criminal Investigation Department, and by CNB's Investigation Division.Feedback from investigation officers and Appropriate Adults has been positive. Since April 2018, the scheme has been expanded to cover Police and CNB cases investigated at Clementi, Central, and Tanglin Divisions, as well as cases investigated by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau and Singapore Customs. With this expansion, the scheme is expected to support about half of all young suspects investigated by the Police and CNB. The full roll-out is expected to be completed in mid-2019. The Singapore Children's Society (SCS) manages the scheme, and is responsible for recruiting, training, and deploying Appropriate Adults. There are currently 408 Appropriate Adults, and they have been activated about 690 times since April 2017.Volunteers have to undergo a day-long training session by SCS. The training is supported by the Association of Criminal Lawyers of Singapore, the Law Society of Singapore, Attorney-General's Chambers, Singapore Police Force, Central Narcotics Bureau, Ministry of Social and Family Development, Ministry of Home Affairs, and the National Council of Social Service."
permits for public assemblies issued under public order act in 2017,"Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for Home Affairs with respect to the over 900 permits for public assemblies issued under the Public Order Act in 2017 (a) what proportion of permits related to events held at Speakers' Corner as opposed to events at other venues; (b) whether there have been any permits issued for outdoor assemblies at venues other than Speakers' Corner and, if so, what has been the nature of these assemblies; and (c) for the permits granted for events at Speakers' Corner, what are the reasons for requiring a permit for those events.","Mr K Shanmugam: Of the over 900 Police permits issued for public assemblies in 2017, only one was for a public assembly at Speakers' Corner.The rest were for public assemblies held elsewhere. 835 of them were outdoor events. These events were mostly religious celebrations, and constituency events organised by grassroots organisations. Under the Public Order Act, a Police permit is required for a public assembly if the purpose of the gathering is to:i) Demonstrate support for or opposition to the views or actions of any persons, group of persons or any government;ii) To publicise a cause or campaign; oriii) To mark or commemorate any event.As for Speakers' Corner, there were 40 public events held there in 2017. A Police permit is not required if the event meets the conditions set out in the Public Order (Unrestricted Area) Order 2016.The one event in 2017 at Speakers' Corner where a Police permit was granted was a public assembly to promote awareness on breastfeeding. The event involved the participation of foreigners, which is against one of the exemption conditions. The Police granted a permit after assessing the event in totality, including that it did not promote a cause that was political, controversial, or divisive in nature."
"legislation on statutory rape and sexual misconduct involving minors, children and young persons","Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Law (a) whether current legislation regarding statutory rape and sexual misconduct involving minors, children or young persons will be enhanced in light of the recent cases involving persons known to the victims; and (b) whether current legislation has sufficiently accounted for the increasing use of online platforms for the sexual grooming and engaging of unsuspecting victims.","Mr K Shanmugam: We have provisions in the Penal Code, Children and Young Persons Act, and Women's Charter that cover sexual offences against children and young people. For example, rape of a woman under 14 carries a mandatory minimum of eight years' imprisonment, and a maximum of 20 years. There is also mandatory caning of not less than 12 strokes.As part of the ongoing Penal Code Review, we are reviewing these laws and seeking to enhance protection for such vulnerable persons.To the Member's second question, sexual grooming of a minor under 16 is currently criminalised under section 376E of the Penal Code. This offence is also being reviewed, and we are also looking to enhance protection for minors against online communications of a sexual nature.The proposals from the Penal Code Review will be tabled for public consultation later this year. "
inmates who go through divorce proceedings during incarceration or after release,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Home Affairs for each of the past three years (a) how many inmates go through divorce proceedings while in the Drug Rehabilitation Centres, or while undergoing incarceration under the Long-Term Imprisonment 1 and Long-Term Imprisonment 2 regimes respectively; (b) how many go through divorce proceedings within two years of release respectively; and (c) what is the recidivism rate of inmates who have undergone divorce during incarceration and following release respectively.","Mr K Shanmugam: The Singapore Prison Service (SPS) does not maintain records of inmates undergoing divorce proceedings, nor after they are released.Regardless of marital status, inmates undergo programmes based on their risk of re-offending and their needs. These include family programmes to address transitional issues for inmates and their families, and to equip them with knowledge and skills that will help strengthen their relationships with each other. More than 4,000 inmates benefitted from family programmes in 2017. SPS aims to work with community partners to extend family programmes to more inmates."
statistics and profiles of private-hire drivers,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Minister for Transport (a) how many private-hire drivers are there as at 31 March 2018; (b) what is the gender/race/age profile of these drivers; (c) what is the number of full-time private-hire drivers; and (d) what is the number of drivers who are doing it on an ad-hoc basis.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: As of 31 March 2018, there are approximately 54,000 private hire car (PHC) drivers. More than 90% of them are male. About 70% of the drivers are Chinese, 17% are Malays, 8% are Indians and 5% are Others. About half the drivers are between 20 and 39 years old; 40% between 40 and 59 years old; and the rest between 60 and 74 years old. We do not have the breakdown between drivers who drive full-time, and those who drive on an ad-hoc basis. "
number of subsidised and non-subsidised rental flats in singapore,"Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the current number of subsidised and non-subsidised rental flats in Singapore; (b) what is the distribution in terms of one-room, two-room, three-room and four-room and above flats; (c) how many Singaporeans are currently living in subsidised rental flats; and (d) what is the gender/race/age profile of those living in subsidised rental flats.","Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB currently manages about 60,600 subsidised rental flats under three schemes:a) The Public Rental Scheme, for Singapore Citizen (SC) households who have no other housing options or family support;b) Interim Rental Housing, for SC families who are in financial hardship and require urgent temporary accommodation; andc) The Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme (PPHS), mainly for first-timer families who are awaiting the completion of their new flats. HDB does not rent out non-subsidised flats. The distribution of subsidised rental flats by flat type is in Table 1, and the details requested about the households living in these flats are in Tables 2 to 4."
breakdown of persons employed in accounts and bookkeeping,"Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Minister for Manpower for each year from 2012 to 2017, how many persons have been employed in the respective occupations of (i) accounting associate professional (ii) bookkeeper (iii) ledger and accounts clerk (iv) audit clerk (v) payroll/wages clerk (vi) billing clerk (vii) procurement/purchasing clerk and (viii) other accounting clerks.","Mrs Josephine Teo: The table below shows the number of residents who have been employed as (i) Accounting Associate Professionals and (ii) Accounting and Bookkeeping Clerks, which comprise the following occupations:a)  Bookkeeper;b)  Ledger and accounts clerk;c) Audit clerk;d) Payroll/wages clerk;e) Billing clerk;f)  Procurement/purchasing clerk; andg) Other accounting clerks A further breakdown by these occupations is not available, as we have not captured a sufficient number of observations in our sample to enable us to provide a meaningful estimate of their employment size. "
adequacy of current sex education curriculum to equip students with knowledge to protect themselves against predatory sexual behaviours,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Education (a) whether the current sex education curriculum adequately equips students with the knowledge to protect themselves against predatory sexual behaviours; (b) whether there are plans to engage and involve parents to introduce appropriate sex education content at home; (c) what is the number of cases involving statutory rape and predatory sexual behaviours that have been reported through schools over the last five years; (d) whether teachers are adequately trained to identify students who are victims of such sexual misconduct; and (e) how are such reported cases being dealt with.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: We have a carefully planned curriculum, starting from lower primary and to upper secondary, to impart to our students the awareness and skills to protect themselves from sexual exploitation and abuse. For example, in lower primary, students are taught how to differentiate between a good and bad touch; in upper primary, they learn things like how to protect themselves from sexual advances, setting clear physical boundaries in a relationship, and the double-edged nature of the Internet. In secondary school, they learn more about the usefulness and dangers of cyberspace, dealing with relationships, and differentiating between healthy relationship and sexual grooming, etc. All these aim towards inculcating in our students a strong sense of the right to be treated with respect, to protect themselves, to not feel guilty or shame if they are victims, and seek help and counsel. Parents too play a key role in their children's sexuality education. The schools support parents with information on what their children are learning about sexuality and also offer parenting advice on how to initiate discussions on sexuality issues at home. We encourage parents to be open in discussing their beliefs and values, and being available to guide their children on sexuality matters.We understand the member is concerned about this issue and wishes to know the number of cases of sexual offences every year. Our numbers are low by international standards. We monitor the numbers but have not been releasing them. Instead, we are raising awareness through education, counsel and advice in schools and within families. Our teachers are trained to look out for signs of distress in students and refer them to the school counsellors or other professional support when necessary. Suspected cases of statutory rape and predatory sexual behaviours involving a parent, carer or other household member are reported to the Ministry of Social and Family Development's Child Protection Service. When cases involve non-household members, parents will be advised to report to the police. If parents refuse to do so, the schools will make the report. However, it is sometimes difficult for schools to track such cases as parents may not keep the schools informed, and the outcomes of the police investigation may not be made known to schools. "
"review of economic restructuring strategies to deal with rapid change in technology, deglobalisation and protectionism","Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether there is a need to review our economic restructuring strategies in view of the rapid change in technology, increased risk of deglobalisation and protectionism so as to continue strengthening our competitiveness.","Mr Chan Chun Sing: The Committee on the Future Economy (CFE) had identified the key global and structural shifts, as well as rapid technological changes and growing sentiments against globalisation that would impact us, in developing a comprehensive set of recommendations to guide our economic strategy for the next five to 10 years. Given this, our key economic restructuring efforts will be centred on strengthening enterprise capabilities, building strong digital capabilities, deepening the skills of Singaporeans, and continuing to work together with other economies to stay open and connected, build stronger links, and collaborate closely to boost growth and competitiveness. One of the recommendations of the CFE was the development of Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs), which are industry-specific roadmaps that organise our economic restructuring efforts. The ITMs were developed through an integrated and coordinated tripartite approach, that brought together key stakeholders. We have since launched ITMs for each of the 23 ITM sectors, which together cover 80 percent of the Singapore economy. Each ITM is tailored to the opportunities, needs, and challenges of specific sectors. Some sectors, such as those in the Manufacturing and Modern Services clusters will focus on growth and strengthening their competitive edge, while other sectors such as those in the Lifestyle and Built Environment clusters will be transforming for higher productivity and better jobs. There will be bright spots within every sector The ITMs are dynamic plans that will be updated to respond to changes in the economic environment. We will continue to monitor the progress of our ITMs, refining strategies where necessary to ensure they stay relevant as new trends emerge. Ultimately, the success of our economic restructuring efforts depends on the collective efforts of all stakeholders. Besides the Government, which will serve as an enabler to support this transformation, our trade association and chambers (TACs) and unions also have a key role to galvanise firms of every size, and mobilise workers in every sector, to be part of this transformation journey. Our companies need to reconsider the way they operate and compete, and how they partner one another to sustain competitiveness and create good jobs."
impact of us tariffs on singapore economy,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) whether the tariffs imposed by the US on solar panels, washing machines, steel and aluminium have any impact on the Singapore economy; (b) what is the estimated impact on businesses; and (c) how will it affect our economic strategy.","Mr Chan Chun Sing: The US announced a series of safeguard measures in the form of tariffs on solar panels and washing machines under Section 201 of the 1974 Trade Act in January 2018, as well as steel and aluminium under Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act in March 2018.In 2017, Singapore's domestic exports to the US was S$228.9 million for solar cells and modules, and S$36,000 for washing machines. Domestic exports to the US totalled S$4.6 million for steel, and S$7.1 million for aluminium. In aggregate, these exports made up 1.4% of Singapore’s total domestic exports to the US, and a smaller 0.09% of Singapore’s total domestic exports to the world.The US tariffs have the effect of making the prices of these products more expensive to US importers, which may reduce their demand for overseas products. Given the modest share that the products affected by the US tariffs have as a percentage of Singapore's total domestic exports, the direct negative impact of the US tariffs on the Singapore economy is limited.Nonetheless, we are closely monitoring developments on these safeguard measures, which do impact some companies in Singapore. Singapore has registered our concerns with the relevant US departments and consulted with the US on possible exemption from the safeguard measures.As a small and open economy, having free and connected markets is critical for Singapore. It is important that Singapore and like-minded partners uphold the rules-based multilateral trading system, and ensure that such safeguard measures do not become entrenched and turn into barriers to trade. Even as Singapore continues to build stronger links and collaborate closely with our trading partners to boost growth and create jobs, we will continue to safeguard our trade interests and resist protectionist practices which could disrupt the flow of global commerce. "
number of companies applying for workpro grants,"Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how many companies have applied for WorkPro since its introduction in 2013; (b) whether there has been an increase in the number of applications after the introduction of the enhanced scheme in 2016; and (c) whether there are any reviews of the age management practices, redesigned work places and processes and/or flexible work arrangements implemented by the companies after the disbursement of the grant.","Mrs Josephine Teo: Under WorkPro, companies can receive funding support to (i) implement age management practices through the Age Management Grant (AMG); (ii) redesign workplaces and processes to create easier, safer and smarter jobs for older workers through the Job Redesign Grant (JRG); and (iii) introduce and sustain use of flexible work arrangements (FWAs) through the Work-Life Grant (WLG). From 2013 to 2017, over 3,400 companies employing about 368,000 workers have benefited from WorkPro grants. We have continuously enhanced the WorkPro scheme. In 2016, we raised the maximum grant for the JRG from $150,000 to $300,000 per company to further facilitate job redesign efforts. To encourage more capability development projects to incorporate the requirements of older workers, JRG can be applied as a rider on top of other Government grants. Since the enhancement, and with additional effort to promote the scheme, the number of companies that benefitted from the JRG has increased from about 30 a year to about 440 a year.WorkPro funding is only disbursed when we are satisfied that the company has achieved the corresponding grant deliverables and is able to demonstrate the impact to their employees. Companies claiming for the AMG and JRG are required to submit evaluations of how projects undertaken have created a positive impact on their older employees. Similarly, under the WLG, companies claiming the Developmental Grant (DG) are required to submit evaluation reports on their FWA pilot projects, in addition to formalising these FWAs in the companies' HR policy to be offered to all other employees. The FWA Incentive (FI) is disbursed to companies after their employees have regularly used FWAs."
health effects from exposure to phthalates and plasticizers linked to hormone disruption and reproductive harm,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the Ministry monitors health effects from exposure to phthalates and plasticizers that are linked to hormone disruption and reproductive harm, particularly in male infants; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider putting in place regulations for consumer goods that contain harmful plasticizers.","Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang: Phthalates are common substances added to plastics to improve their flexibility and durability. MOH does not routinely monitor the health effects from exposure to phthalate among male infants, but we monitor global data and studies on the impact of exposure to phthalates on an ongoing basis. The findings of some studies have suggested that there is some potential for harm in humans, particularly when ingested, although the evidence is not conclusive. Nevertheless, Singapore has established regulations, based on international standards, to reduce exposure to phthalates as a precautionary measure.Enterprise Singapore regulates the use of phthalates in general consumer goods under the Consumer Protection (Consumer Goods Safety Requirements) Regulations (CGSR). The Regulations are aligned with applicable international, regional or national safety standards, and Enterprise Singapore monitors compliance through post-market surveillance. Additional regulatory requirements are imposed for toys and childcare articles in particular, including that on allowable concentrations of specified phthalates. The Health Sciences Authority administers the Health Products (Cosmetic Products – ASEAN Cosmetic Directive) Regulations and bans the use of plasticizers that are harmful to consumers in cosmetic products. The Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore administers the Food Regulations to ensure the safety of plastic food packaging, including plastic milk bottles. Through routine surveillance, any food with phthalate amounts above allowable limits would not be allowed for sale."
government entities knowingly investing in corporations in businesses harmful to health or environment,"Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for Finance whether the Government has set any restrictions on Government entities knowingly investing in corporations whose main business activity is harmful to health or the environment, such as those in the tobacco products industry.","Mr Heng Swee Keat: Government entities (ie, Ministries and Statutory Boards) set up or own companies to achieve specific public policy purpose. Examples include Public Hospitals which provide healthcare services and the Employment and Employability Institute which supports the training and placement of workers and job seekers. Such corporate entities will not engage in activities that are harmful to health or the environment.  Government's investments are done mainly through GIC and Temasek. As has been explained previously, GIC and Temasek operate on a commercial basis in order to maximise long-term risk-adjusted returns. Their individual investment decisions are independent of the Government. While the Government does not prescribe how GIC and Temasek invest, both emphasise sustainability in their investment activities. Both recognise that good sustainability practices are good for business and can have a positive impact on long-term returns. Conversely, companies with poor sustainability practices carry business and reputational risks."
"statistics on children and youth under 21 in children's homes, shelters and welfare homes","Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry asked the Minister for Social and Family Development what is the current number of children and youth under 21 who are currently residing within various children's homes, shelters and other welfare homes and whether this number has increased or decreased over the years.","Mr Desmond Lee: As of 31 December 2017, there were about 700 children and youth residing in Homes licensed under the Children and Young Persons Act (CYP Homes). This number has decreased over the years, because we are transforming the out-of-home care sector so that more children are placed in foster care rather than homes and institutions.In contrast to the licensed CYP Homes, shelters and welfare homes serve different target groups. Shelters are intended for adults who have exhausted all other means of accommodation or those who face family violence, while welfare homes are intended for destitute persons who are unable to work, have no financial means and do not have accommodation and family support."
smoking and alcohol consumption by spectators and players in the vicinity of sports stadiums,"Assoc Prof Randolph Tan asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) how often does smoking and consumption of alcohol by spectators and players occur in the vicinity of sports stadiums in the aftermath of sports matches, including on the running tracks; and (b) whether there has been feedback from other stadium users about the impact that the gathering such groups of drinkers on running tracks has on other sporting activities.","Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: Smoking is prohibited at all sporting facilities. This is in line with the Smoking (Prohibition in Certain Places) Act administered by the National Environment Agency, where smoking is prohibited in stadiums, swimming pools, indoor sports arenas, gymnasiums, fitness centres, etc.The consumption of alcohol at sporting facilities is generally disallowed. However, alcohol can be sold to spectators and consumed at certain events, subject to the approval of venue operators and licensing authorities.To date, Sport Singapore has received few complaints related to smoking and alcohol consumption within and in the vicinity of sporting facilities."
removal of gantry barriers in ura and hdb carparks with implementation of parking.sg,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for National Development (a) with the implementation of parking.sg, whether there are plans to remove the gantry barriers in all URA and HDB carparks; (b) what is the feedback on the app's accuracy of parking lot availability; and (c) what plans does the Ministry have to improve the app.","Mr Lawrence Wong: The Parking app has been implemented for all coupon-based car parks, for cars on 1 October 2017, and all other vehicle types on 20 December 2017. Since its launch, more than 2 million parking sessions have been logged by about 250,000 vehicles.The Parking.sg app serves to complement the existing Electronic Parking System (EPS), rather than to replace it. The app offers greater convenience to motorists parking in areas where EPS is not feasible due to site constraints, for example, kerbside parking lots by URA and HDB.We will continue to enhance the Parking.sg app for better user experience and improve its accessibility. Some of the enhancements that have already been incorporated include the addition of parking history, and the notification feature that alerts the user before the parking session expires.The Parking.sg app currently shows the motorist where the nearest car parks are located, but does not display the availability of the parking lots. This is because the lots may be occupied by some motorists using coupons, which we are unable to ascertain today. However, we are continuing to encourage more motorists to switch from coupons to the Parking.sg app, and as more do so over time, it will possible to incorporate this feature into future enhancements of the app."
complaints received by traffic police about noisy speeding vehicles at yishun avenue 1 at night,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) in 2016-17, how many complaints have the Traffic Police received about noisy speeding vehicles at Yishun Avenue 1 particularly at night; (b) what enforcement action has been taken; and (c) whether speed cameras can be installed to check on the speedsters.","Mr K Shanmugam: In 2016 and 2017, Traffic Police (TP) received a total of 11 complaints concerning speeding along Yishun Avenue 1.TP conducts regular patrols on our roads and mounts targeted enforcement operations at areas that are prone to accidents and speeding. For instance, TP had installed a speed camera along Yishun Avenue 1 in 2016, to deal with speeding in the area.TP will continue to monitor the situation, and further step up enforcement efforts as necessary."
use of senior citizens' card at signalised pedestrian crossings using green man plus scheme,"Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Transport (a) in the past three years, what is the average number of seniors who tap their senior citizen's card at signalised pedestrian crossings in using the Green Man Plus scheme; and (b) what are the plans to raise awareness of this scheme to get more elderly to tap their card.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The average monthly number of Green Man Plus activations by seniors has increased from 53,200 in 2015 to 69,600 in 2017.The Land Transport Authority (LTA) will continue to promote the scheme through exhibitions and public events. LTA will also work with grassroots leaders to reach out to seniors in their constituencies to increase awareness of the scheme."
direct bus service to connect boon lay place to jurong west,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Minister for Transport whether LTA will be able to roll out a bus service to directly connect Boon Lay Place to the Jurong West part of Boon Lay constituency as efforts to secure private transport companies to run a service have not been successful.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Currently, commuters can travel between Boon Lay Place and Jurong West via a direct public bus service (ie Service 99) or within one bus transfer. Given that there are existing bus services which serve these commuters, there are no plans to roll out new services to provide additional direct connections there."
hiring of workers above re-employment age of 67 in ministries and statutory boards,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Prime Minister (a) what is the Public Service Division's position on the hiring of workers above the re-employment age of 67 years across Ministries and statutory boards; and (b) whether Ministries and statutory boards are free to hire or extend employment beyond 67 years of age.,"Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): Public agencies can hire or re-employ officers who are above 67 years old as long as their services are needed. As at 31 December 2017, there are about 1,400 public officers who are aged 67 and above."
public transport mode share for bukit panjang town,Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for Transport what is the latest figure for the public transport mode share for Bukit Panjang Town and what is the figure before the opening of Downtown Line 2.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Based on the Household Interview Travel Surveys in 2012/2013 and 2016/2017, the peak period public transport mode share for Bukit Panjang increased from 56% to 58% after Downtown Line 2 opened in December 2015."
singapore's gini co-efficient after government taxes and transfers vis-à-vis other major developed economies in last five years,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Finance how Singapore's Gini co-efficient after Government taxes and transfers in each of the last five years compares to the Gini co-efficient after taxes and transfers for other major developed economies such as Japan, South Korea, the USA, the UK, France, Germany, Canada, Sweden, Norway and Denmark.","Mr Heng Swee Keat: There are different methodologies used internationally for calculating the Gini coefficient. Singapore’s Gini coefficient is typically reported based on household income from work per household member. The calculation by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is based on the Square Root Scale4.If we apply the OECD method to ourselves, then based on data from the latest available year, the Gini coefficients for Singapore and some major economies are shown in Chart 1.Before taxes and transfers, Singapore’s Gini coefficient is low compared with many major developed economies.After taxes and transfers, several countries have a lower Gini coefficient compared to Singapore. This is because they typically impose higher overall taxes on the working population and in particular on the middle-income, in order to finance large social transfers. In contrast, Singapore’s approach is to keep our tax burden low, and provide targeted support for the lower-income.In addition, these calculations do not reflect the full range of Government policy interventions that are unique to the Singapore context. For example, many Singaporeans enjoy significant subsidies for the purchase of HDB flats, which have helped them own homes in a high-quality living environment.Chart 1 International comparison of Gini coefficients based on the square root scale (latest available year)5"
adoption of snapsafe app by companies for reporting of workplace safety issues,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Manpower (a) to date, how many companies have adopted the SnapSAFE app for reporting of workplace safety issues; (b) how many complaints have been filed through the app in 2015, 2016, 2017 respectively; (c) what is the breakdown of valid and invalid reports; (d) how many companies have been reported; (e) how many employers have been disciplined for unsafe work practices in 2015, 2016 and 2017 respectively; and (f) what actions have been taken against them.","Mr Lim Swee Say: The number of reports received via the Snap@MOM app, number of valid reports, and number of companies issued with enforcement actions between 2015 and 2017 is shown below: -All valid reports have resulted in warnings or enforcement actions. The enforcement actions included Notices of Non-compliance, composition fines and/or Stop Work Orders.The Snap@MOM app was enhanced and replaced by the SnapSAFE app on 1 December 2017. It has a new internal corporate reporting function for in-house reporting of WSH lapses, near-misses or accidents to facilitate company ownership on WSH. As it is in its initial months of launch, we are currently reaching out to more companies to adopt this as an internal WSH reporting tool."
babies seeking paediatric care at kk women's and children's hospital from 6pm to 6am in past five years,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Health (a) how many babies sought paediatric care at KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH) from 6pm to 6am in the past five years; (b) what is the average waiting time during these hours; and (c) whether the Government will build more 24-hour outpatient paediatric clinics to take the load off KKH.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: In 2016 and 20171, 14,500 and 12,900 babies (those aged below one-year-old), respectively, sought paediatric care at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH) Children’s Emergency (CE) from 6 pm to 6 am. The median waiting time was 20 minutes and 27 minutes respectively. Patients assessed to be urgent cases by KKH’s CE triage will be attended to immediately.Less urgent cases (or P32 cases) made up about one in three of these attendances. KKH has assessed that many of these less urgent cases can be adequately managed by primary care doctors. Hence, KKH is developing a community partnership network with primary care doctors3 to provide care to non-emergency cases. MOH is also studying the possibility of piloting extended-hours paediatric urgent care clinics in regions with many young families. These would be operated by primary care doctors, to handle non-emergency cases.Besides KKH’s CE, babies requiring emergency paediatric care can also seek treatment at the National University Hospital’s (NUH) CE."
data of plastic bags used in singapore in past three years,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) for each year in the past three years, what is the number of plastic bags used in Singapore; and (b) if such data is not available, whether the Ministry intends to collect such data so as to measure the effectiveness of the current retailer schemes.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The National Environment Agency (NEA) currently does not monitor the number of plastic bags used in Singapore. Based on NEA’s waste characterisation study, it is estimated that plastic bags constitute a fifth of the plastic waste disposed of by weight. This trend has remained fairly constant, with the weight of the plastic waste disposed of in 2015, 2016 and 2017 estimated to be 766,800, 762,700 and 763,400 tonnes respectively.Under the mandatory reporting framework for packaging waste, which will be implemented by 2021, businesses will be required to report the type and amount of packaging they put on the market and their packaging waste reduction plans. The number of single-use plastic bags used may be included under the framework. NEA will start industry consultations on the framework this year.We will also continue to support initiatives by the private sector and non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and step up engagement with stakeholders to reduce the excessive use of plastic bags. For example, NEA will work with retailers to explore initiatives such as training cashiers to ask customers at payment counters if plastic bags are needed, and putting up visual cues in stores to serve as reminders."
fishing vessels caught trespassing waters of pulau tekong in last five years,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is the number of fishing vessels caught trespassing the waters of Pulau Tekong over the last five years; (b) what measures are in place to prevent such trespassing and whether they are sufficient; and (c) how are trespassers being dealt with.,"Mr K Shanmugam: From 2013 to 2017, the Police Coast Guard (PCG) detected an average of 34 vessels each year making illegal or unauthorised entry into the waters off Pulau Tekong for fishing activities.Parts of the waters around Pulau Tekong are designated as Working Areas by the Maritime & Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) due to reclamation work. Unauthorised entry into Working Areas is an offence under the MPA Act. The punishment is a fine of up to $5,000, and in the case of a continuing offence, a further fine of up to $500 for every day which the offence continues.Some of the vessels detected included cases of unlawful entry into Singapore by foreigners. These persons were arrested under the Immigration Act. The punishment is imprisonment of up to six months, and a minimum of three stokes of the cane, or a fine of up to $6,000 in lieu of caning.PCG has installed land- and sea-based barriers to protect our maritime borders and coastline. At Pulau Tekong, PCG has deployed floating sea barriers to prevent vessels from entering the designated Working Area and approaching the shoreline. PCG also deploys sensors such as radars and cameras to monitor our waters. This is complemented by regular PCG patrols to detect and interdict intrusions and illegal activities."
public transport mode share for bukit panjang town,Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for Transport what is the latest figure for the public transport mode share for Bukit Panjang Town and what is the figure before the opening of Downtown Line 2.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Based on the Household Interview Travel Surveys in 2012/2013 and 2016/2017, the peak period public transport mode share for Bukit Panjang increased from 56% to 58% after Downtown Line 2 opened in December 2015."
singapore's gini co-efficient after government taxes and transfers vis-à-vis other major developed economies in last five years,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Finance how Singapore's Gini co-efficient after Government taxes and transfers in each of the last five years compares to the Gini co-efficient after taxes and transfers for other major developed economies such as Japan, South Korea, the USA, the UK, France, Germany, Canada, Sweden, Norway and Denmark.","Mr Heng Swee Keat: There are different methodologies used internationally for calculating the Gini coefficient. Singapore’s Gini coefficient is typically reported based on household income from work per household member. The calculation by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is based on the Square Root Scale4.If we apply the OECD method to ourselves, then based on data from the latest available year, the Gini coefficients for Singapore and some major economies are shown in Chart 1.Before taxes and transfers, Singapore’s Gini coefficient is low compared with many major developed economies.After taxes and transfers, several countries have a lower Gini coefficient compared to Singapore. This is because they typically impose higher overall taxes on the working population and in particular on the middle-income, in order to finance large social transfers. In contrast, Singapore’s approach is to keep our tax burden low, and provide targeted support for the lower-income.In addition, these calculations do not reflect the full range of Government policy interventions that are unique to the Singapore context. For example, many Singaporeans enjoy significant subsidies for the purchase of HDB flats, which have helped them own homes in a high-quality living environment.Chart 1 International comparison of Gini coefficients based on the square root scale (latest available year)5"
adoption of snapsafe app by companies for reporting of workplace safety issues,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Manpower (a) to date, how many companies have adopted the SnapSAFE app for reporting of workplace safety issues; (b) how many complaints have been filed through the app in 2015, 2016, 2017 respectively; (c) what is the breakdown of valid and invalid reports; (d) how many companies have been reported; (e) how many employers have been disciplined for unsafe work practices in 2015, 2016 and 2017 respectively; and (f) what actions have been taken against them.","Mr Lim Swee Say: The number of reports received via the Snap@MOM app, number of valid reports, and number of companies issued with enforcement actions between 2015 and 2017 is shown below: -All valid reports have resulted in warnings or enforcement actions. The enforcement actions included Notices of Non-compliance, composition fines and/or Stop Work Orders.The Snap@MOM app was enhanced and replaced by the SnapSAFE app on 1 December 2017. It has a new internal corporate reporting function for in-house reporting of WSH lapses, near-misses or accidents to facilitate company ownership on WSH. As it is in its initial months of launch, we are currently reaching out to more companies to adopt this as an internal WSH reporting tool."
babies seeking paediatric care at kk women's and children's hospital from 6pm to 6am in past five years,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Health (a) how many babies sought paediatric care at KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH) from 6pm to 6am in the past five years; (b) what is the average waiting time during these hours; and (c) whether the Government will build more 24-hour outpatient paediatric clinics to take the load off KKH.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: In 2016 and 20171, 14,500 and 12,900 babies (those aged below one-year-old), respectively, sought paediatric care at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH) Children’s Emergency (CE) from 6 pm to 6 am. The median waiting time was 20 minutes and 27 minutes respectively. Patients assessed to be urgent cases by KKH’s CE triage will be attended to immediately.Less urgent cases (or P32 cases) made up about one in three of these attendances. KKH has assessed that many of these less urgent cases can be adequately managed by primary care doctors. Hence, KKH is developing a community partnership network with primary care doctors3 to provide care to non-emergency cases. MOH is also studying the possibility of piloting extended-hours paediatric urgent care clinics in regions with many young families. These would be operated by primary care doctors, to handle non-emergency cases.Besides KKH’s CE, babies requiring emergency paediatric care can also seek treatment at the National University Hospital’s (NUH) CE."
data of plastic bags used in singapore in past three years,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) for each year in the past three years, what is the number of plastic bags used in Singapore; and (b) if such data is not available, whether the Ministry intends to collect such data so as to measure the effectiveness of the current retailer schemes.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The National Environment Agency (NEA) currently does not monitor the number of plastic bags used in Singapore. Based on NEA’s waste characterisation study, it is estimated that plastic bags constitute a fifth of the plastic waste disposed of by weight. This trend has remained fairly constant, with the weight of the plastic waste disposed of in 2015, 2016 and 2017 estimated to be 766,800, 762,700 and 763,400 tonnes respectively.Under the mandatory reporting framework for packaging waste, which will be implemented by 2021, businesses will be required to report the type and amount of packaging they put on the market and their packaging waste reduction plans.

"students taking up higher chinese, higher malay and higher tamil in past 10 years","Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Education (Schools) (a) how many students have taken Higher Chinese, Higher Malay and Higher Tamil over the past 10 years; and (b) what reasons can be discerned that explain the trend.","Mr Ng Chee Meng: At the O-level, the proportion of Chinese Language students offering Higher Chinese has increased by about 4% over the past decade, to 30% last year. The proportion for Higher Tamil has increased over the same period from 19% to 30%. For Higher Malay, the proportion has hovered at around 11%.At PSLE, the proportion of students offering Higher Chinese and Higher Tamil has held steady at about 27% and 21% respectively. The proportion of students offering Higher Malay has reduced by about 4% over the past decade, to about 5% in 2017.MOE has reviewed the criteria to offer Higher Mother Tongue at O level in 2004, broadening access to beyond the top 10% of the cohort. Schools also have the discretion to allow any student to take up the subject if he or she demonstrates the passion and competency in Mother Tongue Language. This has led to the general increase in the proportion of students offering Higher Mother Tongue.However, there are also concerns from schools and parents on whether students can cope with too many subjects. MOE is working with schools to support students with the ability and interest in their Mother Tongues to continue to pursue it to as high a level as they can."
utilisation of respite care services and median and range of fees charged,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what is the median and range of respite care fees; (b) what is the utilisation of current respite care services; and (c) whether the capacity of respite care services is sufficient for our projected five years' demand.,"Mr Desmond Lee: Respite care services are currently provided by seven Adult Disability Homes and three Children Disability Homes. These services are offered to families of Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) who, for various reasons, may need short-term assistance in providing care for their loved ones.In the fourth quarter of 2017, the median daily respite care service fee was $74.40. Respite care fees range up to $107, but 62% (23 families) paid less than $10 per day after Government subsidies. Another 14% (5 needy families) had their fees waived by the Voluntary Welfare Organisations.The capacity for respite care has been assessed to be sufficient to meet the projected demand over the next five years. As at December 2017, 80 respite care service spaces were available across the 10 homes, and the average utilisation rate was less than 10% in the fourth quarter of 2017."
supply and demand for parenthood provisional housing scheme flats,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the current number of Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme (PPHS) flats; (b) what is the number of households currently enrolled in the scheme; and (c) whether the reduction in monthly rental in 2017 for PPHS flats has resulted in higher demand for such flats.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Currently, there are about 800 flats under the Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme (PPHS), of which about 650 are taken up.Since the rent reduction in March 2017, the average number of applications for and take-up of PPHS flats has increased by about 100% and 30% respectively."
revision of means test for legal aid,"Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for Law whether the means test for legal aid can be further revised to allow more Singaporeans to qualify for legal aid as the legal issues they face, such as matrimonial disputes and family-related legal issues, can severely compromise their personal financial ability to engage legal assistance on a commercial basis.","Mr K Shanmugam: The Ministry of Law regularly reviews the means test for civil legal aid, to ensure that legal aid remains accessible to lower income Singaporeans and PRs who cannot afford their own lawyers.Legal aid is unlike other forms of government social assistance, which benefits the individual seeking help, as legal aid often means the state helping one party in a legal case against another Singaporean. We must therefore ensure that our system is rigorous in only assisting those who wish to pursue meritorious cases but cannot afford to do so.For matrimonial disputes, the following provisions are in place to assist applicants first, where the spouses are estranged, LAB excludes the income of the applicant’s spouse when assessing the applicant’s means. Second, in a divorce case, the matrimonial property would not be included in the means assessment.Moreover, for family proceedings involving children or protection order applications between spouses or ex-spouses, the Director of Legal Aid can give an extra deduction for the disposable capital component of the means test. This ensures that the most vulnerable persons in family-related disputes are eligible for legal aid."
opening of new primary and secondary schools in punggol central and punggol way,Ms Sun Xueling asked the Minister for Education (Schools) in which year will the new primary school along Punggol Central (near Sumang LRT Station) and the new secondary school at the junction of Punggol Central and Punggol Way start taking in open enrolments of students and in which year will the schools start operations.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: There are currently 9 primary schools and 3 secondary schools in Punggol. MOE has plans to build 3 new schools – a primary and a secondary school at Punggol Central, and a primary school at Northshore Link, to meet the needs of residents from new housing developments in Punggol. Construction of the schools is expected to start soon, and we will provide more details on when the schools will open in due course."
average cost of constructing a signalised pedestrian crossing,Ms Sun Xueling asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the average cost of constructing a signalised pedestrian crossing; and (b) what is the assessment criteria for constructing a pedestrian crossing.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The average cost of constructing a signalised pedestrian crossing is about $250,000.When assessing the need for a pedestrian crossing, LTA evaluates whether the crossing would enhance connectivity to key amenities and major transport nodes, and also takes into account factors such as traffic volume and road geometry. If providing an at-grade pedestrian crossing would be dangerous or cause serious traffic congestion, LTA will consider other types of crossing facilities such as pedestrian overhead bridges or underpasses."
profile and success rate of singapore start-ups,Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) what is Singapore's trend of young people joining startups and the success rate of our startups as compared to that of other countries including US and Israel.,"Mr S Iswaran: Singapore’sstartup ecosystem has seen significant progress over the past decade.This is due, in part, to the concerted efforts of the Government,industry and other stakeholders to create an environment that isconducive for innovation and entrepreneurship.Young Singaporeans increasinglyrecognise entrepreneurship as a viable career pathway. Between 2010and 2016, the proportion of startup owners who are locals aged 35and below rose from 20% to 23%1.Surveys of young people in Singapore also affirm their growing entrepreneurialaspirations. For example, an NUS survey among tertiary studentsin Singapore reported that between 2011 and 2014, the percentageof students from Singapore Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs)with strong entrepreneurial intent rose from 37.5% to 62.5%2. A global survey in 2016 also found that 74% of millennialsin Singapore aim to become their own boss within a decade, comparedto 50% globally3.While there is no standarddefinition of success for startups, Singapore’s startup landscapehas grown steadily over the past decade. Between 2003 and 2016,the total number of startups in Singapore doubled from 22,000 to43,000. In particular, the number of high-tech startups4 increasedfrom 2,800 to 4,300 over the same period. Singapore has also nurturedfour of the five unicorns5 in Southeast Asia, namely,Sea (formerly known as Garena), Razer, Lazada and Grab.Given Singapore’s fairlyrecent entry into the startup scene, Singapore has fared well ininternational benchmarking studies of global startup ecosystems.For example, in Startup Genome’s 2017 Global Startup Ecosystem Report6, Singapore is ranked 12th overall,just below cities like Seattle and Paris and above Stockholm andVancouver. Silicon Valley and New York City are the top-ranked cities,with Tel Aviv ranking 6th."
authenticity and accuracy of description of jobs advertised on internet-based job portals,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked the Minister for Manpower whether there are checks and balances to ensure that jobs advertised on Internet-based job portals are authentic and accurately described.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: The national Jobs Bank has been designed to reduce the likelihood of having job postings that are inaccurate or advertise for positions that do not exist. Employers have to be Singapore-registered companies and provide their Unique Entity Number (UEN) to post jobs on Jobs Bank for accountability. Similarly, jobseekers apply for jobs only after logging in via SingPass. This creates an environment where jobseekers and employers can search for matches confidently.Jobs Bank users may also, at the click of a button, report to Workforce Singapore (WSG) regarding Jobs Bank advertisements which contain false information. Upon receiving such cases, WSG will work with the relevant agencies to investigate and where necessary, take action against the company responsible for the job advertisement.Jobseekers who choose to use other internet-based job portals are advised to select reputable sites where job advertisements are more likely to be authentic and accurately-described. While the Ministry of Manpower does not license Internet-based job portals, the advertising of fake jobs with criminal intent, such as cheating, may be subject to penalties under the Penal Code."
plans to cover domestic workers under employment act,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked the Minister for Manpower whether there are plans to cover domestic workers under the Employment Act.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: The Employment Act (EA) stipulates certain core provisions and working conditions for employees. We regularly review the EA to keep pace with the changing labour force profile and employment landscape.Domestic workers, including Foreign Domestic Workers (FDWs), are not covered by the EA. This is because given the personalized nature of domestic work, it is not practical to regulate certain aspects of their work, such as hours of work and work on public holidays as we do in the EA. This has not changed.The vast majority of domestic workers in Singapore are live-in FDWs whose rights and well-being are protected under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (EFMA). In recognition that FDWs can be vulnerable as most of them work alone and they live-in with their employers, the EFMA stipulates relevant provisions as found in the EA such as prompt payment of salary and rest days, as well as enhanced protections including requirements for employers to provide food and proper accommodation with adequate space and privacy.Domestic workers who encounter issues with their employers should approach MOM for advice and assistance as soon as possible."
compliance rate of employers in cases of non-payment of arrears,"Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked the Minister for Manpower for workers who have not been paid by their employers and have had their cases heard, what is the compliance rate of these employers paying them appropriately.","Mr Lim Swee Say: Between April and Dec 2017, the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM) and the Employment Claims Tribunal (ECT) concluded 3,750 employee salary claims where the employer was ordered to make payment to the worker. Salaries were fully recovered in about 92% of these orders.The remaining claims involved 139 employers. 133 of these employers ceased operations or faced business failure due to financial difficulties. TADM works with U Care Centre (UCC) of the National Trades Union Congress or the Migrant Workers’ Centre (MWC) to provide financial relief to lower-income workers who are unable to recover their salaries.Of the remaining six employers, one has appealed to the High Court. For the remaining five employers who did not pay even though they were not in financial difficulty, MOM will be prosecuting them under the Employment Act. At the same time, TADM is working with UCC and MWC to enforce the order against these five employers."
criteria for retention of central cluster over other buildings in dakota crescent,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for National Development with regard to Dakota Crescent (a) what criteria were used in deciding to retain the central cluster over other buildings in the estate; (b) how have stakeholder consultations with residents and Save Dakota Crescent factored into redevelopment and conservation decisions; and (c) how does the Ministry intend to work with stakeholders in deciding the future uses of the central cluster of buildings.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: In the planning of mature estates such as Dakota Crescent, we have to find a balance between preserving the built heritage and identity of the area, and injecting new facilities and homes to rejuvenate the precinct.To understand what was important to the community, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) engaged the Grassroots Advisor, Grassroots Leaders, community and heritage interest groups, residents, and other relevant stakeholders. A common feedback was that the central courtyard, where the Dove Playground was located, holds special meaning for the residents as it was where they used to gather.The central courtyard includes a cluster of six blocks which contains all the distinctive building typologies and architectural features of the Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT) flats found in the estate. Hence the decision to keep the central courtyard and the six blocks.We have received suggestions for the central cluster of buildings to be put to civic and institutional-related uses. This is currently being studied. The Government will continue to work closely with the relevant stakeholders in planning such uses. The remaining land will be redeveloped and intensified for public housing."
update on plans to enhance mandatory waste reporting requirements by supermarkets,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether he can provide an update on the Ministry's plans to enhance the mandatory waste reporting requirements by supermarkets; and (b) whether the Ministry plans to extend waste reporting to other premises that generate large amounts of waste including food waste.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Under the mandatory waste reporting requirements, owners of certain premises which generate large amounts of waste must report their waste and recyclables tonnages, waste reduction plans, and waste reduction targets to the National Environment Agency (NEA). This is to encourage them to improve their waste management systems, by drawing attention to the amount of waste produced and the potential for improvement.Currently, only shopping malls with a net lettable area of more than 4,600 square metres and hotels with more than 200 rooms are subject to these requirements. Supermarkets located in malls would have their waste data accounted for under the malls’ tonnage. There are no plans to introduce mandatory waste reporting requirements specifically for supermarkets.We will continue to monitor the waste generation of premises subjected to mandatory waste reporting. We will also consider extending the reporting requirements to other premises that generate large amounts of waste, such as industrial premises, bearing in mind the compliance costs."
number of applicants who applied for legal aid from 2013 to 2017,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Law for each year in the past five years, how many applicants applied for legal aid and of these applicants, how many failed at the stage of (i) the means test and (ii) the merits test.","Mr K Shanmugam: The Legal Aid Bureau provides Legal Aid, Legal Advice, and Legal Assistance (e.g. drafting of wills) to lower income Singaporeans and Permanent Residents. Legal Advice and Legal Assistance applicants only need to pass the means test, while Legal Aid applicants have to pass both the means test and the legal merits test.The data from 2013 to 2017 for those who applied for Legal Advice and Legal Assistance is set out in the following table:The data from 2013 to 2017 for those who applied for Legal Aid is set out in the following table:The number of applications which went through the merits test is lower than the number of applications which passed the preliminary means test, because many applicants of Legal Aid who passed the preliminary means test subsequently withdrew their applications, became uncontactable, or were later found to be above means. Applicants with urgent cases may also have been assisted under a Provisional Grant of Aid before they went through the merits test."
change in employers for existing work permit holders,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether any employers have been found collecting kickbacks to hire existing work permit holders who have changed employers; (b) what initiatives the Ministry has undertaken to match employers with existing work permit holders who are changing employers; and (c) what has been the rate of uptake of such initiatives.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: From 2015 to 2017, 21 employers11 were found collecting kickbacks to hire Work Permit Holders (WPHs) who had changed employers. The Ministry of Manpower takes a serious view of employers who collect kickbacks from WPHs. Employers found to do so are liable for a fine up to $30,000, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years, or to both.Since 2005, WPHs from the Construction sector have been allowed to change employers if their current employers agree. In 2015, Construction WPHs were also allowed to change employers near their work pass expiry if they are unable to come to a mutual agreement on the renewal of their work permits. These flexibilities were extended to the Process sector in 2017.WPHs who wish to change employers are able to seek new employment on their own, or engage the services of employment agencies. The Singapore Contractors Association Limited (SCAL) has also put in place a Foreign Construction Workers Directory System (FCWDS) to facilitate the matching of employers and existing construction workers. In addition, the Migrant Workers’ Centre (MWC) will assist WPHs with valid salary claims who seek employment.As of Dec 2017, approximately 131,000 WPHs have changed employers near their work pass expiry or upon employers’ consent."
cause of water pipe leakage at somerset road on 16 january 2018,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what is the cause of the water pipe leak at Somerset Road on 16 January 2018; (b) when was the pipe last checked as part of PUB's routine maintenance; and (c) what is the impact of continuous heavy rainfall on the underground soil where this water pipe is laid.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The water pipe leak at Somerset Road on 16 January 2018 was due to stress to the pipe caused by uneven soil settlement. We have isolated the leaking section of the pipe and put the rest of the pipeline back in service. The affected stretch of pipeline is in the process of being replaced under PUB’s Pipeline Renewal Programme.As part of its operation and maintenance regime, PUB carries out checks for leaks on its entire pipe network at least once a year, or more frequently where necessary. The pipe at Somerset Road, which is made of cast iron and laid in 1973, was last checked for leaks in December 2017, with no leak found. We have not observed any correlation between rainfall and the number of leaks.When leaks occur, PUB seeks to fix them in the shortest time possible as permitted by site conditions while minimising the disruption to customers and the public. PUB officers need time to identify the pipe and the valves that need to be shut so as to isolate the leak, identify the customers who are potentially affected, and set up the appropriate alternative supply provisions. For the leak at Somerset Road, temporary supply connections to these customers were set up in tandem with the repair works to limit the disruption to public. The repair works had to proceed carefully due to the need to minimise road closures and the presence of several other buried services belonging to the electrical and telecommunications companies near the site. PUB worked together with these companies to ensure that its repair works did not affect other critical services.To reduce the risk of pipe leaks, including those caused by uneven soil settlement, PUB has been laying pipes made of more resilient materials such as ductile iron and steel, and has adopted enhanced pipe-laying practices such as pipe bedding for better pipe support. Furthermore, we have put in place regulations to ensure that contractors take proper measures to prevent damage to our pipelines during construction activities.Besides these measures, PUB proactively replaces older pipes or pipes which are in less satisfactory condition under its Pipeline Renewal Programme and is targeting to replace 50 km of such pipes this year, a 20 km increase from last year."
number of identity cards reported lost annually,"Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) in the last three years, how many identity cards have been reported lost annually; (b) what is the trend over the last decade; (c) how many requests have there been for waiver of the replacement fee; and (d) whether the Ministry will implement a procedure where applicants who appeal for a waiver of the replacement fee can have their qualifying status verified through a central co-ordination point.","Mr K Shanmugam: Losing an Identity Card (IC) is a serious matter as the lost IC may be misused to commit identity fraud and for illicit transactions.In the last three years, the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) received around 31,500 reports of lost ICs annually. Around 13% were granted fee waivers for the replacement ICs.The trend of lost ICs has been relatively stable over the past decade.There is no fixed qualifying criteria for the waiver of the IC replacement fee. ICA will consider the circumstances of each case. It may grant a waiver in situations where it assesses that the loss of the IC was not due to negligence, but circumstances beyond the cardholder’s control, for example, if he or she had been a victim of crime. We are not able to develop a mechanism or system to automate such assessments, and which the public can use to check if they would qualify for waiver of the IC replacement fee."
profile of persons caught for offences related to personal mobility devices and efforts to reach out to elderly pmd users,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the profile of persons caught for offences related to their personal mobility devices (PMD); and (b) what are the efforts to reach out to the elderly PMD users who may not be aware of the PMD regulations.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: In 2017, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and Traffic Police caught about 460 personal mobility device (PMD) riders for the offence of riding PMDs on roads, and issued about 1,800 advisories for unsafe riding behaviours on public paths. About a quarter of these persons were over 50 years old.LTA has launched several campaigns to raise awareness amongst cyclists and PMD users on safe riding habits and the active mobility rules and code of conduct. The campaign messages have been translated into vernacular languages and disseminated widely. In addition, LTA also works with Active Mobility Patrol volunteers to engage and educate the public, including the elderly, on safe riding practices.Elderly PMD users can also learn more about safe riding behaviours, proper use of active mobility infrastructure, and PMD regulations from the Safe Riding Programme jointly developed by LTA and the Singapore Road Safety Council, which is available at designated community centres."
"update on design, build and sell scheme for hdb flats","Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for National Development whether he can provide for an update on the Ministry's plan to review the Design, Build and Sell Scheme (DBSS) for HDB flats.","Mr Lawrence Wong: The land sales for the Design, Build and Sell Scheme (DBSS) has been suspended since 2012, and MND has no plans to reactivate the scheme.We remain focused on ensuring that homebuyers have access to a variety of affordable housing options, especially young couples who are buying their first home. These objectives can be met with new BTO flats and Executive Condominiums, as well as the many housing options available in the resale market."
high covered shelter for boarding and alighting of passengers at bus stops,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Transport whether there is a plan to enhance existing bus stops to include a high cover of 4.5 metres and above that extends into the bus bay so as to provide a covered shelter for boarding and alighting of passengers.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Where space permits, such shelters will be built, with priority given to the most heavily utilised bus-stops, especially those connected to MRT stations. More than a quarter of the bus stops at MRT stations have cantilever shelters."
underground connection between marina bay mrt station and downtown mrt station,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether there will be an underground connection between Marina Bay MRT Station and Downtown MRT station; and (b) if not, whether LTA can consider building a permanent covered linkway connecting both stations on the road surface level.",Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The Marina Bay and Downtown MRT stations will be connected via an underground link. The Land Transport Authority will work with the Urban Redevelopment Authority to provide for the underground link as part of its future plans.
annual breakdown of sexual harassment incidents on public transport from 2013 to 2017,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Transport (a) how many incidents of sexual harassment on public transport have been reported each year in the last five years; and (b) whether the public transport operators are required to implement a public safety policy with strategies to keep public transport free of sexual harassment.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The following table indicates the number of reported cases of Outrage of Modesty (OM) on public transport over the past five years.The Land Transport Authority (LTA), the Public Transport Security Command of the Singapore Police Force (TransCom), and the Public Transport Operators (PTOs) have taken steps to educate commuters about OM, including several public education campaigns over the years. Commuters are encouraged to report such cases, and every report is treated seriously.LTA, TransCom and the PTOs will continue to work together to tackle OM on public transport and improve the safety and security of our commuters."
update on no-wrong-door policy and first responder protocol,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Prime Minister (a) whether the No Wrong Door (NWD) policy introduced in 2004 and the First Responder Protocol (FRP) introduced in 2012 are practised by every Government agency; and (b) how do these two policies ensure public service officers are empowered to fully resolve the public's issues instead of finding the quickest solution to pass the issue on to another agency.,"Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): The Public Service strives to adopt a customer-centric approach in dealing with feedback and requests from members of the public. The No Wrong Door (NWD) policy and the First Responder Protocol (FRP) were introduced as part of many efforts to ensure that feedback from the public are addressed quickly and effectively. Under NWD, the agency that receives feedback on an issue not under its purview should identify the agency responsible and ensure that the agency will take up the case, before putting that agency in touch with the person who provided the feedback. If the issue has no clear owner, the agency that receives the feedback will apply FRP and identify an agency with some domain expertise. This latter agency, also known as the First Responder, will promptly resolve the inter-agency request, while the back-end policy and operational issues are being sorted out.Public officers at the frontline are trained on these protocols. The Civil Service College conducts regular case simulation workshops for frontline teams, to familiarise officers with the procedures and standards. Many large agencies include these requirements as part of their service training programmes, and have also developed innovations to enhance seamlessness. For example, the CPF Board has an internal virtual assistant to help officers provide accurate answers to members' CPF queries and identify the right contacts to help them. Agencies are audited on a regular basis on their compliance with the procedures and service standards.The Municipal Services Office (MSO), established in 2014 to coordinate municipal issues that span across multiple agencies, is an example of how the Public Service has moved from ""No Wrong Door"" to ""Just One Door"". Its OneService app allows members of the public to provide feedback on all municipal issues without having to know which agency is in charge. This is made possible by a backend routing system that allows seamless case referral between agencies based on parameters such as land, issue and asset ownership.MSO has also worked with partner agencies to establish First Responders in different domains. For example, MSO has brought PUB and the Town Councils together to determine who should serve as the First Responder in different types of water-related issues, so that residents no longer have to face multiple site inspections from both PUB and their Town Council. Other First Responders include LTA for the maintenance of connectivity-related infrastructure like park connectors, footpaths, and footbridges, NParks for public greenery maintenance, AVA for animal-related issues, and NEA for public cleanliness. There are also escalation mechanisms to ensure complex cases or cases with unclear ownership are escalated to the appropriate authorities for prompt action. Collectively, these mechanisms strengthen agencies’ practice of NWD and FRP in the delivery of municipal services."
measures to ensure cashless transactions originating in singapore are encrypted and secure,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Prime Minister (a) what are the measures in place to ensure all cashless transactions originating in Singapore are encrypted and secure; and (b) what are the contingency plans in place in the event of network breakdowns and power failures.,"Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): MAS takes seriously the security of electronic payment transactions. Encryption is one of the safeguards against cyber threats and fraud concerning e-payments, but not the only one needed. The specific measures that payment service providers must put in place depend on the risks associated with different e-payment modes, and they include:a. Strong authentication such as the use of biometrics or dynamic passcodes to verify customers' identity and to authorise electronic payment transactions;b. Encryption to protect sensitive information against unauthorised access during data storage and transmission;c. Fraud monitoring to facilitate timely detection and blocking of suspicious transactions;d. Transaction notification via SMS or Email to alert customers when transactions exceed a specific threshold or when unusual payment behaviours are observed.The contingency plans that have to be put in place for a network breakdown or power failures, will depend on how each system is designed and the criticality of the service provided. FIs are required by MAS to have plans, such as back-up power supply or an alternate telecommunications service provider, to ensure continuity of service during disruptions.MAS conducts periodic reviews of FIs to assess the adequacy of controls to manage technology and business continuity risks."
use of supplementary retirement scheme monies for purchase of singapore savings bonds,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Prime Minister whether the Government can review and allow the use of Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) monies for the purchase of Singapore Savings Bonds.,"Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): Singapore Savings Bonds (SSBs) were introduced to provide Singaporeans with a safe and flexible way to invest for the long-term. For those wanting a low-risk retirement savings instrument, SSBs are a good alternative to cash held in savings accounts. As of 1 February 2018, more than 55,000 individuals hold over $1.8 billion of SSBs.Given the objectives of SSBs, we intend to allow the use of Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) monies for the purchase of these bonds. It will enhance the range of low-cost products available on the SRS platform. However, the allocation mechanism for SSBs will continue to ensure that small savers amongst the public get preference in the event of over-subscription.MAS is making IT system changes to bring this about, and will make an announcement when it is ready."
regulatory requirements for private hire cars and drivers,"Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the current number of private hire cars on the road; (b) whether there will be further regulatory requirements for private hire cars and drivers; and (c) if so, what will these requirements be and the timeframe for implementation.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: As of 31 December 2017, there were approximately 47,000 cars that are registered to offer private hire car (PHC) services.We will continue to monitor the situation and review our regulations regularly. Currently, these cars have to be affixed with tamper-evident decals. In addition, PHC drivers are required to hold a Private Hire Car Driver’s Vocational Licence (PDVL) and are subjected to the same demerit point system that applies to taxi drivers."
ban on errant e-scooter owners with repeated offences,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry keeps track of e-scooter owners and whether it will consider banning them from owning e-scooters when they continue to flout regulations after repeated warnings and fines.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The Land Transport Authority (LTA) does not maintain any records on the ownership of personal mobility devices (PMDs) such as e-scooters.The Active Mobility Advisory Panel (AMAP) has been tasked to review the regulatory regime for PMDs, including the need to register motorised PMDs, and will surface its recommendations to the Government later this year."
setting up of inter-ministerial committee to look into better integration of all social classes in singapore,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Prime Minister whether an inter-Ministerial committee can be set up to look into better integration of all social classes in Singapore.,2 Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Prime Minister (a) whether the income gap between different income groups has widened in the past 10 years; and (b) whether there are any plans by Government to continue to ensure the income gap between different income groups will not cause social divide and ensure social harmony and social mobility for Singaporeans.Mr Lee Hsien Loong:
compensation for passengers injured in joo koon mrt-train collision,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Transport (a) how were the passengers who were onboard the trains involved in the Joo Koon MRT-train collision compensated for their injuries, medical expenses and other loss and damages suffered; and (b) which party is responsible for footing these expenses and damages.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: As the rail operator, SMRT has reimbursed and will continue to reimburse the injured passengers' medical and other related expenses."
update on road-widening works along clementi road between jalan anak bukit and ayer rajah expressway,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Transport when will the major road-widening works along Clementi Road between Jalan Anak Bukit and the Ayer Rajah Expressway be completed.,Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The road widening works along Clementi Road between Jalan Anak Bukit and the junction of Clementi Road with Ulu Pandan Road was completed last December. A second phase of works between Commonwealth Avenue West and AYE will be completed later this month. The last phase of the Clementi Road widening works between Ulu Pandan Road and Commonwealth Avenue West will be completed by March 2018.
update on protection of public spaces against terrorist incidents using vehicles,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is the progress on hardening and protecting our public spaces against terrorist incidents using vehicles; (b) how are commercial operators contributing to the protection efforts; and (c) what are the future plans to design public spaces with security factored in.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) is working with other Government agencies to enhance security measures in public spaces against hostile vehicle attacks. This includes existing spaces, and selected new ones in the pipeline where measures can be designed upfront.We adopt a risk-based approach in identifying locations to fortify, and the type and extent of measures to put in place. We have to strike a balance between enhancing security, the cost of the measures, and the impact on the public's daily activities.We have started to deploy anti-hostile vehicle measures in the Orchard Road area. Crash-rated barriers and bollards were installed in some locations along Orchard Road in late 2017. More will be progressively installed.There are plans to install similar barriers in other areas later this year. We have been consulting the local business associations, such as to assess the viability of the proposed measures.Commercial building owners also have a part to play to protect their premises. Under the Infrastructure Protection Act, owners of large or iconic buildings, and critical infrastructures that deliver essential services, will be required to undergo a security-by-design process. They will have to incorporate measures to address security threats in the design of the building before it is constructed, or for an existing building, when it undergoes major renovation.In addition, as part of the Safety and Security Watch Group and SGSecure engagements by the Police, building owners are given practical advice on how to mitigate vehicle threats. Building owners can also refer to the Guidelines for Enhancing Building Security in Singapore published by MHA, for advice on best practices and solutions to protect their premises"
number of singaporeans on mid-career switch programmes in 2017,"Ms Tin Pei Ling asked the Minister for Manpower over the past one year (a) how many Singaporeans have undertaken mid-career switch programmes such as Professional Conversion and Place and Train; (b) of them, how many are retrenched PMETs and discouraged unemployed workers; (c) how many of were eventually successful and secured a job; and (d) what are the reasons for those who did not get accepted into the programmes.","Mr Lim Swee Say: Under the Adapt and Grow initiative, the Professional Conversion Programmes (PCPs) and Place-and-Train (PnT) programmes help PMETs and Rank and File RnF workers address job-skills mismatches respectively.PCPs provide training and salary support to help mid-career PMETs reskill, so that they can move into new and different occupations or sectors that have good prospects and opportunities for progression. Over the past one year, more than 3,300 local PMETs were placed. Among those placed, about 10% were previously retrenched or unemployed for 6 months or more, that is, Long Term Unemployed (LTU).Similarly, PnT programmes provide training and salary support to help RnF workers reskill to take on new jobs in different sectors. Last year, more than 1,800 locals were placed through these programmes. Among those placed, about 5% were previously retrenched or LTU.As both PCPs and PnT programmes are structured such that every jobseeker is hired by an employer before undergoing training, every worker on these programmes would have successfully secured a job. Applicants who are unable to secure employment and hence do not get into these programmes are being assisted through other programmes. For example, the Career Support Programme (CSP) provides salary support to encourage employers to hire mid-career PMETs who have been retrenched or are LTU. Since its inception in October 2015, over 1,100 PMETs have been supported through CSP, with more than 80% being LTU or retrenched at the point of placement."
measures to protect users against security flaws of wi-fi devices and services,Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked the Minister for Communications and Information regarding the security flaws which place wi-fi devices at risk (a) what is the impact on our free public wi-fi service Wireless@SG; and (b) what measures are being taken to protect users.,"Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim: IMDA works closely with its appointed telecom service providers to ensure the security of the Wireless@SG public Wi-Fi network.IMDA as the programme owner ensures that the Wireless@SG operators adhere to the stipulated standards on identity management, login and security. Its appointed telecom service operators – M1, Singtel, StarHub, Y5ZONE and MyRepublic, are responsible for the network design and implementation.In terms of security, the Wireless@SG operators are required to ensure that their infrastructure meets international best practices (for example, Open Web Applications Security Project). Depending on the vulnerabilities found, all operators will work closely with IMDA and the relevant authorities to address them promptly, such as implementing patches released by the manufacturers and disabling vulnerable components.Nevertheless, users are encouraged to be vigilant when they access public Wi-Fi networks. Users should choose password protected and encrypted hotspots (for example, Wireless@SGx) over those that are not. Users should also consider using encrypted channels such as Virtual Private Network (VPN) and HTTPS when processing personal or sensitive information.

outpatient non-chronic illnesses treated and cost of medication in 2016 and 2017,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Health (a) what are the non-chronic illnesses that outpatients are largely treated for; and (b) what is the average cost of medication for such outpatient treatments over the last two years.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Common outpatient non-chronic illnesses seen at the primary care setting include the common cold, diarrhea, vomiting, sprains and strains.Between 2015 and 2016, the average total bill size of a non-chronic attendance at polyclinics was about $16 for Singapore Citizens after Government subsidies. This includes an average cost of medications of $4.Over the same period, Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) Blue and Pioneer Generation (PG) cardholders at General Practitioner (GP) clinics participating in CHAS paid slightly more than $20 per visit on average for non-chronic attendances, including medications. Before CHAS subsidies were applied, their average bill was $45 per visit, about half of which was medication costs.At our public healthcare institutions, including polyclinics, patients who have concerns about their medical bills, may apply for financial assistance, such as Medifund."
"annual wage supplements for workers with monthly gross salary below $2,000","Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how many workers earning below $2,000 in monthly gross salary have received Annual Wage Supplements (AWS) in the last three years; and (b) what efforts are being made to encourage employers to give AWS to their workers.","Mr Lim Swee Say: The proportion of full-time resident employees earning below $2,000 who received bonuses including the Annual Wage Supplement (AWS) has remained stable at about 50% over the last decade.Employers and unions share the flexibility in structuring staff remuneration together under our Flexible and Performance Based wage systems. Broadly speaking, rank and file employees have more of their annual package allocated to fixed monthly salaries while monthly or annual variable payments tend to comprise a bigger share for those in more senior positions. MOM therefore looks at total annual wages when monitoring wage increases. Over the past five years, total wages (including annual and monthly variable components) at the 20th percentile have risen by 4.1% per annum, comparable to the growth at the median."

number of vehicular accidents involving singaporeans overseas from 2015 to 2017,"Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) over the past three years, what is the number of vehicular accidents which occurred overseas involving Singaporeans; (b) whether the issuer of the International Driving Licence is required to advise drivers of the precautions needed in different destinations; and (c) what other measures is the Ministry considering to reduce the incidences of driving accidents involving Singaporeans overseas.","Mr K Shanmugam: We do not have data on the number of overseas road traffic accidents involving Singaporeans.Traffic Police (TP) leverages social media to publish advisories and videos on safe driving overseas. The Automobile Association of Singapore (AAS), a close working partner and the authority for granting the International Driving Permit in Singapore, provides pointers on safe driving overseas through its website and booklets available at its premises. TP will continue to work with the Singapore Road Safety Council and AAS to raise awareness among Singaporeans of the precautions they should take when driving overseas. These include familiarising themselves with local traffic rules, road conditions and driving culture."
number of traffic accidents involving overseas visitors who drive in singapore,Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) how many visitors to Singapore drive around during their stay and get into traffic accidents; and (b) whether the numbers are significant and a cause for concern.,"Mr K Shanmugam: From 2015 to 2017, an average of about 240 short-term visitors to Singapore were involved in road traffic accidents annually. This accounts for about 1.7% of all drivers involved in accidents in the same period. The numbers are low.Traffic Police (TP) reminds foreign motorists crossing land checkpoints to drive safely in Singapore, through distributing brochures and erecting billboards. To deter the commission of traffic offences, TP conducts regular operations at the checkpoints targeting foreign motorists with outstanding summonses.Any policy intervention might be excessive, at this point, with knock on effects on other areas."
annual breakdown of workplace-health related claims under work injury compensation act from 2015 to 2017,"Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Manpower (a) in each of the last three years, what is the number of claims under the Work Injury Compensation Act that are workplace-health related; and (b) what is the total amount claimed.","Mr Lim Swee Say: There were 186, 211 and 202 workplace health related claims awarded under the Work Injury Compensation (WIC) Act in 2015, 2016 and 2017 respectively. They made up less than 1.5% of total WIC claims annually. For the last three years, the workplace health related claims amounted to a total of $24.3 million, which is about 7.4% of the total WIC payout.While the number of workplace health-related claims remains small, MOM and tripartite partners are working together to better address work-related ill health as part of our Total Workplace Safety and Health Plan."
singapore citizens with registered johor bahru home addresses on identity cards,Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for Home Affairs how many Singapore citizens currently have home addresses in Johor Bahru registered on their identity cards.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The current entry format does not allow collation of this data accurately.Further, even if the information were available, there are a number of considerations, on whether such information should be released. The release of data on the number of Singaporeans, in specific locations, in the region, as well as around the world, may, for example, not be in the interests of the Singaporeans in some of these locations.In the context of Johor Bahru, our assessment is that the information should not be released."
"female students taking up engineering courses at ite, polytechnic and university","Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (a) in the past five years, what is the number of female students taking up engineering courses at the ITE, polytechnic and university levels; (b) how many of these female graduates eventually took up engineering jobs; and (c) whether the Ministry has any plans to encourage more female students to take up engineering courses.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: In the last five years, the proportion of female students who took up engineering courses at the ITE, polytechnics and universities has remained fairly stable, at around 20% of the total engineering cohort, or about 3,600 students each year. Based on the Graduate Employment Surveys conducted in 2016, around 70% of them who were in full-time permanent employment reported that they worked in engineering-related jobs after graduation.We welcome more students, male and female to consider engineering as a career, and have various initiatives and programmes to encourage more to do so. For example, at the secondary schools, Applied Learning Programmes (ALP) in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) enable students to apply their knowledge and skills in authentic situations, to address real-world problems, and offer opportunities to interact with engineering professionals. More than 60% of our secondary schools offer ALP in STEM areas.In addition, the polytechnics have pooled their efforts to promote engineering diploma programmes to secondary school students. The talks will feature industry practitioners who share about their passion for engineering and why they chose it as a career. The polytechnics also reach out to school teachers and involve them in industry learning journeys and experiential workshops."
primary school vacancies in chua chu kang,"Mr Zaqy Mohamad asked the Minister for Education (Schools) (a) whether the number of primary school vacancies in Chua Chu Kang is sufficient given the influx of new BTOs in the Keat Hong area, particularly for applicants seeking a school within 2 km of their home; (b) what proportion of primary 1 school applicants living in Keat Hong division have been able to secure a school within 2km of their homes; and (c) what is the current waiting list of Southview Primary School, Concord Primary School and Chua Chu Kang Primary School.","Mr Ng Chee Meng: MOE regularly reviews the demand and supply trends at the national and regional levels to ensure that there are sufficient school places for school-going children, taking into account the current and projected population as well as planned housing development programmes.Due to the families that are moving into the recently completed HDB BTO flats in Choa Chu Kang, we have projected a slight increase in the localised demand for primary school places. As such, we have increased the number of school vacancies in some of the schools in Choa Chu Kang. There should be sufficient primary school places to meet the increased demand from these families.The proportion of P1-going children who secured a P1 place in their first-choice school or a school within two kilometres of their homes averaged about 98% nationally for the 2017 Primary One Registration Exercise. The outcomes for individual constituencies would typically hover close to the national average, and this is the case too for Keat Hong division.South View Primary School, Concord Primary School and Chua Chu Kang Primary School currently have a wait list for some students who wish to be transferred there. These include children who are currently studying in other nearby primary schools. For information, there are available vacancies in other nearby primary schools, such as Teck Whye Primary School and Kranji Primary School."
foreign students defaulting on repayment of study loans from local banks and institutions,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (a) what is the rate of default in the repayment of study loans taken out by foreign students from our banks and other local institutions in each of the past five years; (b) what actions have been taken to effect recovery against such defaulters; and (c) what is the rate of cases where full recovery has been made through such enforcement actions.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: To ensure that our Singaporean students are not denied a tertiary education due to their financial circumstances, the Government provides loans to students at our publicly-funded tertiary institutions. These loans are also extended to international students who need some assistance.On average, over the last five years, 3.9% of the total outstanding Government loans taken up by international students is in default and deemed unrecoverable, after exhausting all recovery efforts. For international students who default on their loans, they can face adverse consequences should they apply to work or reside in Singapore.Commercial banks also offer study loans but based on the data reported by banks to the Credit Bureau, study loans granted to foreigners was less than 0.0001% of the total banking assets in Singapore. As they make up only a very small share of total banking system exposure, MAS does not collect the data on these loans, including the default rate."
number of hdb blocks projected to be redeveloped under the selective en-bloc redevelopment scheme over next 10-20 years,Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for National Development how many HDB blocks does the Ministry project to redevelop under the Selective En-Bloc Redevelopment Scheme over the next 10-20 years when many HDB flats will have less than 60 years left on their leases and progressively lose their value until the lease run-out date.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS) is implemented on a highly selective basis. The Government will announce SERS for suitable precincts only where feasible, after a careful evaluation on a site-by-site basis, taking into consideration various factors such as the redevelopment potential, availability of suitable replacement sites, and the Government's financial resources. We do not share details on the blocks to be redeveloped or other related information ahead of the SERS exercise, as these are market-sensitive information."
holders of wsq advanced certificate in training and assessment who secured jobs as trainers of wsq programmes within a year of completion,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) in each of the last five years, what is the proportion of persons who obtained the WSQ Advanced Certificate in Training and Assessment (ACTA) had gone on to secure jobs as trainers of WSQ programmes within a year of obtaining their certificate.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: Based on a survey conducted by SkillsFuture Singapore in 2017, over 60% of the respondents who attained an ACTA between July 2015 and June 2016 were performing, on a full or part-time basis, one or more training-related roles, such as working as a trainer, adjunct adult educator, training management practitioner, or human capital management practitioner. A further 25% of respondents were employed in non-TAE related roles."
land subsidence and mitigation measures planned,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether the Ministry has evidence pertaining to whether land subsidence is taking place in Singapore; (b) if so, what are the future consequences of this; and (c) what policy actions are being planned to mitigate these consequences.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Land subsidence refers to the loss of surface elevation when soil gradually settles and compacts over time. Some degree of land subsidence happens in all countries, due to natural phenomena such as tectonic motion, as well as human action, such as building and construction. Singapore lies away from the margins of tectonic plates, and our ground predominantly consists of stable geological materials. Hence, we have not seen evidence of land subsidence in Singapore that would raise cause for concern."
update on building of new hawker centre in choa chu kang and all remaining hawker centres,Mr Zaqy Mohamad asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether there are any updates on the proposed location and timeline for the building of a new hawker centre in Choa Chu Kang; and (b) when will the Ministry complete its study and announce the timeline for all remaining hawker centres that are part of this initiative.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The Government has committed to building 20 new hawker centres by 2027, focusing on new HDB towns such as Punggol, Bidadari, Sengkang and Choa Chu Kang. So far, announcements have been made for 17 of these new hawker centres, of which seven have started operations.The remaining hawker centres, which includes a new centre at Choa Chu Kang, are at various stages of planning and development. We will announce the location and development timelines for these centres as soon as they are ready."
pensioners under fixed amount on ward medical benefits scheme and co-payment on ward medical benefits scheme,Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the current number and percentage of pensioners under the Fixed Amount on Ward (FAW) medical benefits scheme who have withdrawn their Medisave completely; (b) what is the current number and percentage of pensioners under Co-payment on Ward (CPW) medical benefits scheme who have not met 30% of their cohort's applicable Basic Healthcare Sum (BHS); and (c) whether CPW pensioners can withdraw the excess amount above their required BHS from their Medisave accounts.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: FAW pensioners are entitled to comprehensive medical benefits at government healthcare institutions, and are hence not required to set aside any Medisave. However, they may opt to set aside Medisave. 1,236, or 99.6% of FAW pensioners, have zero Medisave balances.CPW pensioners need to set aside 30% of their cohort's applicable Basic Healthcare Sum (BHS). In 2016, 8,200, or 50% of CPW pensioners have Medisave balances below 30% of their cohort’s applicable BHS.For all CPF members, any Medisave monies above their respective BHS is automatically transferred to their other CPF accounts. FAW and CPW pensioners will be able to withdraw these monies if they had met their applicable Retirement Sum."
additional buyer's stamp duty fees and qualifying certificate extension charges paid by developers since implementation of rules,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development (a) how much Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty (ABSD) fees and Qualifying Certificate (QC) extension charges have been paid by developers each year since the rules were implemented; (b) how many unsold residential property units have been subjected to both ABSD fees and QC charges, categorised by years of vacancy as at 31 December 2017; and (c) what is the projected number of unsold residential property units that will be subjected to these fees and charges in 2018.","Mr Lawrence Wong: As of 31 December 2017, developers have paid about $200 million in Additional Buyer’s Stamp Duty (ABSD) fees, and about $180 million in Qualifying Certificate (QC) extension charges, since the regimes were implemented.As of 31 December 2017, no residential development has been subjected to both ABSD and QC extension charges on their unsold units.Around 80 developments (with a total of about 750 unsold units) could be subjected to these fees and charges in 2018 if either or both disposal conditions are not met."
plan to increase supply of executive condominiums in next five years,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development whether there is a plan to increase the supply of executive condominiums in the next five years on confirmed list of land sales and what is the projected number of such units for each year.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: In planning for the supply of Executive Condominiums (EC), the Government takes into consideration many factors, such as the existing unsold stock of ECs, take-up rate of new EC units, and prevailing market sentiments. These factors fluctuate from year to year. Hence, the Government monitors the EC market closely and calibrates the supply of ECs accordingly.For the first half of 2018, there are three EC sites in the Government Land Sales Programme, which could yield a total of about 1,700 units. One of the sites is on the Confirmed List. The other two sites are on the Reserve List and could be triggered for sale if there is strong demand from developers."
proportion of births versus deaths of those aged 65 years and above registered at private and public hospitals,"Ms Sun Xueling asked the Minister for Health for each of the last three years, what has been the proportion of (i) births registered and (ii) deaths registered for those aged 65 years and above, in private versus public hospitals.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: The proportion of births registered at public hospitals was 41.7%, 43.3% and 44.7% in 2014, 2015 and 2016 respectively. For private hospitals, the figures were 58.0%, 56.4% and 54.9% respectively. A small proportion of births occurred at other locations such as personal residences.For elderly decedents aged 65 years and older, 57.7%, 59.0% and 59.1% of deaths were registered at public hospitals in 2014, 2015 and 2016 respectively. Less than 2% of elderly deaths were registered in private hospitals from 2014 to 2016. Other places of death, which include nursing homes, charitable institutions, and personal residences, comprised approximately 40% of elderly deaths in the period 2014-2016."
industry transformation map for offshore marine and oil and gas industries,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) when will the industry transformation map for the offshore marine and oil and gas industries be ready.,"Mr S Iswaran: The Economic Development Board, as the lead agency, has been working closely with industry stakeholders, trade associations such as the Association of Singapore Marine Industries, unions such as the Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering Employees’ Union, and other government agencies (for example, the Agency for Science, Technology and Research, International Enterprise Singapore, JTC Corporation, Standards, Productivity and Innovation Board, SkillsFuture Singapore and Workforce Singapore) on the Marine & Offshore Engineering Industry Transformation Map (M&OE ITM). The M&OE ITM will be launched on 22 February 2018."
"breakdown of citizens, prs and foreigners in singapore owning one or more private residential properties and also hdb flats and number of such properties owned","Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the current number of citizens, PRs and foreigners in Singapore who own (i) one (ii) two (iii) three to ten and (iv) more than ten private residential properties respectively; and (b) how many of them also own a HDB flat.","Mr Lawrence Wong: About 381,000 Singapore citizens, Singapore Permanent Residents, and foreigners own one private residential property in Singapore. About 59,000 own two private residential properties; 20,000 own three to ten private residential properties; and fewer than 200 own more than ten private residential properties. Of these private residential property owners, 15% also own an HDB flat."
employers failing to issue proper employment contracts to workers,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how many employers have been reported to the Ministry in the past five years for not issuing employment contracts to their workers; (b) what is the age group of these affected workers; (c) what action has been taken against such employers; and (d) what is the redress for these workers when their employers refuse to issue proper employment contracts that stipulate their wages, work hours and duration of the contract.","Mr Lim Swee Say: To help employees better understand their employment terms and to minimise employment disputes, the Employment Act requires employers to provide each employee with the key employment terms in written form. The required key employment terms include salary, hours of work and employment benefits (eg, annual leave), as well as the duration of employment for term contracts.Employers who fail to issue key employment terms may be subjected to an administrative penalty of a fine of up to $200 for each breach.Since the requirement was implemented on 1 April 2016, 105 employers have been issued with advisory notices for failing to issue key employment terms. No fines have been imposed as all the employers were cooperative and rectified the breaches. None of them was a repeat offender. We do not track the age group of the employees affected.Employees who are not provided with written key employment terms can approach MOM for assistance."
study on noise decibel levels caused by mrt trains passing through keat hong crest and keat hong pride,"Mr Zaqy Mohamad asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the Ministry has studied the noise decibel levels caused by MRT trains passing through Keat Hong Crest and Keat Hong Pride; (b) if so, whether these levels exceed the 65-decibel level that is the threshold for noise disturbance under NEA guidelines; and (c) what are the criteria for the estate to qualify for noise barriers.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: LTA's preliminary finding suggests that the noise level at the blocks nearest to the MRT lines is lower than NEA's recommended threshold of 67 decibels (averaged over an hour). However, we will be doing a more in-depth island-wide study. For the installation of noise barriers, LTA will prioritise areas where the noise level has exceeded 67 decibels (averaged over an hour)."
damages to equipment or facilities caused by bishan-braddell mrt tunnel flooding incident,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Transport (a) what damage to equipment or facilities has been sustained as a result of the recent episode of flooding in the Bishan-Braddell MRT tunnel; and (b) what is the estimated cost of repairing this damage and restoring the train system to full pre-flood functionality.,Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The tunnel flooding that occurred on 7 October 2017 between Bishan and Braddell MRT stations submerged trackside equipment as well as components installed on the undercarriage of the train that had stalled in the tunnel. The cost of repairs and replacements amounted to about $2 million. This was borne by SMRT.
adding bus service between choa chu kang and bukit batok town centre for keat hong and hong kah north residents,"Mr Zaqy Mohamad asked the Minister for Transport with about 15,000 and 30,000 new residents moving into the new BTOs in Keat Hong and Hong Kah North, whether the Ministry will consider adding a bus service between Choa Chu Kang and Bukit Batok Town Centre that plies through Brickland Road and Gombak MRT station.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: To cater to the new residents in Keat Hong and Hong Kah North, LTA has introduced three bus services that connect to the Choa Chu Kang and Bukit Panjang MRT Stations and Bus Interchanges for onward journeys. LTA will continue to monitor travel patterns and make adjustments to bus services where necessary."
eldercare leave for employees,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Health (a) how many companies currently provide eldercare leave to their employees; (b) whether there has been an increase in consumption of such leave; and (c) how can the Ministry encourage more companies to provide such leave.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: There is no mandatory reporting to the Government on the take-up rate of parent care leave across the private sector. According to the Ministry of Manpower (MOM)'s Conditions of Employment Survey 2016, 19% of employers1 provided paid parental care leave for employees to take care of their parents when sick in 2016, up from 6% in 2008.The Government encourages employers to provide more family-friendly practices, including family-related leave benefits, via a few ways. First, the Civil Service has introduced two days of parent care leave per year. Around four in 10 civil servants utilised the parent care leave in 2016.Second, MOM's Work-Life Grant funds each company up to $160,000 over four years to implement Flexible Work Arrangements (FWAs)2 to help employees better manage work and family responsibilities, which may include caregiving for aged parents.Third, MOM also launched the Tripartite Standard on FWAs in October 2017 to encourage more employers to publicly commit to offering FWAs in their companies. As of 2016, 67% of employees work in companies that offer at least one formal FWA, up from 56% in 2011. Close to eight in 10 employers also provide unplanned time-off or ad-hoc teleworking for their employees to attend to personal matters.MOH will continue to work with other Ministries and tripartite partners to encourage employers to adopt family-friendly practices, and to strengthen support for working caregivers."
wheelchair transport assistance for low-income families,"Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Health (a) how many residents currently require wheelchair transport assistance, especially with accompaniment; (b) what is the support provided for low-income families; and (c) how can the Ministry work with the public transport operators and ride-hailing companies to increase the capacity to cater for an ageing population.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Seniors requiring wheelchair transport assistance can apply for funding under the Seniors' Mobility and Enabling Fund (SMF) to offset the cost of wheelchairs and other assistive devices, as well as transport services to MOH-funded eldercare and dialysis services. Based on our estimates, over the last five years, 23,000 seniors received subsidies for wheelchairs under the SMF, and 6,000 seniors who are wheelchair users benefited from our transport subsidies. We do not have other data that provide comprehensive information on the total number of residents who require wheelchairs.We have also been working with transport providers to support seniors who are frail or who require wheelchairs. For example, MOH-funded Medical Escort and Transport (MET) services provide transport and accompaniment services for such seniors who need to attend medical appointments at hospitals, specialist outpatient clinics and polyclinics. Seniors from lower income families receive higher levels of funding under both the SMF and MET.To increase transport options for frail and wheelchair-bound seniors, the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) is appointing centralised providers to operate transport services to eldercare centres. AIC has also trained drivers from our taxi companies and more recently, drivers from Uber, to better cater to passengers who are in wheelchairs."
tax revenue collections,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Finance (a) whether the tax revenues collected from the top 20 per cent of income earners have been declining or increasing in the past 10 years; and (b) what are the changes in tax revenue in each age group for the past 10 years.,"Mr Heng Swee Keat: The personal income taxes collected from the top 20 per cent of taxpayers have more than doubled between Year of Assessment 2007 and 2017, from $4.3 billion to $9.8 billion. This is due to both an increase in the number of taxpayers, and higher amounts collected from each taxpayer on average. Generally, this trend is observed across all age groups within the top 20 per cent of taxpayers."
breakdown of annual financial savings or assets owned by singaporean households and individuals from 2013 to 2017,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Trade) what is the level of financial savings or financial assets owned by Singaporean households and individuals in each of the past five years, broken down according to the (i) mean (ii) median (iii) 10th percentile and (iv) 90th percentile.",Mr Lim Hng Kiang: The aggregate level of financial assets owned by Singapore’s household sector6 in each of the past five years is provided in Table 1. Data on the amount of financial assets owned by households and individuals in the different income percentiles is not available.
spontaneous vehicle fire incidents,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the number of incidents of spontaneous vehicle fires per year since 2010; (b) whether there are any patterns in such incidents by vehicle category or brand; (c) what is the breakdown of the causes of such fires; and (d) what are the steps being taken by LTA to reduce such incidents.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: There were about 200 cases of spontaneous vehicle fires every year since 2014. Figures prior to 2014 are not readily available.Among these vehicles which caught fire, about 60% were motorcars and 20%, light goods vehicles. Based on SCDF’s findings, there were two main causes faults in the electrical components, and overheating of the engines. Regular maintenance could reduce the risk of such fires occurring.Hence, LTA requires older vehicles and vehicles that are heavily used to be inspected more frequently. LTA is also working with SCDF to remind vehicle owners on regular maintenance and against illegal modification of their vehicles as this could compromise the safety features of their vehicles and trigger vehicle fires."
incentives for extension of employment contracts to elderly workers,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether the Ministry is aware that some companies are unwilling to extend the contracts of healthy elderly workers to 67 years old; (b) what is the Ministry doing to incentivise hiring of elderly workers; and (c) how many workers aged 60 years and above are actively looking for jobs.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: Under the Retirement and Re-employment Act (RRA), employers are required to offer eligible employees re-employment till age 67. Since re-employment was introduced in 2012, over 98% of private-sector local employees who wished to continue working at age 62 were offered re-employment. The number of disputes related to re-employment has remained low for the past five years, at about 40 each year. Most cases were resolved through mediation, with less than four cases on average each year which proceeded to adjudication. These cases contain a mix of situations where the dispute arose due to a misunderstanding of the law by the employer, or by the employee.MOM has in place a number of measures to increase the employability of older workers and encourage employers to hire older workers. The Special Employment Credit (SEC) scheme provides a wage offset of up to 8% of monthly wages to employers when they hire older workers. An additional wage offset of up to 3% of monthly wages is also provided to encourage continued employment of older workers aged 65 and above. Reduced employer CPF contribution rates for employees aged 55 and above further help to moderate the costs of hiring older workers for employers. Under the WorkPro scheme, employers can receive government funding support of up to $320,000 per company to implement age management practices and redesign workplaces and processes to create easier, safer and smarter jobs for older workers.As mindset change is also needed to improve the employability of older workers, TAFEP runs campaigns to raise awareness of the value that older workers bring to the workforce and encourage employers to tap on their skills and experience.In June 2017, unemployment rate of older residents aged 60 and over in the labour force remained low at 3.3%. MOM actively supports them through the Adapt and Grow Initiative. This includes Career Matching services, as well as programmes to help workers overcome wage and skill mismatches. In particular, the Career Support Programme encourages employers to hire experienced, mature PMETs, especially the long-term unemployed, by providing them with salary support. Mature PMETs can tap on the higher wage and training support under the Professional Conversion Programmes to reskill, so that they can move into new occupations and sectors with good prospects and progression. Mature rank-and-file workers can also tap on wage and training support under Work Trial and other Place-and-Train/Train-and-Place programmes offered by WSG and NTUC-e2i.Our various programmes to improve the employability of older workers have been showing encouraging results. The employment rate of residents aged 55-64 has increased from 61.2% in 2011 to 67.3% in 2016. This compares favourably with developed economies, with Singapore ranked 9th against 35 OECD countries in 2016. We will continue to work with Tripartite partners to improve opportunities for older Singaporeans who are fit and ready to find employment."
offences and accidents involving e-scooters,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the number of offences involving e-scooters and the offender profile over the past three years; (b) what is the number of accidents involving e-scooter users over the past three years; (c) what plans does the Ministry have to reduce the risks posed by e-scooters particularly on the roads; and (d) whether the Ministry will consider making it mandatory for e-scooter users to wear a helmet.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: From January to September 2017, there were about 110 accidents involving personal mobility devices (PMDs) such as e-scooters. These accidents occurred on public paths, or at road junctions when PMD riders were crossing the road, or on roads when PMD riders were riding parallel to vehicle traffic illegally. Over the same period, LTA and the Traffic Police issued warnings or summonses to about 330 riders for the offence of riding PMDs on roads. (We do not have comprehensive figures for accidents involving PMDs prior to 2017.)LTA has increased its outreach efforts to raise awareness of the danger of riding PMDs on roads. These include installing more than 500 signages at hotspots to warn PMD riders to stay off the roads.LTA will also be strengthening its penalty regime to deter riding of PMDs on roads. With effect from 15 January 2018, the current composition sum of $100 will be increased to $300 and $500 for offenders who ride on local and major roads respectively. Offenders who ride on the expressways will be charged in court. Repeat offenders will face stiffer penalties, including court action. If convicted, offenders face a fine of up to $2,000 or imprisonment of up to three months, or both.As PMD riders are not allowed on roads, and have to abide by speed limits of 15km/h on footpaths and 25 km/h on shared and cycling paths, we do not require them to wear helmets. However, we encourage PMD riders to take personal responsibility and use the necessary protective gear while riding. LTA will be launching the Safe Riding Programme (SRP) soon in schools, foreign worker dormitories and community centres. It will be compulsory for all cyclists and PMD users who are caught riding recklessly to attend the SRP."
"registration of e-bikes and personal mobility devices and stringent guidelines on their quality, safety and usage",Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the number of e-bikes that have been registered thus far; (b) what can motorists do when they see e-bikes flouting the rules on the streets; and (c) whether more stringent guidelines on the quality and safety of e-bikes and PMDs will be imposed in light of PMDs having caused home fires due to overcharging.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: As of end-December 2017, more than 12,600 power-assisted bicycles (PABs) have been registered. Owners of PABs have until 31 January 2018 to register their PABs and affix it with a number plate.Motorists or members of the public can report errant PAB riders to the Traffic Police or LTA. Details such as the date, time, location, PAB registration number, description of the rider, and video or photo evidence of the offence, will aid the investigation.Since February 2016, only PABs that meet the EN15194 standard will be approved by LTA. This is a rigorous standard that has also been adopted by Australia and many European countries, requiring stringent tests on the mechanical strength of batteries as well as the risks of short circuits and overcharging.The power adaptors used to charge personal mobility devices (PMDs) must also comply with the Consumer Protection (Safety Requirements) Regulations administered by SPRING. The adaptors must be type-tested and certified compliant with the relevant safety standards, registered with SPRING, and carry the SAFETY Mark before they can be sold in Singapore. In view of the recent spates of fire involving PMDs, LTA and SPRING are assessing if additional product safety requirements are needed."
workforce singapore's job matching success rate,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how many applications for job matching have been received by Workforce Singapore (WSG) since its inception; (b) how many applicants have been successfully matched with jobs; and (c) what is WSG doing to improve its job-matching success rate.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: In the 12 months since the inception of WSG (i.e. 4Q 2016 – 3Q 2017), more than 23,000 jobseekers registered at WSG’s and NTUC-e2i's career centres for career matching services, and about 14,000 jobseekers were placed through these services. In addition, about a further 10,000 were placed through other Adapt and Grow programmes to address wage and skills mismatches. Of all the jobseekers placed, more than half were professionals, managers, executives and technicians, more than half were aged 40 and above, and about a third were long term unemployed (LTU).Since July 2017, WSG's career centres have been remodelled and rebranded as Careers Connect with an expanded suite of customised career matching services. Jobseekers who require more in-depth support, can undergo tailored career management and counselling programmes and receive dedicated one-to-one career coaching suited to their needs.We had also enhanced our programmes under the Adapt and Grow initiative in 2017, such as the Professional Conversion Programmes (PCP) and the Career Support Programme (CSP), to provide more training and wage support to jobseekers (especially the mature and LTU) and employers to help overcome mismatches arising from skills or wage expectation gaps."
average savings rate per income group in last 10 years,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Trade) what has been the average savings rate for each income group in Singapore in the last 10 years.,"Mr Lim Hng Kiang: Data on household and individual savings rates by income groups are not available.However, data on the aggregate level of household financial assets can be obtained from the Household Sector balance sheet compiled by the Department of Statistics. These financial assets comprise (i) currency and deposits, (ii) shares and securities, (iii) life insurance attributable to households as policyholders, (iv) Central Provident Fund (CPF) balances, and (v) pension funds.Over the last 10 years, households' financial assets have increased steadily from $584.3 billion as at the end of December 2007 to $1,126.1 billion as at the end of September 2017."
number of permanent residents taking up singapore citizenship,"Mr Pritam Singh asked the Prime Minister (a) how does the Ministry persuade permanent residents (PR) to take up Singapore citizenship; (b) how many PRs have held on to their PR status for more than 10, 15, 20 and 25 years respectively and by nationality; and (c) what are the common reasons cited by these individuals for not taking up Singapore citizenship.","Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): About 15% of Permanent Residents (PRs) have been PRs for 20 or more years. The majority of such PRs originate from Southeast Asian countries.Taking up citizenship is a serious commitment which is ultimately a personal decision. The vast majority of adult new citizens who have made this commitment to become citizens, have lived here for some time, or have family ties to Singaporeans, such as spouses.PRs contribute to Singapore in many different ways, and add to our strengths as a society and economy.The best way to encourage qualified PRs who have decided to make their future here to consider applying for citizenship is to continue to ensure that our Singapore citizens are well looked after, in a Singapore that continues to do well. To reflect the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship, and to acknowledge Singapore citizens' commitment to Singapore, citizens receive more support and benefits than PRs in several areas, such as parenthood, housing, healthcare, and education.In recent years, we have widened the differentiation in benefits accorded to Singapore Citizens and PRs.It is also important that we continue to be an inclusive society that is open and gracious. How welcoming and accepting we are of newcomers will also impact on their decision to sink roots here permanently."
civil service's criteria in evaluating older applicants with o and a-level results for vocational and skills-based jobs,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Prime Minister how and to what extent are O and A Level results considered in evaluating applications from older applicants for vocational and skills-based jobs in the Civil Service.,"Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): The Civil Service recruits based on whether the applicant has the skills required for the job. Educational qualifications are useful as a proxy for skills when assessing applicants with no prior work experience. For mid-career and older applicants, relevant work experience and demonstrated skills are used to determine their suitability for the job, more so than their academic qualifications."
restrictions for users of e-bikes and personal mobility devices within designated silver zones,"Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for Transport whether LTA can consider applying restrictions such as ""dismount and walk"" for users of e-bikes and personal mobility devices when they travel within designated Silver Zones.",Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The Active Mobility Code of Conduct issued by the Active Mobility Advisory Panel (AMAP) in March 2016 stipulates that cyclists and users of e-bikes and personal mobility devices should dismount and push their devices at areas with high pedestrian traffic. This applies to all public paths regardless of whether they are within or outside Silver Zones. The AMAP will be considering further refinements to the active mobility rules in 2018.
update on investigation into tpe-pie viaduct collapse in july 2017,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the investigation into the collapse of the partially constructed viaduct structure linking PIE and TPE at Upper Changi Road East in July 2017 has been completed; and (b) if so, when will the report be released publicly.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Investigations are still ongoing. After investigations are completed, the matter will be referred to the Attorney-General's Chambers for their assessment. More information will be provided at the appropriate juncture."
juveniles admitted into places of safety under children and young persons act,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) in each of the past three years, how many juveniles have been referred by the Ministry or ordered by the courts to be admitted into places of safety as defined in the Children and Young Persons Act respectively; and (b) how many of such juveniles admitted into these places of safety have at least one parent who is incarcerated or has been incarcerated before.","Mr Desmond Lee: Children and young persons (CYPs) who are in need of care and protection, such as those who have been abused or neglected, may be referred by MSF or ordered by the Youth Court to reside in a place of safety, such as a licensed CYP Home.The number of such CYPs admitted to all licensed CYP Homes in the past three years is in Table 1.About one-quarter of CYPs known to MSF due to child abuse and neglect have a caregiver who had previously been arrested or incarcerated."
reasons for increase in households receiving short- and medium-term assistance and long-term assistance from fy2012 to fy2016,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what are the most common reasons for the increase in households receiving SMTA (short- and medium-term assistance) and LTA (long-term assistance) from FY2012 to FY2016; (b) what conclusions can be derived from these; and (c) how will the Ministry strategise moving into the future.,"Mr Desmond Lee: The number of households assisted each year on either ComCare Short-to-Medium-Term Assistance (SMTA) or Long-Term Assistance (LTA) has generally increased over the past five years, with a slight decrease for those assisted on SMTA in FY2016 compared to FY2015.This could be due to several factors, such as the widening of the ComCare eligibility criteria in 2012 and 2014, greater awareness and accessibility to social assistance through the network of 24 Social Service Offices which was rolled out between 2013 and 2015, and demographic changes.The proportion of older SMTA main applicants (aged 55 to 64) increased from 18% in FY2012 to 23% in FY2016. The proportion of those who were not working also increased from 48% in FY2012 to 53% in FY2016. Most of those who were not working were either medically unfit to work, or retired. The increase in proportion of SMTA main applicants who are older, medically unfit to work or retired corresponds with demographic trends such as shrinking family sizes and an ageing population.The Government will continue to provide multiple layers of assistance for the lower-income and vulnerable through a network of government agencies and community groups. There are many schemes in place addressing specific needs across various domains such as financial needs, healthcare, housing, education, employment and retirement adequacy. Together, these schemes provide substantial support to those in need.We will continue to refine and enhance our policies and approach to social service delivery, so that the low-income and vulnerable will get the support they require to cover their basic needs. But even as the Government does more, we must be careful not to erode the strong work ethic and sense of individual responsibility and self-reliance, which have been key factors underpinning Singapore's growth as a society and nation. We must also be careful not to diminish the role of the family and the community, where they are able to provide or contribute to the care and support for individuals who are disadvantaged or vulnerable.Today, there are many ground-up initiatives in the community, and many citizens are already giving and contributing. For example, there are community groups who reach out, befriend and support various vulnerable groups such as low-income families with children and the elderly who live alone. The Government will continue to engage and partner the community to support such vulnerable groups. Through the SG Cares movement, we hope to mobilise volunteers and bring partners with different skills and resources to work with us in caring for those in need.The Government also looks continually at how we can enhance client-centricity in service delivery. There are ongoing efforts to tighten inter-agency referral processes and facilitate data-sharing with other agencies. We are also exploring the potential for more integrated service delivery and co-location of complementary services so that our clients can access more holistic assistance and become self-reliant again."
teaching of curriculum open-access resources in economics at post-secondary level,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Education (Schools) whether the Ministry has introduced elements of the Curriculum Open-access Resources in Economics (CORE), which aims to teach economics in a way that is more applicable to real world situations, at the post-secondary level and, if not, whether it will consider doing so.","Mr Ng Chee Meng: It is indeed important for all subjects, including Economics, to be taught in a way that is applicable to real-world situations. Our curriculum is designed to do so.The ‘A’ level Economics curriculum is designed to provide students opportunities to apply Economics concepts, principles and theories to real-world contexts. Through the use of real-world examples and authentic case studies, students are engaged in class discussions that enable them to analyse how economic decisions are made, consider multiple perspectives in decision-making and recognise consequences arising from decisions made. For example, students discuss the thinking behind the Singapore Budget, and the possible impact of the budget on individuals, firms and the economy.The Singapore Student Learning Space, which is the MOE online learning platform that is being developed, includes case studies and resources that reflect real-world contexts. For example, Economics lesson packages on how pricing of goods and services such as sugary beverages and private-hire rides influence consumer behaviour and expenditure are available on this learning platform.Where appropriate, Curriculum Open-access Resources in Economics (CORE) can serve as a supplementary resource for incorporation in the Singapore Student Learning Space."
enforcement action taken by volunteers exercising new enforcement powers conferred by nea (miscellaneous amendments) act,Mr Chen Show Mao asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources what is the total number of cases of enforcement action taken by the NEA that involved volunteers exercising their new enforcement powers conferred by the NEA (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act of 2016.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The primary role of a Community Volunteer (CV) is to educate environmental offenders to stop the offending acts and encourage greater ownership of the environment.To enable the CVs to perform their role more effectively, they are empowered to request the particulars of offenders who fail to heed their advice. The particulars are sent to the National Environment Agency (NEA) for follow-up action. Since 2016, our CVs have engaged more than 3,500 individuals for environmental offences such as littering in public spaces and smoking in prohibited areas. The vast majority responded positively such as by picking up their litter and hence no further action was taken. A small number of around 60 individuals were non-compliant and therefore subjected to enforcement action by NEA such as summonses and advisory letters."
graduates of biotechnology-related courses from institutes of higher learning and other institutions,"Mr Chen Show Mao asked the Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (a) in each year over the past five years, what is the number of graduates of biotechnology-related courses from our universities, polytechnics, ITEs and other institutions; (b) what is the employment rate of these graduates within 6 and 12 months of graduation respectively; (c) of these graduates, how many found work in the public and private sectors respectively; and (d) what is the Ministry's forecast of future job growth in the biotechnology industry in Singapore.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: Over the past five years, around 3,000 students graduate annually from biotechnology-related courses from our Autonomous Universities (AU), polytechnics and ITE. Many will choose to further their studies. As for those who entered the labour force, around 85% found employment within six months after completing their final examinations, with the majority of them in the private sector.Our Institutes of Higher Learning will continue to work with the industry to ensure that the courses are relevant to its needs, and that intake into these programmes is sized appropriately."
further measures to reduce noise and nuisance from birds roosting in trees along upper serangoon road near sennett residences,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for National Development what are the further measures besides the regular pruning of the trees that AVA can take to reduce the noise and nuisance caused by a large population of birds roosting in the trees along Upper Serangoon Road near Sennett Residences.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: AVA adopts a multi-pronged approach to address noise and nuisance caused by birds roosting in trees. For the case along Upper Serangoon Road, AVA has taken several steps. First, as mentioned by Mr Sitoh, AVA has worked with NParks to prune the trees to discourage birds from roosting in them. Second, AVA conducted a trial in September, using lasers to disperse the birds. AVA is currently assessing the effectiveness of this measure. Third, AVA will continue to work with NEA and the Potong Pasir Town Council to ensure that food waste is properly disposed of. This will reduce food sources for birds and discourage them from roosting nearby. Fourth, AVA will also work with NEA and the Town Council to educate residents not to feed the birds."
first-timer buyers of bto flats in mature estates,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the average percentage of buyers of BTO flats in mature estates who are first-timers; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider extending the Special Housing Grant (SHG) to first-timer buyers with parents who live within 2km of BTO flats in mature estates.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB sets aside a large proportion of the new public flat supply for first-timer families. On average, about 8 in 10 buyers of BTO flats in the mature estates are first-timers.The Special CPF Housing Grant (SHG) is intended to help lower- to middle-income households own their first home. To encourage financial prudence, the SHG is limited to the purchase of new 4-room and smaller HDB flats in the non-mature estates. There are currently no plans to extend the SHG to the purchase of flats in the mature estates. Eligible first-timer households can continue to enjoy up to $40,000 in the Additional CPF Housing Grant (AHG) when they purchase a flat in the mature estates."
number of persons pledging to donate whole bodies to medical research after death,Mr Seah Kian Peng asked the Minister for Health how many persons have pledged to donate their whole bodies to medical research after death in the last three years.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Under the Medical (Therapy, Education and Research) Act, anyone from 18 years of age and who is not mentally disordered can pledge to donate their whole body upon death, to be used for research, transplant or education purposes.In the last three years, the numbers of new pledges for whole body donation after death to be used for medical research are as follows:"
traffic police's strategies to raise awareness of road safety and reduce accidents,"Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what are the Traffic Police's strategies to raise greater awareness of road safety and reduce traffic accidents among both road users and the public; and (b) whether there are plans to review and update the Highway Code and curriculum in driving centres, given the change in road traffic landscape such as the increase in personal mobility devices on the roads.","Mr K Shanmugam: Raising awareness is one of Traffic Police's (TP) key strategies to enhance road safety.TP introduced the ""Use Your Road Sense"" movement in 2015, to actively reach out to road users. The objective is to influence and shape the right behaviour for better road safety. The outreach targeted not only general road users, but also vulnerable groups such as motorcyclists and elderly pedestrians, and vocational drivers such as taxi and heavy vehicle drivers.TP is also working with LTA to raise awareness concerning the dangers of riding personal mobility devices (PMDs) on the roads. Among others, signs have been installed at hotspots to warn PMD riders to stay off the roads. PMD riders are also reminded of the rules and code of conduct for cycling and the use of PMDs through campaigns and programmes (e.g. Safe Riders Campaign and Safe Cycling Programme), including the safe use of pedestrian crossings (e.g. stopping and looking out for traffic before crossing).The basic driving and riding curricula at the driving schools have been and will continue to be regularly updated to remain relevant as the traffic landscape changes. TP is also leveraging new technology, for example, it will mandate driving and riding simulation training for all learner motorists in 2019. This will enable them to acquire the necessary skills and know-how to react properly in common traffic situations within a safe, controlled environment.To promote continual learning for motorists, TP launched the one-stop Online Learning Portal in July 2017, which allows free public access to the latest driving theory handbooks. The portal will be further enhanced later this year to include animated videos of the top causes of accidents, mock theory tests, and updates on road traffic regulations.In addition, the Safe Driving Course (SDC) was introduced in November 2015, to impart safe driving techniques to motorists who have accumulated a high number of demerit points.TP is also updating the Highway Code to ensure its continued relevance in today’s landscape. The online basic and final theory handbooks will also be periodically reviewed and updated so that the latest information on traffic signs, rules and regulations are made available to the public."
appointment of foreign job placement agencies by workforce singapore,Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the rationale for Workforce Singapore to appoint foreign job placement agencies instead of local agencies with an established presence in Singapore to help local PMETs find jobs; (b) what is the projected number of job placements to be found through the two agencies at the end of the two-year pilot scheme; and (c) what is the projected cost of outsourcing job placements to the two foreign agencies over the pilot phase.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: To keep strengthening employment support for our local jobseekers, Workforce Singapore (WSG) adopts a multi-provider approach to help them. It runs three career centres, complemented by two more centres operated by NTUC-e2i. In addition, WSG and its predecessor, Workforce Development Agency (WDA), had tapped on private sector employment agencies to provide wider employment outreach for our jobseekers.As unemployment has generally been low, placements done by most employment agencies here have involved mainly passive jobseekers, i.e. persons already in employment who may not be actively searching for jobs. To step up our support for active jobseekers who are unemployed and actively looking for jobs, we did a global search of employment agencies with the business model, experience and expertise suited to help such active jobseekers. We found that partnerships between government and the private sector have been successful in countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia, where private placement providers are contracted to place active jobseekers, including those who may face greater employment barriers. Hence, WSG appointed two of them as our partners so that we can adapt some of their best practices in Singapore for the benefit of our active jobseekers.The two placement providers in the current pilot commenced operations six and eight months ago. Currently, they are still ramping up their operations and have yet to reach steady state. The payment they will receive from WSG will mainly depend on how many jobseekers they are able to place, taking into account the profile of the jobseekers including age and length of unemployment."
timeline and plan for launching of gpfirst scheme nationally,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Health what is the timeline and plan for the launching of the GPFirst Scheme nationally and what is the projected annual cost of the scheme to the Government and the average benefit to be gained by beneficiaries after the cost of consulting a GP is factored in.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The GPFirst programme is a pilot scheme first introduced at Changi General Hospital (CGH) in January 2014. GPFirst aims to encourage patients with non-emergency conditions to seek treatment at General Practitioners (GPs) rather than at the Emergency Department (ED). Patients assessed by the participating GPs as requiring ED care are referred to the ED with minimal delay. In recognition that the patient has incurred initial charges at the GP, a $50 subsidy is provided to offset the patient’s ED bill.In 2016, about $1 million was invested in the GPFirst programme at CGH which would include the ED subsidy, expenses on GP engagement initiatives and publicity to raise the awareness of the programme. The programme not only helps to reduce non-emergency cases seen in CGH’s ED, thereby saving unnecessary ED expenses by the hospital and the patients, more importantly, it also enables the ED to focus on attending to patients with critical conditions in a timelier manner. Patients with non-emergency conditions will also benefit from more timely access to care at the GPsand cost savings as the GP charge would typically be less than $50, as compared to $120 if he visits the CGH ED.From CGH's pilot, MOH has concluded that the benefits justify the cost of running the GPFirst scheme. The scheme will be extended to more public hospitals in 2018. This will entail establishing close partnerships with GPs, promoting awareness among residents and learning from CGH's pilot."
issues and challenges faced in implementation of medishield life,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked the Minister for Health (a) what have been the issues and challenges faced in the implementation of Medishield Life; (b) what has been the compliance rate; and (c) whether there has been any case where action had to be taken.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: MediShield Life was introduced in November 2015 as a universal healthcare insurance scheme that provides all Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents with lifelong coverage against large healthcare bills.MediShield Life has been successfully implemented. Since its launch, around 300,000 Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents have made successful claims, including around 40,000 who were previously uninsured. Overall claims increased from $758 million in 2016 to $845 million in 2017.To promote better understanding of MediShield Life and its features, roadshows were conducted in partnership with the media and community organisations. These include media advertisements and targeted outreach to seniors through the Pioneer Generation Office and Grassroots Organisations. These efforts have helped to raise public awareness and appreciation for MediShield Life.With Government subsidies and financial assistance from Additional Premium Support, we have achieved a very high compliance rate for payment of MediShield Life premiums. As at end October 2017, about 1% of Singapore Residents have not fully paid their premiums. MOH will continue to work with MSF and CPF Board to follow up with these individuals, and provide assistance to low-income Singaporeans. No one will lose their MediShield Life coverage due to genuine financial difficulties in paying for the premiums."
number of neighbourly disputes referred to imh by police and other agencies,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Health how many cases have been referred to the Institute of Mental Health by the police or other agencies arising from neighbourly disputes each year in the last three years and what help can residents turn to when encountering neighbours with suspected mental health conditions.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Institute of Mental Health (IMH) does not maintain data on the number of cases suspected of mental health conditions, who were referred by the police or other agencies arising from neighbourly disputes. However, the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) has been receiving referrals for mental health assessments arising from neighbourly disputes. Between 2015 and 2017, 31 referrals were received by AIC, of whom eight had active mental health symptoms and were referred to IMH for treatment.In the community, residents who observe persons who display disturbing behaviours can contact AIC at careinmind@aic.sg for assistance and referral. If they encounter persons in crisis, residents can contact the IMH Mental Health 24-hour Helpline at 6389 2222, which is manned by counsellors who are trained to assess and triage cases, and activate home visit teams quickly if necessary.In cases where a person is behaving in a manner that is dangerous to self or others, members of the public should call ‘999’ for urgent police assistance."
total amount of medisave contributions belonging to pensioners under their respective pension schemes,"Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the total amount of Medisave contributions residing under each group of pensioners under the Fixed Amount on Ward (FAW), Co-payment on Ward (CPW), Comprehensive Co-payment Scheme (CCS) and Medisave-cum-Subsidised Outpatient (MSO) schemes respectively; and (b) what the number of Medisave transactions registered in the past 12 months for each of the above pension schemes.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Government pensioners receive one of the four Post-Retirement Medical Benefits: Fixed Amount on Ward (FAW), Co-payment on Ward (CPW), Comprehensive Co-payment Scheme (CCS) and Medisave-cum-Subsidised Outpatient (MSO) scheme.FAW pensioners are entitled to comprehensive medical benefits at government healthcare institutions, and hence not required to set aside any Medisave. CPW pensioners only need to set aside 30% of their cohort’s applicable Basic Healthcare Sum (BHS). The average Medisave balance of CPW pensioners is $15,700. CCS and MSO pensioners are subject to their cohort's applicable BHS. The average Medisave balances are $47,400 and $43,300 for each pensioner under the CCS and MSO schemes respectively.On average, CPW, CCS and MSO pensioners made 1, 2 and 3 transactions per person respectively in 2016."
"applications for citizenship, permanent residence and long-term visit passes by foreign spouses of singaporeans","Mr Zaqy Mohamad asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) in each of the last five years, how many foreign spouses of Singaporeans have applied for citizenship, permanent residence and long-term visit passes respectively; (b) what is the success rate; and (c) what proportion of these applicants for permanent residence and citizenship who have Singaporean spouses or children were not successful.","Mr K Shanmugam: From 2012 to 2016, the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority received an annual average of about 6,600 Singapore Citizenship (SC), 8,700 Permanent Residence (PR) and 16,600 Long-Term Visit Pass (LTVP) applications from foreign spouses of Singaporeans. Over the same period, an annual average of 4,500, 4,300 and 13,900 foreign spouses of Singaporeans were granted SC, PR and LTVP respectively. The corresponding success rates were around 68%, 49% and 84%.ICA is unable to break down the data by whether these individuals had any Singapore Citizen children."
total value of online sales transactions in singapore and gst revenue lost,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Finance what is the total value of online sales transactions for each of the past five years in Singapore and what is the amount of payable GST revenue that is lost in such transactions.,"Mr Heng Swee Keat: Currently, there is no ready mechanism to differentiate and track GST that is currently collected versus GST not applicable for online transactions.As shared in Budget 2017, with increasing digital transactions and cross-border trade, some countries have taken steps to adjust their GST system, to ensure a level-playing field between their local businesses which are GST-registered, and foreign-based ones which are not. We are studying how we can do likewise."
enforcement action taken by volunteers exercising new enforcement powers conferred by nea (miscellaneous amendments) act,Mr Chen Show Mao asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources what is the total number of cases of enforcement action taken by the NEA that involved volunteers exercising their new enforcement powers conferred by the NEA (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act of 2016.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The primary role of a Community Volunteer (CV) is to educate environmental offenders to stop the offending acts and encourage greater ownership of the environment.To enable the CVs to perform their role more effectively, they are empowered to request the particulars of offenders who fail to heed their advice.

development of aviation industry from sia-boeing deal,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) regarding the $18.7 billion SIA-Boeing deal that was recently announced (a) whether there will be economic activities to be undertaken in Singapore that can support the development of our aviation industry as a result of this transaction; and (b) whether economic activities such as the manufacturing of parts of the aircraft being ordered or provision of related services were negotiated as a condition of the transaction.,"Mr S Iswaran: SIA's recent order of Boeing planes was a commercial deal negotiated between SIA and Boeing. While the Singapore Government was not involved in the deal, the deal could lead to economic spin-offs for Singapore, through new business opportunities for Boeing's aftermarket services and new maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) activities.First, the new aircraft will provide new opportunities for SIA to expand its network while supporting fleet modernisation.Second, Boeing has a substantial aftermarket services presence in Singapore today, covering activities such as pilot training, flight services, fleet management, and digital aviation services, which could support SIA's expanded Boeing fleet.Third, SIA Engineering Company (SIAEC) and GE Aviation have announced an agreement to establish a proposed joint venture (JV) in Singapore, which will provide engine MRO services for GE90 engines, as well as GE9X engines powering SIA's new fleet of Boeing 777X aircraft.The Government has been supporting capability building efforts across the diverse segments of our Aerospace industry, including engine overhaul MRO and airframe MRO. To this end, we are currently developing the Aerospace Industry Transformation Map (ITM), which will lay out comprehensive strategies to ensure that we are well-positioned to capture the growth opportunities in the Aerospace industry."
safeguarding interests of children and employees in pre-school centres against insolvency,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Social and Family Development what safeguards are in place to protect the interests of children enrolled in pre-school programmes as well as employees of pre-school centres in the event that such centres become insolvent and cease operations.,"Mr Desmond Lee: The focus of the Government's regulations for preschools is to ensure the safety, well-being and development of our young children enrolled in these preschools. Where operations are deemed to be affected and risk the safety and well-being of children, the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) will intervene decisively, and involve other government agencies to investigate more complex cases. In the event of unforeseen centre closures, ECDA will assist parents with alternative placement for their children. For teachers, it is an offence for employers not to pay salaries and Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions. The Ministry of Manpower and CPF Board will investigate such cases."
announcements on peak-hour mrt delays,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the peak hour MRT delays experienced on 24 October 2017 were announced to commuters through all the usual channels and, if not, what was the reason; and (b) whether the delay had exceeded the 10-minute delay threshold beyond which such announcements are mandatory.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: On 24 October 2017, SMRT operated the East West Line (EWL) train services at slower speeds due to a signalling fault. SMRT informed commuters through the usual channels, including regular station and train announcements."
update on industry transformation maps and global innovation alliance,Ms Sun Xueling asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) whether he can provide a progress update on the Industry Transformation Maps and the Global Innovation Alliance.,"Mr S Iswaran: The Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) and Global Innovation Alliance (GIA) were two key initiatives proposed by the Committee on the Future Economy. We are making good progress on both of these.Through the ITMs, lead agencies and their partners are putting in place industry-specific transformation strategies for 23 industries that make up 80% of our economy. 13 ITMs have been launched so far, and the remainder will be rolled out by the end of this financial year. Each ITM consists of a growth and competitiveness plan, supported by four pillars – productivity, jobs and skills, innovation, and trade and internationalisation. Each ITM also addresses the Government’s role in enabling industry upgrading, for example, through conducive regulations. Alongside the ITMs, we have also launched Skills Frameworks to support the jobs and skills pillar, which provide information on career pathways, job roles, skills needs, and relevant training programmes.Implementation of the strategies and plans in the ITMs has started. For example, as part of the Precision Engineering ITM, A*STAR's Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology (SIMTech) recently launched a model factory, which allows SMEs to experience and experiment with advanced manufacturing technologies in a real-life production environment. Leveraging on their collaboration with SIMTech, SMEs such as JEP Aerospace and Feinmetall have started the digital transformation journey in their own factories.Another recently launched example is the 'hive' trade facilitation platform developed by Singapore Logistics Association to build trade connectivity, as part of the Wholesale Trade ITM. It enables businesses to quickly and efficiently meet cross-border trade compliance requirements for more than 50 Customs authorities worldwide, increasing productivity.The objective of the GIA is to establish networks to create more opportunities for Singaporean students, entrepreneurs and business owners to gain overseas experience, connect and collaborate with overseas partners. Since the announcement in Budget 2017, EDB has set up the GIA Programme Office (GIA PO) to coordinate the initiative. EDB, IE Singapore, SPRING and MOE have been engaging various in-market Operating Partners to set up GIA networks in the four focus cities under GIA Phase 1 (San Francisco, Beijing, Jakarta, Bangkok).For instance, building on the successful establishment of BLOCK71 in San Francisco, we launched ""BLOCK71 Jakarta"" in July this year, to provide a co-working space that aims to catalyse mutually beneficial partnerships between Indonesian and Singaporean start-ups. For Bangkok and Beijing, IE Singapore has signed memoranda of understanding (MOUs) with tech partners to help Singapore start-ups better understand these markets, test-bed their products, and work with overseas players to implement solutions. For access to Thailand, this includes partnerships with tech community builders C asean and Hubba; for access to China, this includes partnerships with startup accelerator AIRMaker, NTUitive (the innovation and enterprise arm of Nanyang Technological University) and Chinese media platform 36Kr.We will continue to work with suitable partners and strengthen our GIA networks.Initiatives like the ITMs and the GIA will support our growth and transformation efforts, and position Singapore well for the future."
state of mental health in singapore,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the state of mental health in Singapore; and (b) whether the Ministry will conduct a comprehensive national study of the state of mental health encompassing the study of mental illnesses and the study of the social perception, stigmatisation and consequences of mental illness.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: In 2010, the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) conducted the first Singapore Mental Health Study which concluded that 9.3% of Singapore Residents would have at least one mood5 or anxiety disorder at some point of their adult lifetime. Among the illnesses assessed, Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) were the most common mental health conditions in Singapore. MDD affected one in 17 Singapore Residents and OCD affected one in 33 Singapore Residents at some point in their lifetimes. The second Singapore Mental Health Study is currently underway. It will inform us how the mental health landscape has changed in the years since the first study and provide insights into other conditions such as schizophrenia and sleep disorders.In addition, IMH has also conducted the Mental Health Literacy Study, which was completed in 2016. The study focused on social perceptions and stigmatisation of mental illness. The study suggested considerable stigma towards individuals with mental health conditions, which could hinder such individuals from seeking treatment.Government agencies, healthcare providers and community partners have been working together on efforts to reduce the stigma of mental health conditions and encourage help-seeking. For example, the National Council of Social Services (NCSS) is embarking on a multi-year public education campaign to promote a more inclusive society for persons with mental health conditions. The enhanced Community Mental Health Masterplan announced in 2017 is being implemented to strengthen community-based care for persons with mental health conditions. These included initiatives to better outreach to individuals suffering from mental health conditions for early treatment, and enhancement of mental health services in the primary care sector."
stricter safety regulations for high-risk sports,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) whether mixed martial arts can be subjected to stricter safety regulations; and (b) whether it can be made mandatory for public sports events, particularly those of high-risk sports, to come under the purview of Sport Singapore.","Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: For the vast majority of sports, the respective International Federations and National Sports Associations in Singapore determine the rules and safety protocols to ensure the safety of participants in training and during competitions. Event organisers who conduct competitions under the ambit of these sport governing bodies can be held to account for neglecting safety measures.However, mixed martial arts contests tend to be organised as part of commercial entertainment events owned by private promoters, where the sanction that the sports governing bodies can effectively bring to bear is curtailed.To guide sports stakeholders on safety, the Sports Safety Committee established by Sport Singapore (SportSG) periodically reviews and publishes the Overview and Recommendations for Sports Safety in Singapore, with the aim of establishing a comprehensive approach to minimising sports safety incidents, in line with international best practices. The last review was completed in 2015.The Committee recommended that sports event organisers safeguard the well-being of their participants by minimally implementing a comprehensive risk management plan, conducting pre-event evaluation for participants, and deploying properly-trained medical personnel. Organisers of events deemed to be high-risk are advised to standby additional medical resources. Participants also need to exercise personal responsibility by taking safety precautions, being well prepared when participating in sports activities, and refrain from participating if they feel unwell on the day of an event.SportSG will continue to work with sports stakeholders to strengthen public education and raise awareness of the importance of safety at sports events to make sports safer for all."
measures to mitigate encounters with wild boars,Ms Sun Xueling asked the Minister for National Development whether AVA will be implementing measures to mitigate encounters with wild boars and ensure public safety in Pasir Ris Punggol where wild boars have been sighted in the past.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Government agencies have been working closely with stakeholders including ACRES, NUS, Wildlife Reserves Singapore, and nature groups on several fronts.First, we will continue to monitor and manage the wild boar populations in their natural habitats. There are not that many wild boars in our nature reserves. But we have identified a few hotspots where the numbers are higher due to the availability of food. Agencies have been removing oil palms at these hotspots as palm fruit is a favoured food source of the boars. In areas where human feeding occurs, like Pasir Ris-Punggol, enforcement action will be taken. It is important for the public to stop this feeding because this changes the natural behaviour of the boars. Low railings will also be installed in places where these hotspots abut roads to discourage the boars from wandering beyond forested areas.Second, we will manage the movement of wild boars when forested State land is cleared for development. NParks will continue to advise agencies and developers to shepherd wild boars towards other contiguous forested sites and to hoard up areas that are near residential estates and roads. This will reduce the probability of wild boars escaping into public residential areas.In addition, we will step up public education efforts on human-wildlife encounters. AVA and NParks are working on materials to educate residents on what to do when they encounter wild boars or other animals.We will continue to work with stakeholders in residential areas to manage the wild boar issues and ensure public safety."
participating companies and employees in national steps challenge,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Health (a) how many companies and employees have participated in the previous seasons of the National Steps Challenge; (b) what is the number of companies and employees targeted for the Corporate Challenge of this season's National Steps Challenge; (c) what measures are in place to promote the Corporate Challenge among companies based in Singapore; and (d) whether and how such measures are evaluated for their effectiveness.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: To encourage working adults to participate in the National Steps ChallengeTM, the Health Promotion Board (HPB) introduced a Corporate Challenge in Season 2 which lasted from 14 November 2016 to 28 February 2017. Over 65,000 employees from 260 organisations participated in the Corporate Challenge.The National Steps ChallengeTM has successfully motivated more Singaporeans to become more active. When individuals took part in the Corporate Challenge, we found that participants walked an additional 1,500 steps per day on average. Interviews with participants indicated that peer influence and organisational support were instrumental in motivating them to walk more. A competitive team element also spurred participants to improve and sustain their efforts.The upcoming season of the Corporate Challenge will take place from 1 December 2017 to 31 March 2018. HPB aims to attract 90,000 employees to participate. HPB has been actively engaging trade associations, chambers and unions, such as Singapore Manufacturing Federation, Food Industry Asia, Singapore National Employees Federation, NTUC's U Live and Singapore International Chamber of Commerce to reach out to their member companies.We will continue to reach out to more corporations and individuals to participate in the National Steps ChallengeTM and adopt a healthy lifestyle."
measures to level playing field for gst-registered local suppliers vs non-gst registered overseas suppliers,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng asked the Minister for Finance in view of the rapid development of the digital economy whereby local businesses and consumers will increasingly buy goods and services from overseas suppliers (a) what steps are being taken to level the playing field between GST-registered local suppliers and non-GST registered overseas suppliers; and (b) when will the implementation of measures to level the playing field take place.,"Mr Heng Swee Keat: As mentioned by the Minister for Finance in his Budget statement in February this year, we are studying how we could make the necessary adjustments to our GST system, to ensure that local businesses which are GST-registered, are not disadvantaged due to digital transactions and cross-border trade.In May 2017, IRAS launched its consultation papers on the proposed reverse charge and overseas vendor registration regime to seek feedback and suggestions from the various stakeholders. IRAS is in the process of engaging these businesses and associations on the different ideas for taxing such cross-border goods and services in the digital economy. A wide range of segments are being engaged, including financial institutions, e-commerce companies, electronic marketplace operators, logistics players and consultancy firms. We are also monitoring developments in other countries. We will take into account the feedback gathered and the issues raised in our review. If any measure is to be announced by the Government, lead time will be provided for implementation."
tax regimes governing drivers of taxis and private-hire cars,"Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for Finance (a) whether there is a disparity between the tax regimes governing drivers of taxis and private-hire cars and, if so, what are the reasons for the differences; and (b) in view of the similarities between both types of point-to-point transport services, whether the Ministry has plans to bring the tax regimes in line with each other.","Mr Heng Swee Keat: Taxi drivers are allowed to claim tax deduction for expenses incurred in the production of their income. These tax-deductible expenses include vehicle rental fee, diesel, and parking charges.As for private-hire ride-hailing car drivers, deduction for tax is not allowed in respect of expenses incurred on the car. This is because such drivers cannot be assumed to use their cars pre-dominantly for business purposes. Many drive on a part-time or casual basis. This treatment supports our national policy to manage the car population, and is applied to both corporate and individual taxpayers. For example, companies are similarly not allowed to claim tax deduction on any expenses incurred for a private car.Private-hire ride-hailing car drivers can however claim deduction for other non-car expenses. Such allowable deductible expenses include commission paid to third-party operators, administrative charges imposed by third-party operators, and the proportion of expenses for mobile phones used in the course of providing their services.As the regulatory regimes and business models for taxi and ride-hailing services remain different, there are no plans to harmonise the tax regimes for now."
price gap between private housing and hdb resale and bto flats,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development whether the price gap between (i) private housing and HDB resale flats and (ii) private housing and HDB BTO flats has narrowed respectively since the Total Debt Servicing Ratio framework was implemented.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR) framework was introduced in June 2013 to safeguard financial prudence and prevent individuals from over-leveraging when they purchase private housing with housing loans from Financial Institutions (FIs). For those purchasing an HDB flat, they are likewise subject to a Mortgage Servicing Ratio (MSR) limit if they take an FI-originated or HDB housing loan. These measures have helped to moderate prices in both the private and public housing markets.The majority of HDB BTO flats built in the past few years were in non-mature estates, which are located in the outside central region (OCR). For this region, the median price gap between private housing and HDB BTO flats was 169% prior to June 2013 and is now 166%. Between private housing and HDB resale flats, the median price gap was 106% and is now 130%. However, as there are many different factors which could affect the prices of private and public housing, price comparisons between the two markets should be interpreted with care.The Government will continue to monitor the overall property market closely to ensure that it remains stable and sustainable."
life cycle assessment of plastic bags and takeaway containers,"Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether the Ministry has completed its study covering the life cycle assessment of the different types of single carrier plastic bags and common food and beverage takeaway containers in Singapore and, if not, when is this study expected to be completed; and (b) whether the Ministry has determined if emissions from bio-degradable plastic bags are lower than non bio-degradable ones.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The National Environment Agency (NEA) is studying the life cycle assessment of single-use carrier bags and disposable food packaging materials commonly used in Singapore. The studies analyse the cost and environmental impact, including emissions, of these materials.We will release the results of the study on single-use carrier bags by the end of this year. As for the study on disposable food packaging materials, we should complete it by end-2017 and release the results in the first half of 2018."
manpower for infrastructure projects,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether there are enough technicians and engineers to handle our infrastructure projects and their maintenance; and (b) what measures are in place to meet manpower shortfalls in this sector.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: As Singapore embarks on major infrastructural projects in the coming decades, the Government will continue to work closely with tripartite partners to build a strong pipeline of engineers and technicians to meet the sector's manpower needs.We expect the demand for technicians and engineers to grow steadily in the coming years. The railway sector, for example, employs more than 2,000 engineers and 4,000 technicians today and will need to employ another 1,500 by 2020. Another area of demand is for lift technicians as Singapore's built environment continues to transform. There are currently about 2,100 lift technicians and by 2020 we expect to employ another 1,000 more.The tripartite partners have worked together to formulate a package of measures to attract and retain talenti) Industry-wide branding and promotion of engineering and technical jobs. For example, in 2015, LTA established a $12.5 million Public Transport Manpower Development Fund, to support initiatives such as career fairs, internships and study awards to uplift the image of engineering and technical careers and attract new entrants to the industry.ii) Building a dedicated pipeline of engineering and technical expertise. We have also been ramping up the offering of training programmes at both the Pre-Employment Training (PET) and Continuing Education and Training (CET) levels, as well as structured on-the-job training. For example, BCA is partnering lift companies to offer scholarships / sponsorships to attract Singaporeans at the degree, diploma and ITE level to take up lift maintenance related courses and careers. For the railway sector, our ITE, Polytechnics, and Universities launched seven new railway engineering courses, ranging from NITEC to Masters. The first few batches of graduates will be ready to join the industry in the next one to two years. We are also working with programme partners to launch more rail-related Continuing Education and Training programmes, such as NTU's new Specialist Certificate in Civil Infrastructure Engineering to help environmental engineers gain civil engineering knowledge.iii) Attracting mid-career switchers. Agencies such as BCA and LTA have also been working with WSG and e2i to attract mid-career switchers through Professional Conversion Programmes (PCPs) by equipping workers from other sectors with the relevant competencies to embark on a career in the infrastructure sector."
enabling cashcard top-up on paynow system,Mr Ong Teng Koon asked the Prime Minister whether the Ministry will consider linking cashcards with the PayNow payment system in order to allow for seamless topping up of cashcards from mobile apps instead of via a physical top-up machine as cashcards are the only cards accepted across all payment platforms for motorists' payments including ERP and car parks.,"Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): Mr Ong's question refers to the CashCard issued by NETS, which can be used by motorists for ERP and car park payments. However, there are also other payment options.The existing NETS CashCard is a physical stored value facility that has been in use since 1995. The stored value in the CashCard can be topped up at NETS top-up machines, any local bank ATM, and at terminals at some convenience store chains3. This existing CashCard cannot be topped up through mobile apps or internet banking, such as through PayNow, as it requires a physical contact point for topping up.Besides the NETS CashCard, however, there are other options for motorists and those using public transit – namely the ez-link card and NETS FlashPay card. These cards are based on the Contactless e-Purse Application Standard (CEPAS). There are a few convenient ways to top up CEPAS cards, such as through automatic top-ups via Interbank Giro, credit and debit cards or via smartphones4, which removes the hassle of performing manual top-ups. Motorists can also sign up for electronic payment of ERP fees via EZ-Pay or NETS CashCard. These latter payment methods allow motorists to pay for ERP charges directly with their credit or debit cards.As for car parks, Mr Ong is right to say that the CashCard is the only payment card that can be accepted in all car parks. Most car parks are already on the Electronic Payment System (EPS) and accept both the CashCard and CEPAS cards. However, some of the older car parks cannot accept CEPAS cards – these are a declining minority, as car park operators upgrade their systems.Upcoming developments such as the Land Transport Authority's next generation ERP 2.0 system will be based on newer and more efficient technology, including cardless payments, to further improve motorists' experience."
review of mot and lta senior staff remuneration and bonuses,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Transport in light of staff bonuses of the MRT operator's maintenance team being affected by the recent episode of MRT tunnel flooding, whether this episode will also affect the compensation paid to senior staff in the Ministry and LTA who have been tasked with oversight of the MRT operator and, if so, how.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The responsibility for maintaining rail lines, including the flood prevention systems, lies with the operators. As the regulator, LTA sets the Operating and Maintenance Performance Standards, and carries out regular audits of the operators' maintenance regime and on-site inspections to ensure that these standards are complied with. LTA takes a risk-based approach and prioritises resources in areas which are assessed to be most complex, have the highest risk of failure and which could potentially have the biggest impact on the rail network. The anti-flooding systems are considered less of a high risk area compared to the other core railway systems as the constructs are relatively simple, easy to maintain and have ample provisions.Nonetheless, on 29 September 2017, in accordance with its regulatory role, LTA did expressly highlight to SMRT the importance of regular and diligent maintenance of tunnel pump systems and to surface a list of pumps requiring replacement to LTA. Unfortunately, the remedial actions instructed by LTA were not taken in time. The flooding incident occurred before the replacement programme could be completed. There is no evidence of shortcomings or lapses in regulatory oversight by LTA or MOT staff."
effectiveness of silver zones implementation,"Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Transport (a) how effective has the Silver Zones been in preventing accidents since their implementation; (b) what are the enhancements put in place to balance the needs of pedestrians, vehicles and emergency vehicles; and (c) how can Silver Zones be adapted to factor in the increased usage of personal mobility devices and bicycles which affect the elderly in using the pedestrian walkways.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Silver Zones improve road safety for seniors by slowing down traffic and alerting motorists to keep a look-out for pedestrians. Features include a reduced speed limit of 40km/h, speed bumps, ramps and barrier-free crossings, enhanced street lighting and longer green man timing. Silver Zones also use centre dividers to narrow lanes and reduce traffic speeds. These dividers are designed to be mountable to allow emergency vehicles to overtake.In the 11 locations where Silver Zones have been implemented, only three accidents involving seniors have occurred, compared to more than 50 such accidents in the five-year period preceding Silver Zones.LTA will widen footpaths where practicable at locations with large numbers of pedestrians and cyclists. Of the 11 completed Silver Zones, seven already have widened footpaths, or dedicated cycling paths to complement existing footpaths, and two more will have dedicated cycling paths by 2020. We will also implement speed regulating strips and prominent signs to remind cyclists and personal mobility device users to slow down ahead of crowded areas such as bus stops."

digital tv adoption by low income households under digital tv assistance scheme,"Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) whether the 160,000 low-income households identified for the Digital TV Assistance Scheme are equipped and ready for digital TV broadcasting; and (b) whether the Ministry plans to take further actions to facilitate digital TV adoption in Singapore before analogue broadcasting is phased out.","Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim: It is important that Singaporeans can continue to access Mediacorp's free-to-air channels (FTA) after analogue broadcasting is phased out, because these channels are freely accessible to all Singapore households and are a key source of news, information and entertainment in all four languages. Our FTA channels also carry Public Service Broadcast (PSB) programmes, which promote important societal values, celebrate our culture and heritage, and promote the Singapore identity. Today, about three in four Singapore households are already receiving Mediacorp's DTV channels either over the air, or through their Pay TV subscription.To help low income households migrate to DTV before analogue broadcasting is phased out, the then-Media Development Authority (now the Info-communications Media Development Authority, or IMDA) introduced the Digital TV Assistance Scheme (DTVAS) in September 2014. The DTVAS provides low income households with a free digital set-top box and indoor antenna, as well as free installation, to allow them to use their existing television sets to receive DTV. Since the launch of the DTVAS, IMDA has sent out notification letters to over 139,000 eligible households. As of 17 October 2017, about 64,000 DTVAS packages have been deployed, benefiting roughly one in two eligible households.IMDA is intensifying its outreach efforts to reach out to the remaining households who have not responded to the notification letters. Beyond intensive door-knock exercises, IMDA is also working with the grassroots, voluntary welfare organisations and senior activity centres to increase DTVAS awareness. Monthly DTV roadshows in the heartlands and booths in community events organised by the Citizens' Consultative Committees and Residents' Committees are also being organised. In addition, messages on analogue TV switch-off and DTV have been included in dialect programmes on Mediacorp channels, such as ""Jiak Ba Buay"" on Channel 8, to raise awareness amongst senior citizens.We recognise that ramping up efforts to increase awareness of DTV is necessary but not sufficient. Hence, we will be doing more. IMDA will shift the analogue TV switch-off date from end-2017 to end-2018. The extension will provide the public an additional year to switch over to DTV. The end-2018 date will also be more aligned to our neighbours' (that is, Malaysia and Indonesia) plans for analogue TV switch-off. This is relevant because the full benefits of freeing up spectrum from analogue TV switch-off can be reaped only when the region moves on this at the same time.At the same time, IMDA is also studying enhancements to the DTVAS with a view to assisting more HDB Singaporean households adopt DTV. IMDA will announce the enhancements to the DTVAS early next year.We remain committed to improving Singapore's digital readiness and enabling households to continue receiving PSB programmes upon analogue TV switch-off by 2018."
ensuring pedestrian safety at pedestrian crossings,"Mr Ong Teng Koon asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether there are plans for Government agencies such as the Traffic Police, LTA and NEA to work together to jointly deploy surveillance technologies to achieve their various goals including ensuring pedestrian safety at pedestrian crossings or zebra crossings.","15 Mr Ong Teng Koon asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is the number of accidents that have occurred in each of the past three years as a result of motor vehicles failing to slow down and take adequate care at pedestrian or zebra crossings; and (b) how does the Traffic Police ensure that motorists comply with existing traffic rules to slow down near such crossings.Mr K Shanmugam: Between 2014 and 2016, there were on average about 220 accidents involving pedestrians at signalised pedestrian crossings and zebra crossings each year. Most occurred because the motorist had failed to drive safely.The Traffic Police (TP) uses cameras to deter and detect irresponsible driving. Red-light and speeding cameras have been deployed at high-risk areas. TP also conducts enforcement operations at pedestrian crossings.To support its investigations into accidents, TP also obtains footages from the camera networks of other Government agencies, including the Land Transport Authority (LTA), the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) and the Housing Development Board (HDB).The availability of images from in-vehicle cameras has also helped. In December 2014, TP's 'E-Feedback on Road Users' portal was enhanced to allow members of the public to upload video footages. TP investigates all submitted footages.Penalties for irresponsible driving are heavy. A motorist who has caused death through rash driving is liable for imprisonment term for up to five years, a fine, or both. MHA is currently reviewing the penalties, to ensure that they remain an effective deterrent against irresponsible driving.Notwithstanding TP's various efforts, pedestrians, cyclists and users of personal mobility devices must themselves exercise due care before crossing the road, even when they have the right of way. They should always check for traffic to make sure that the road is clear before crossing."
reasons for pedestrian deaths caused by jaywalking from 2011 to 2016,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether the Ministry has done any study to understand the reasons for jaywalking and, if so, what is the outcome; (b) how many pedestrians have been killed over the past five years because of jaywalking; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider a public campaign against jaywalking.","Mr K Shanmugam: Between 2012 and 2016, on average, 20 jaywalkers were killed each year. Elderly pedestrians were especially vulnerable, accounting for about 60% of the fatalities.A 2015 study conducted by Traffic Police (TP) found that a key reason for jaywalking was that pedestrians did not consider jaywalking as unsafe to themselves or to other road users. This, of course, is a gross misperception.TP has stepped up its engagement efforts against jaywalking, especially vis-à-vis elderly pedestrians. In November last year, TP launched the Road Master Test Kit. The self-administered test kit allows elderly pedestrians to assess their eyesight, hearing and reaction time, and provides information on the risks of jaywalking. TP has been using the test kit to educate and engage elderly road users at Senior Activity Centres and community events. To date, TP has distributed a total of 4,000 test kits, and will continue to do so.TP also conducts wider engagement and education activities such as the ""Singapore Road Safety Month"", ""Shell Traffic Games"", and ""Use Your RoadSense"" campaigns. These campaigns help raise awareness of jaywalking as part of their wider emphasis on pedestrian and motorist safety. In addition, the Singapore Road Safety Council launched an online video in October 2017, to remind pedestrians on how to stay safe, including using only designated crossings, underpasses and overhead bridges, to cross the road."
disposable income limit to qualify for legal aid,"Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling asked the Minister for Law whether the current disposable income limit of $10,000 under the means testing to qualify for legal aid is still relevant compared with the cap of per capita income in other schemes which have increased over time.","Mr K Shanmugam: The Ministry of Law regularly reviews the means test which applicants have to satisfy for civil legal aid. Our last review was conducted in 2013, to allow approximately 25% of Singapore citizens and permanent residents to qualify for legal aid, up from 17% previously.To qualify for legal aid, an applicant's disposable income cannot be more than S$10,000 per year and his disposal capital cannot be more than S$10,000. Disposable income is different from gross income. Disposable income allows for permitted deductibles (such as the expenses of the applicant and his dependants, CPF contributions, and rent) to be excluded. For example, an applicant with three dependants and a gross annual income of S$60,000 may have an annual disposable income of less than S$10,000 after excluding all permitted deductibles. In this way, the permitted deductibles take into account the specific circumstances of the individual.In the 2013 review, permitted deductibles were raised to account for increases in the cost of living. In addition, a new deductible was introduced for family proceedings which involve children or protection orders to help the most vulnerable persons in a family dispute be eligible for legal aid. All these amendments help vulnerable applicants of limited means qualify for legal aid."
statistics of persons sued by public hospitals for arrears of hospital bills,"Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for Health for the last two years, how many persons have been sued in court by public hospitals for arrears of hospital bills.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: In the last two years, 26 individuals were issued writs of summons for the arrears of bills by our public healthcare institutions, of which 15 cases were settled out-of-court, one case resulted in default judgment and was resolved with the individual making payment, and the remaining 10 cases are still in progress. These figures exclude employers who are required to pay for their employees' medical bills but have not done so.It is important for patient bills to be paid promptly so as not to deprive public healthcare institutions of the resources they need to deliver healthcare services to patients. For Singaporeans, Government subsidies and MediShield Life cover a significant proportion of public hospital bills. Medisave can be used to help defray the costs of the remainder of the bill. Singaporeans who face difficulties with their healthcare bills can approach our medical social workers for assistance."
restrictions on retailers and merchants from selling dangerous objects to minors,"Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether there are restrictions against retailers and merchants from selling dangerous objects such as knives or blades to minors and, if not, whether the Ministry will consider reviewing their polices to do so.","Mr K Shanmugam: Police do not impose an age restriction on persons who are allowed to buy objects like blades and knives from retailers, and do not have the intention to do so for now. It is neither practical nor effective to regulate their sale as many of them, like kitchen knives and Swiss-army knives, are common items used for a myriad of everyday activities.However, anyone found in possession of blades and knives in a public area without a lawful purpose may be liable for the offence of possessing an offensive weapon under the Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act. The penalty is up to three years' imprisonment and caning of not less than six strokes."
plans for sla land at wan tho avenue leased to st john's home for elderly persons,"Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for Law what are SLA's plans for the 9,000 square metres of land that St John's Home for Elderly Persons currently leases and occupies at Wan Tho Avenue once the land is returned to SLA upon its lease expiry in 2021.",Mr K Shanmugam: The 0.9-hectare parcel which currently forms part of the premises occupied by the St John's Home for Elderly Persons (SJH) will return to the State upon expiry of the tenancy in 2021. This land parcel is currently zoned Civic and Community Institution in URA's Master Plan. Options being studied by agencies include introducing new community and social facilities that could serve the needs of the larger population over time. The detailed plans will be firmed up in due course. SJH is currently redeveloping and consolidating its operations within a separate 0.33-hectare parcel that it holds on a 30-year lease till 2045. Agencies will continue to work with SJH to ensure a smooth transition.
"percentage of re-employed workers on one-year, multi-year and renewed employment contracts",Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the current percentage of re-employed workers given one-year contracts and multi-year contracts respectively; and (b) what is the percentage of re-employed workers whose contracts are renewed after the end of the first and second contracts.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: Since re-employment was introduced in 2012, over 98% of private-sector local employees who wished to continue working at age 62 were offered re-employment.Among those offered re-employment at age 62 in 2016, two in three employees were able to continue on their existing contracts with no change in employment terms and conditions. For those offered re-employment on new contracts, one in three was offered contracts for a period of more than a year.We do not track the renewal of re-employment contracts of individual employees at the end of the first and second year of their re-employment. However, almost all private-sector local employees who were in employment when they turned 63 and 64 and wished to continue working, were offered re-employment. This suggests that older employees who want to continue working are given opportunities to continue to do so by their employers."
statistics on singapore citizenship granted to foreigners from 2008 to 2017,"Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for Home Affairs for each year from 2008 to 2017, what is the breakdown of the number of Singapore citizenship applications received and approved for (i) foreigners married to Singapore citizens (SCs) and with SC children (ii) foreigners married to SCs and with non-SC children (iii) foreigners married to SCs and with no children and (iv) foreigners on work passes.","Mr K Shanmugam: From 2008 to 2016, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) granted Singapore citizenship (SC) to around 20,000 individuals each year, of whom around 4,300 were married to Singaporeans. ICA is unable to break down the data by whether these individuals had any SC or non-SC children.Foreigners on work passes are not eligible for SC. They must have obtained Permanent Resident status before their SC application will be considered."
manpower for infrastructure projects,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether there are enough technicians and engineers to handle our infrastructure projects and their maintenance; and (b) what measures are in place to meet manpower shortfalls in this sector.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: As Singapore embarks on major infrastructural projects in the coming decades, the Government will continue to work closely with tripartite partners to build a strong pipeline of engineers and technicians to meet the sector's manpower needs.We expect the demand for technicians and engineers to grow steadily in the coming years. The railway sector, for example, employs more than 2,000 engineers and 4,000 technicians today and will need to employ another 1,500 by 2020. Another area of demand is for lift technicians as Singapore's built environment continues to transform. There are currently about 2,100 lift technicians and by 2020 we expect to employ another 1,000 more.The tripartite partners have worked together to formulate a package of measures to attract and retain talenti) Industry-wide branding and promotion of engineering and technical jobs. For example, in 2015, LTA established a $12.5 million Public Transport Manpower Development Fund, to support initiatives such as career fairs, internships and study awards to uplift the image of engineering and technical careers and attract new entrants to the industry.ii) Building a dedicated pipeline of engineering and technical expertise. We have also been ramping up the offering of training programmes at both the Pre-Employment Training (PET) and Continuing Education and Training (CET) levels, as well as structured on-the-job training. For example, BCA is partnering lift companies to offer scholarships / sponsorships to attract Singaporeans at the degree, diploma and ITE level to take up lift maintenance related courses and careers. For the railway sector, our ITE, Polytechnics, and Universities launched seven new railway engineering courses, ranging from NITEC to Masters. The first few batches of graduates will be ready to join the industry in the next one to two years. We are also working with programme partners to launch more rail-related Continuing Education and Training programmes, such as NTU's new Specialist Certificate in Civil Infrastructure Engineering to help environmental engineers gain civil engineering knowledge.iii) Attracting mid-career switchers. Agencies such as BCA and LTA have also been working with WSG and e2i to attract mid-career switchers through Professional Conversion Programmes (PCPs) by equipping workers from other sectors with the relevant competencies to embark on a career in the infrastructure sector."
enabling cashcard top-up on paynow system,Mr Ong Teng Koon asked the Prime Minister whether the Ministry will consider linking cashcards with the PayNow payment system in order to allow for seamless topping up of cashcards from mobile apps instead of via a physical top-up machine as cashcards are the only cards accepted across all payment platforms for motorists' payments including ERP and car parks.,"Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): Mr Ong's question refers to the CashCard issued by NETS, which can be used by motorists for ERP and car park payments. However, there are also other payment options.The existing NETS CashCard is a physical stored value facility that has been in use since 1995. The stored value in the CashCard can be topped up at NETS top-up machines, any local bank ATM, and at terminals at some convenience store chains3. This existing CashCard cannot be topped up through mobile apps or internet banking, such as through PayNow, as it requires a physical contact point for topping up.Besides the NETS CashCard, however, there are other options for motorists and those using public transit – namely the ez-link card and NETS FlashPay card. These cards are based on the Contactless e-Purse Application Standard (CEPAS). There are a few convenient ways to top up CEPAS cards, such as through automatic top-ups via Interbank Giro, credit and debit cards or via smartphones4, which removes the hassle of performing manual top-ups. Motorists can also sign up for electronic payment of ERP fees via EZ-Pay or NETS CashCard. These latter payment methods allow motorists to pay for ERP charges directly with their credit or debit cards.As for car parks, Mr Ong is right to say that the CashCard is the only payment card that can be accepted in all car parks. Most car parks are already on the Electronic Payment System (EPS) and accept both the CashCard and CEPAS cards. However, some of the older car parks cannot accept CEPAS cards – these are a declining minority, as car park operators upgrade their systems.Upcoming developments such as the Land Transport Authority's next generation ERP 2.0 system will be based on newer and more efficient technology, including cardless payments, to further improve motorists' experience."
review of mot and lta senior staff remuneration and bonuses,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Transport in light of staff bonuses of the MRT operator's maintenance team being affected by the recent episode of MRT tunnel flooding, whether this episode will also affect the compensation paid to senior staff in the Ministry and LTA who have been tasked with oversight of the MRT operator and, if so, how.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The responsibility for maintaining rail lines, including the flood prevention systems, lies with the operators. As the regulator, LTA sets the Operating and Maintenance Performance Standards, and carries out regular audits of the operators' maintenance regime and on-site inspections to ensure that these standards are complied with. LTA takes a risk-based approach and prioritises resources in areas which are assessed to be most complex, have the highest risk of failure and which could potentially have the biggest impact on the rail network. The anti-flooding systems are considered less of a high risk area compared to the other core railway systems as the constructs are relatively simple, easy to maintain and have ample provisions.Nonetheless, on 29 September 2017, in accordance with its regulatory role, LTA did expressly highlight to SMRT the importance of regular and diligent maintenance of tunnel pump systems and to surface a list of pumps requiring replacement to LTA. Unfortunately, the remedial actions instructed by LTA were not taken in time. The flooding incident occurred before the replacement programme could be completed. There is no evidence of shortcomings or lapses in regulatory oversight by LTA or MOT staff."
effectiveness of silver zones implementation,"Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Transport (a) how effective has the Silver Zones been in preventing accidents since their implementation; (b) what are the enhancements put in place to balance the needs of pedestrians, vehicles and emergency vehicles; and (c) how can Silver Zones be adapted to factor in the increased usage of personal mobility devices and bicycles which affect the elderly in using the pedestrian walkways.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Silver Zones improve road safety for seniors by slowing down traffic and alerting motorists to keep a look-out for pedestrians. Features include a reduced speed limit of 40km/h, speed bumps, ramps and barrier-free crossings, enhanced street lighting and longer green man timing. Silver Zones also use centre dividers to narrow lanes and reduce traffic speeds. These dividers are designed to be mountable to allow emergency vehicles to overtake.In the 11 locations where Silver Zones have been implemented, only three accidents involving seniors have occurred, compared to more than 50 such accidents in the five-year period preceding Silver Zones.LTA will widen footpaths where practicable at locations with large numbers of pedestrians and cyclists. Of the 11 completed Silver Zones, seven already have widened footpaths, or dedicated cycling paths to complement existing footpaths, and two more will have dedicated cycling paths by 2020. We will also implement speed regulating strips and prominent signs to remind cyclists and personal mobility device users to slow down ahead of crowded areas such as bus stops."
synchronisation of warning messages in kpe tunnel,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Transport (a) why were there different warning messages across the different platforms during the KPE tunnel fire that occurred on 29 August 2017; (b) what measures have been taken to synchronise them; and (c) how can fire fighters reach and access such fires in the tunnel in the event of a traffic jam.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: During the August 29 tunnel fire incident, there were different warning messages for motorists at different locations, as intended. Those inside the tunnel were advised via the tunnel messaging and broadcast system to exit the tunnel immediately if they could, or turn off their vehicle engines before evacuating via the nearest emergency exit if they could not. Motorists outside the tunnel were advised not to enter via electronic signboards, radio broadcast, and online and mobile platforms.However, for a short period after the fire was put out, the messages were not synchronised. Messages outside the tunnel had ceased to advise motorists not to enter, but the LTA tunnel broadcast system continued to ask motorists to evacuate the tunnel. This caused some initial confusion. LTA has since reviewed the process and fixed the problem.As there could be traffic congestion in the tunnel, the Singapore Civil Defence Force's fire fighters will respond to the site of the fire from both directions. Officers coming from the opposite direction at the incident location will access the site via cross-passage doors within the tunnel. Fire bikes will also be despatched, and fire fighting vehicles may travel on the road shoulder to reach the site."
number of work permit holders granted transfer of employer,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Manpower since the transfer policy was implemented for construction and process workers, (a) how many work permit holders have been granted a transfer of employer with the employer's agreement and without the employer's agreement respectively; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider extending the scheme to work permit holders in other sectors.","Mr Lim Swee Say: Since 2005, we allow work permit holders (WPHs) in the construction sector to change employers if their current employers agree. Since 2015, we also allow all construction sector WPHs to change employers at the end of their work permit term, if they are not able to come to a mutual agreement on the renewal of their work permits. Since June this year, we also allow WPHs in the process sector the same flexibilities. In addition, WPHs who have valid claims against their employers have been allowed to find another employer. The transfer policy improves productivity as employers benefit from hiring WPHs with work experience in Singapore. Employers also save on repatriation, search and hiring costs, as the WPHs do not have to leave Singapore.As of October 2017, approximately 128,000 WPHs changed employers before the end of their work permit terms with their employers' consent. Another 400 WPHs changed employers after completing their work permit terms.MOM is reviewing whether the transfer policy can be extended progressively to other sectors at an appropriate time, taking into account the impact on both businesses and workers."
rectification and remediation against supplier of steel products for mrt trains,"Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the recent admission by Kobe Steel Ltd on data falsification of the quality of its steel products involved products used in the construction of our MRT trains; and (b) if so, whether there are any plans to seek rectification and remedies against the parties concerned.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The Land Transport Authority has confirmed with all our MRT and LRT train manufacturers that no non-conforming products from Kobe Steel have been used in our trains. This includes the Kawasaki Heavy Industries (KHI)-CSR Sifang consortium that is replacing the car-body bolster for 26 North-South and East-West Lines trains, as well as manufacturing the new fleet of trains for the Thomson-East Coast Line. LTA officers based in Qingdao work closely with KHI-CSR Sifang to ensure that our trains are manufactured according to LTA’s specifications.The safety of commuters is our utmost concern. LTA will continue to monitor any new developments from the investigations into the quality of products manufactured by Kobe Steel."
records of maritime casualties in straits of singapore from 2007 to 2016,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Transport (a) other than cases involving loss of lives, pollution or safety of navigation, what are the categories of maritime casualties in the Straits of Singapore and the port of Singapore which MPA keeps records of; and (b) what is the number of such cases in each of the past 10 years.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Other than major marine incidents involving loss of lives, pollution or safety of navigation, MPA also tracks reported incidents of lesser severity within our port limits and the Straits of Singapore (Singapore Territorial Waters). Between 2007 and 2017, there has been an average of nine collision, nine sinking, 30 grounding and 71 contact incidents reported in these waters per year."
breakdown of worker profiles in the finance industry from 2012 to 2017,"Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling asked the Minister for Manpower (a) from 2012 to 2017, what is the proportion of contract versus permanent workers in the finance industry; (b) what is the breakdown of locals and foreigners in this sector over the same period; and (c) what percentage of experienced workers in finance and below 40 years of age continue to remain within the industry.","Mr Lim Swee Say: Consistently between 2012 and 2016, over 90% of the local workforce in the financial and insurance services sector were permanent workers. In addition, locals accounted for more than 80% of the workforce in this sector. Among all local workers aged below 40 who were in the financial and insurance services sector in 2012, close to 70% were still working in the same sector in 2016."
singaporeans employed by majority foreign-owned companies,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how many Singaporeans are currently employed by companies in Singapore that are more than 50% owned by foreigners; and (b) what is breakdown of this number by (i) age group (ii) educational level and (iii) percentage of the total Singaporean workforce.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: The number of workers5 employed in majority foreign-owned enterprises6 is provided in Table 1. Breakdown by residential status, age group and educational level is not available."
use/investment of cryptocurrencies,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Prime Minister (a) whether the Government is keeping track of the use/investment of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin in Singapore; (b) how do cryptocurrencies affect our finance industry; (c) whether studies are being conducted to assess the problems and risks of using/investing in cryptocurrencies; and (d) whether regulatory frameworks are necessary in the future.,"Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): We are familiar with money, i.e. notes and coins, as a medium of exchange – an intermediary instrument use to facilitate transactions. I make a TV, sell it for money, and then use it to buy a pair of shoes. Money becomes a medium of exchange because all of us put our trust in its reliability. The Central Bank issues these notes and coins, and makes them legal tender. Legal tender means that the medium of exchange is recognised by law to be valid for meeting a financial obligation.With advancement in technology, new virtual means of payment have emerged, such as cryptocurrency, which is a form of digital token secured by cryptography. They are not legal tender. But some people put their trust in them and use them as a means of payment. Hence, Bitcoin and Ether have been adopted by people in some communities to pay one another or to pay for goods and services.The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has been monitoring the use of such virtual currencies. Their use is not prevalent in Singapore – about 20 Singapore retailers like restaurants and online shops currently accept Bitcoins3. This is unlike places like Japan, where the use is more popular. Likewise, in the Singapore financial industry, use of virtual currencies as a mode of payment is not significant. Trading is generally for speculative investment purposes, and the volume is low4 compared to other countries such as US, Japan and Hong Kong.Similar to most jurisdictions, MAS does not regulate such virtual currencies per se. However we regulate the activities that surround them if those activities fall within our more general ambit as financial regulator. Let me give two examples.First, virtual currencies, due to the anonymous nature of the transactions, can be exploited for money laundering and terrorism financing risks. MAS is working on a new payment services regulatory framework that will address these risks.A second example is fund-raising. Virtual currencies can go beyond being a means of payment, and evolve into ""second generation"" tokens representing benefits such as ownership in assets, like a share or bond certificate. The sale of such ""second generation"" tokens to raise funds is commonly known as an initial coin offering or ICO (“ICO”). A number of ICOs have been structured out of Singapore in recent months.These are financial activities that fall under MAS' regulatory ambit. Hence, on 1 August 2017, MAS clarified that if a token is structured in the form of securities, the ICO must comply with existing securities laws aimed at safeguarding investors' interest. So the requirements of having to register a prospectus, obtain intermediary or exchange operator licences, will apply. These intermediaries must also comply with existing rules on anti-money laundering and countering terrorism financing.MAS has not issued new legislation specifically for ICOs. We will continue to monitor the developments of such offers, and consider more targeted legislation if necessary.Some consumers may be attracted to invest in virtual currencies and digital tokens due to their recent exponential rise in value. However, as a financial regulator, our focus is securitised interests in assets – such as shares in a company. MAS does not and cannot regulate all products that people put their money in thinking that they will appreciate in value. But recognising that the risks of investing in virtual currencies are significant, MAS and the Commercial Affairs Department have published an advisory alerting consumers to these risks, and are working together to raise public awareness of potential scams."
incidences of freon gas leaks on mrt and lrt rail systems,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Transport (a) how many incidences of freon gas leaks on the MRT and LRT rail systems have occurred over the past 10 years; and (b) what is the risk posed to commuters by such gas leaks.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Over the past 10 years, there have been 23 instances of Freon gas leaks on trains. Freon gas can interact with moisture in the air to form an odourless white smoke. The smoke poses no health risk to the public. As soon as a leak is reported, affected commuters are de-trained at the next station, and the train withdrawn for repair."
terms for extension of formula one singapore grand prix,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (a) what are the terms for the extension of the Formula One Singapore Grand Prix for another four years; and (b) whether there is any evaluation of the benefits of the extension as against the inconvenience caused to drivers and retailers.,"Mr S Iswaran: The exact terms of the agreement between the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) and the race promoter, Singapore Grand Prix Pte Ltd (SGP), are subject to business confidentiality. Nevertheless, the decision to continue hosting the Formula One Singapore Grand Prix for another four years, from 2018 to 2021, was made after careful deliberation of the expected benefits and costs from a national perspective, taking into account the impact on various stakeholders.Including the 2017 race, Singapore would have hosted over 450,000 international visitors, contributing about $1.4 billion in incremental tourism receipts.7 The race has also generated business opportunities for local companies, with more than 90% of race-related works sub-contracted to Singapore-based companies. In addition, there are indirect benefits, as the Formula One Singapore Grand Prix has boosted Singapore's image as a vibrant and innovative city due to the high global viewership and media coverage. Over the years, the Singapore race has built up a significant brand and following, successfully establishing itself as a signature race on the F1 calendar that has been referred to as the ""crown jewel"" of the sport. We expect to sustain such benefits in the new term, and to reduce the cost of organising the race to $135 million per year, with the Government’s share remaining at 60%. This cost reduction is due to factors such as operational efficiencies.The Formula One Singapore Grand Prix is iconic because it is a night race on a street circuit. However, we recognise that it may cause inconvenience to segments of the public, such as drivers and retailers. Over the years, the Government agencies have worked with the race promoter and affected stakeholders to find ways to better plan and coordinate the race execution, to minimise these inconveniences.To reduce the impact on road traffic and drivers, we have halved the number of days for road closures from 12 days in 2008, to 6 days in 2017. The introduction of the Circle Line and Downtown Line has also increased accessibility to the race vicinity during the F1 period and alleviated the traffic congestion. In addition, STB has worked with various stakeholders, including retailers, to capitalise on the buzz created by the race by launching the Grand Prix Season Singapore (GPSS) – a season of lifestyle events complementing the race experience.The extension of the Formula One Singapore Grand Prix for another four years was decided on terms that are beneficial to all parties. STB will continue to work closely with other Government agencies and stakeholders to enhance the event experience for Singaporeans and visitors, while minimising inconveniences to the public."
juvenile delinquents by gender since 2013,"Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked the Minister for Home Affairs in respect of annual statistics for juvenile delinquents since 2013 and by gender (a) what are the five main categories of crimes committed; (b) what are the distributions by age groups (below 13, 13-14, 15-16, above 16 years old); and (c) what are the distributions by racial groups.","Mr K Shanmugam: The youth crime situation in Singapore is under control. The number of youth offenders arrested has gone down in the past decade by about 35%, from 4,280 in 2006 to 2,788 in 2016.Shop Theft, Bicycle Theft, Other Forms of Theft, Rioting, and Sexual Penetration of Minor under 16 Years Old, were the most common offences.The age and gender distribution of youth offenders from 2013 to June 2017 is in the table below.There is an over-representation of minority races among youth offenders. Police work with self-help and community groups including Yayasan MENDAKI and Singapore Indian Development Association (SINDA), to address these concerns.Indeed, youth crime is a multi-faceted problem that requires a multi-agency approach for effective and lasting results. Educational institutions, other law enforcement agencies, the social services sector and parents all have a role to play. Police will continue to work with relevant stakeholders and partners to keep our youths away from crime."
motorists and taxi drivers committing same traffic offence in past three years,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) how many motorists have committed the same traffic offence (i) once (ii) twice and (iii) more than thrice in each of the past three years; (b) what is the percentage of such offenders against the total number of licensed motorists; (c) how many of such offences have been successfully appealed against; and (d) what is the percentage of successful appeals out of the total number of offences in each category.,"14 Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) how many taxi drivers have committed the same traffic offence (i) once (ii) twice and (iii) more than thrice per year in each of the past three years; (b) what is the percentage of such offenders against the total number of licensed taxi drivers; (c) how many offences have been successfully appealed against; and (d) what is the percentage of successful appeals out of the total number of offences by taxi drivers in each category.Mr K Shanmugam: The majority of motorists who committed traffic violations were not repeat offenders.For the most common traffic violation of speeding, in the past three years, 4.7% of all licensed motorists were first-time offenders, 0.6% had offended twice, while 0.1% had offended more than twice.The numbers are lower for other violations. In the past three years, for running a red light, 1.6% of all licensed motorists were first-time offenders, while 0.02% were repeat offenders.The proportion of taxi drivers who were traffic offenders was higher.For speeding, in the past three years, 8.9% of all taxi drivers were first-time offenders, 2.2% had offended twice, while 0.8% had offended more than twice.For running a red light, 2.7% of all taxi drivers were first-time offenders, while 0.1% were repeat offenders.The Traffic Police (TP) has continually engaged motorists, taxi drivers, the taxi companies and National Taxi Association (NTA) on safe driving practices. For example, TP has collaborated with taxi companies to remind taxi drivers of accident-prone and enforcement areas through the Mobile Data Terminals in taxis. To reduce speeding and beating of red lights, TP has erected more prominent warning signs of the use of enforcement cameras.In respect of appeals, it has to be noted that traffic violations impact on the safety of other motorists and pedestrians. Very few appeals are acceded to, and only where there are very strong extenuating factors such as a medical emergency."
progress of study on archaeology in singapore,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) whether the Ministry can provide an update on the progress of the study on archaeology in Singapore that has been undertaken to address gaps in law and regulations in this field; and (b) when can the findings and recommendations of the study be published.","Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: The review carried out by the National Heritage Board (NHB) of its legal powers on archaeology is on-going.NHB met members of the archaeology community in 2016 to gather feedback on proposed legislative amendments to the NHB Act and NHB's archaeology related strategies and initiatives.Based on feedback gathered from these engagement sessions, we agreed that there is a need to do the followingClarify the ownership of archaeological artefacts recovered;Put in place regulations or guidelines governing how Singapore conducts archaeological excavations;Report all archaeological finds to NHB;Ensure that archaeological excavations or investigations are conducted at an early stage or in tandem with development works where necessary; andProtect maritime archaeological sites and artefacts.NHB is exploring legislative changes to the NHB Act to address the above issues and will be organising another session with the stakeholders in October 2017 to seek their views for the various legislative changes, strategies and initiatives that are being proposed to protect Singapore’s archaeological heritage.NHB will also seek feedback on its approach and strategies for archaeology during the public consultation phase for the broader Heritage Plan for Singapore in early 2018. Following this, the final strategies and initiatives regarding archaeology will be announced next year, at the launch of the Heritage Plan for Singapore."
average response time by emergency services to road accidents,"Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) since 2015, what has been the average response time by the emergency services to road accidents involving injuries and fatalities; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider new systems, such as eCall which is an emergency call feature installed in all cars sold within the EU, to reduce the response time by automatically calling the nearest emergency centre.","Mr K Shanmugam: Over the past three years, SCDF responded to road traffic accidents that required rescue operations (such as the extrication of trapped victims), within 8 minutes, 90.1% of the time. SCDF responded to other road traffic accidents that required ambulances to attend to injuries but did not require rescue operations, within 11 minutes, 84.6% of the time. These were within SCDF's target response times for rescue and ambulance calls respectively.An eCall system involves the installation of an in-vehicle device, which will automatically contact and send its location to a helpline in the event of an accident. The eCall system can help to improve response time, but it also faces implementation challenges such as high false alarm rates. SCDF will continue to monitor the development of the eCall system as well as other technologies, and study their applicability to Singapore.SCDF must always be ready to respond to emergencies promptly. False alarms, non-emergency and nuisance calls bog down SCDF's '995' call centre, impose additional load on SCDF's resources, and deprive persons in distress of timely intervention from SCDF. We urge members of the public to exercise civic responsibility and call '995' only when necessary."
review of hdb's goodwill repair assistance scheme,"Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry will consider reviewing the Goodwill Repair Assistance Scheme to (i) have HDB bear the full cost of repairs for ceiling leaks/structural defects resulting from normal wear and tear or (ii) have only the unit owner who had carried out internal renovation works that may have led to the ceiling leaks, to co-share the cost of the goodwill repairs with HDB.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Flat owners are responsible for the maintenance of the interior of their flats. The repair of leaks in the party structure (i.e. the floor slab between flats) is a joint responsibility between upper- and lower-floor flat owners. Hence, when there is a leak, both upper- and lower-floor flat owners will need to liaise with one another to investigate and carry out repairs.Notwithstanding, HDB does offer assistance to affected flat owners through the Goodwill Repair Assistance (GRA) scheme where HDB pays 50% of the ceiling leak repair cost, while the remaining 50% is shared equally between the upper- and lower-floor flat owners. There is no plan for HDB to bear the full cost of repairs under the GRA scheme, as this would remove the responsibility of flat owners for the maintenance and upkeep of their flat.The GRA provides assistance to flat owners to repair ceiling leaks and spalling concrete due to natural wear and tear. For cases where investigations ascertain that leaks are due to renovations carried out at the upper floor flat, the upper floor flat owner will be fully responsible for rectifying the leak, and will have to bear the full cost of repair."
hdb flat owners illegally acquiring another property within minimum occupancy period and selling their hdb flat thereafter,"Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for National Development whether HDB will update its powers under the Housing and Development Act to enable it to take enforcement action against flat owners who, within the minimum occupancy period, acquire an interest in another property in contravention of HDB regulations and thereafter sell their HDB flat to prevent the flat from being acquired under section 56(1) of the Act.","Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB flats are public housing and are meant for owner occupation. The purchase of another property by an HDB flat owner within the minimum occupation period is an infringement under the Housing & Development (H&D) Act. The penalty for such infringements is the compulsory acquisition of the HDB flat under Section 56 1(b) of the H&D Act, or the imposition of a financial penalty on the flat owners under the Housing and Development (Financial Penalties) Rules 2015.HDB monitors and takes enforcement actions against flat owners who acquire an interest in another property in contravention of HDB regulations. In addition, there are safeguards in place to prevent such flat owners from selling their HDB flat, to prevent the flat from being acquired under Section 56 (1) of the Act. The flat owner will only be allowed to sell the HDB flat after investigations on any suspected infringement are completed, and the appropriate action taken. At this juncture, HDB has sufficient legislative powers to take action against such flat owners."
sugar content in formula milk,Mr Yee Chia Hsing asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry currently monitors or regulates the amount of sugar in infant and children's formula milk so as to prevent an excessive preference for sweetness in later years.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Based on a recent survey by the Health Promotion Board (HPB), none of the infant formula milk for children 0 to 12 months contained any added sugar. As for children's formula milk for 1 year and above, two products contained added sugar of around 2g per 100ml of milk. Another product, a high-calorie formula for supplemental nutrition, contained 7g of added sugar per 100ml of milk.HPB recommends that children aged 1 year and above can take full cream milk, if they are eating and growing well. HPB further recommends that parents planning to give their children high-calorie formula milk as a nutritional supplement should consult their child’s paediatrician or nutritionist."
withdrawal of subsidies for seniors' mobility and enabling fund,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Health under what circumstances will subsidies for the Seniors' Mobility and Enabling Fund be withdrawn if there are no changes in one's household income.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Under the Seniors' Mobility & Enabling Fund (SMF), Singaporeans aged 60 years and above can apply for means-tested subsidies to offset the cost of assistive devices, home healthcare items and transport services to MOH-funded eldercare and dialysis centres. They would need to meet the scheme’s household monthly income criteria and assessed by qualified healthcare staff to require the equipment or services to live independently in the community.As long as they continue to receive care services and the eligibility conditions continue to be met, the SMF subsidies will not be withdrawn. Seniors with queries or appeals on the SMF can contact the Agency for Integrated Care."
environmental impact assessment/studies for land acquisition for expansion of tengah air base,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for National Development whether any environmental impact assessment or studies have been done in relation to the land acquisition for the expansion of Tengah Air Base.,Mr Lawrence Wong: An environmental study will be carried out before the land preparation works for the expansion of Tengah Air Base (TAB) commence. The study will guide the implementation of mitigation measures to minimise the potential impact of the TAB expansion on flora and fauna in that area.
opening of artic and other regional trade and connectivity routes,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Transport with the increasing viability of the Arctic shipping route and the potential opening of other regional trade and connectivity routes (a) how is Singapore re-positioning itself to meet such challenges; and (b) how will PSA need to transform to thrive in the new trade landscape.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: At present, it is too early to determine the long term impact of the opening of the Arctic shipping routes on the port of Singapore. Current commercial viability of these routes is low for a number of reasons. Sailing through the Arctic is still largely confined to the summer months, making it difficult to operate scheduled services, which is critical to container shipping. There are also limited opportunities for shippers to lift and drop off cargo as areas enroute through the Arctic are largely unpopulated. Further, ships sailing through the Arctic require specialised ice-breaking equipment, and have to pay higher insurance premiums due to the extreme conditions. In 2016, only 19 sailings were made through the Northern Sea Route, which is the main Arctic sea route.Regardless of the competition posed by the Arctic shipping routes and other regional trade and connectivity routes, our priority has been to ensure that the port of Singapore continues to improve its competitiveness. We have plans to increase port capacity, so that Singapore has the capacity to meet the long term needs of container lines. To this end, development on the new Tuas Terminal has commenced and when fully completed, this terminal will be able to handle up to 65m twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs).The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore is also working closely with PSA to build a better port through investing heavily in technology. For instance, PSA has deployed a fully-automated yard crane system at the new berths at the Pasir Panjang Terminal to enhance efficiency, reliability and workplace safety.The Government will continue to monitor global developments and work with industry partners to ensure that Singapore retains its edge as a global hub port and international maritime centre."
accidents involving e-bikes and personal mobility devices,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the number of accidents involving e-bikes and personal mobility devices this year; (b) what is the number of injuries or fatalities that have resulted from these accidents; and (c) what are LTA's plans to reduce or mitigate such accidents from occurring.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: For the first half of this year, there were about 90 accidents involving power-assisted bicycles (PABs) and personal mobility devices (PMDs), resulting in four deaths and about 90 injuries. The majority of these accidents took place on the roads.With the passage of the Active Mobility Bill, rules on safe riding behaviour, including speed limits and device specifications, will come into force by the end of this year. There will be stiff penalties for offences such as reckless riding. In the meantime, LTA is stepping up its enforcement efforts and has issued over 1,400 advisories for unsafe riding. LTA has also commenced registration of PABs.We will continue to complement enforcement efforts with public education and outreach programmes. The Safe Riding Programme will be launched to educate cyclists and PMD users on safe riding practices. More than 800 people have volunteered for the Active Mobility Patrol Scheme and are helping to educate fellow residents on safe riding practices."
accidents involving unauthorised and illegally modified power-assisted bicycles,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Transport (a) of the number of accidents involving power-assisted bicycles in the past two years, what percentage of these cases involve power-assisted bicycles which have not been authorised for use in Singapore or have been illegally modified; (b) whether any penalty has been imposed in all these cases specifically for unauthorised use or illegal modification; and (c) if so, what have been the penalties imposed.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: We currently do not track the number of accidents involving power-assisted bicycles (PABs) that are non-compliant for use in Singapore or have been illegally modified. However, moving forward, LTA will work towards tracking such cases as part of enforcement actions against errant PAB users.Users of non-compliant or illegally modified PABs may be fined up to $5,000, or jailed up to three months, or both for the first offence. For subsequent offences, the offender may be fined up to $10,000, or jailed up to six months, or both."
proportion of workers re-employed over last five years,"Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the proportion of workers re-employed over the last five years, and (b) what is the proportion of re-employed workers who are re-employed without wage adjustments.","Mr Lim Swee Say: Based on MOM’s Labour Market Supplementary Survey, from 2012 to 2016, over 98% of private sector local employees who wished to continue working were offered re-employment at age 62. This included over 95% who accepted re-employment in the same job, be it on a new or existing contract.Of those who accepted re-employment in the same job at age 62, around 96% did not receive any cut in basic wages in 2012. This proportion rose to 98% in 2016."
number of children referred to early intervention programme for infants and children in last five years,"Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) in the last five years, what is the number of children referred to the Early Intervention Programme for Infants and Children (EIPIC); (b) what is the current average waiting time for the child to be enrolled in EIPIC centres upon application; and (c) whether there are initiatives in place to enhance the curriculum for EIPIC and building the capabilities of the educators who deliver the programme.","Mr Desmond Lee: The Early Intervention Programme for Infants and Children (EIPIC) provides developmental and therapy services for infants and young children at risk of moderate to severe developmental delays. Early intervention maximises their developmental potential and minimises the risk of secondary disabilities developing.There are currently 21 EIPIC centres run by 10 Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs) located across Singapore. From 2012 to 2016, a total of about 6,500 children were referred to EIPIC centres, or approximately 1,300 children annually.The average waiting time for enrolment in an EIPIC centre today is approximately five months, a reduction from the six month waiting time in 2016. By 2018, there will be 500 more EIPIC places, bringing the total to 3,200 places. This should bring down the waiting time further.Parents may also consider enrolling their children in selected private early intervention centres under the Pilot for Private Intervention Providers (PPIP) programme. This serves as an alternative to VWO EIPIC centres. Children enrolled in these centres are similarly subsidised for the early intervention programme.Currently, children with mild developmental needs are supported through the Development Support (DS) programmes in selected preschools. MSF is studying how DS can be enhanced to support children with moderate developmental needs within the preschool setting. This will facilitate timely support and intervention for children with mild to moderate developmental needs in their natural setting.All EIPIC teachers must hold an Advanced Diploma in Early Childhood Intervention (Special Needs) (ADESN).MSF is currently working with the National Council of Social Service and SkillsFuture Singapore to develop the Skills Framework for Social Service (SF-SS), which will be ready in 2018. The framework will include a skills map that articulates the skills and competencies required to enter the profession and progress as EIPIC teachers, as well as professional development programmes that EIPIC teachers can take on for skills upgrading and mastery. This will better equip both existing EIPIC teachers and potential entrants to identify relevant training opportunities, and plan their professional development pathways.MSF has also appointed consultants from KK Women's and Children's Hospital and National University Hospital to help EIPIC centres build capabilities and enhance early intervention standards."
vessels using/transiting straits of singapore and other waters under jurisdiction of singapore vessel traffic service,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Transport in each of the past 10 years (a) what has been the number of vessels using and/or transiting through the Straits of Singapore and other waters under the jurisdiction of the Singapore Vessel Traffic Service; and (b) what has been the number of reported collisions, sinkings, groundings and contacts with fixed objects involving one or more vessels in the Straits of Singapore and other waters under the jurisdiction of the Singapore Vessel Traffic Service.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The Singapore Strait is a busy waterway with 84,000 vessels transiting through it in 2016. The Singapore port is also a major transhipment hub and receives an average of 380 vessels a day, or close to 139,000 vessels a year.Despite the heavy traffic, the number of major incidents has dropped over the years, from 13 in 2011, to 1 each in 2015 and 2016. See Table 1.Table 1 Vessel Traffic and Major Incidents in Singapore Waters"
opening of artic and other regional trade and connectivity routes,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Transport with the increasing viability of the Arctic shipping route and the potential opening of other regional trade and connectivity routes (a) how is Singapore re-positioning itself to meet such challenges; and (b) how will PSA need to transform to thrive in the new trade landscape.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: At present, it is too early to determine the long term impact of the opening of the Arctic shipping routes on the port of Singapore.

efforts to strengthen singaporean core,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether he can provide an update on the Ministry's efforts in strengthening the Singaporean core and in particular (i) the total number of companies on the watchlist and (ii) the number of 'triple weak' companies where executive measures have been taken against them; and (b) whether the Ministry will take harsher measures against recalcitrant companies such as a moratorium on obtaining government contracts or penal sanctions.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: To encourage employers to strengthen the complementarity of foreign manpower with our local workforce instead of substituting foreigners for local workers, we take into consideration whether the employers have treated our local workers fairly when we process their applications for Employment Passes (EP). While the vast majority of employers are fair, there is evidence that a small minority are not. For these employers, we subject their EP applications to further scrutiny under the Fair Consideration Framework Watchlist.We currently have about 300 firms on the Watchlist. The Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices has been working with them to improve their HR practices. More than 60 firms have already made significant improvements and exited the Watchlist, while 25 firms that remain uncooperative have had their work pass privileges curtailed. In all, about 1,700 EP applications were either withdrawn by the firms, or rejected or withheld by MOM. Over the same period, these firms considered Singaporeans more fairly and hired about 1,700 more Singaporean PMETs. We will continue to help them improve their HR practices.At the other end of the spectrum, there are progressive employers who believe in strengthening their Singaporean Core and nurturing human capital as their core asset. We have recognised over 70 of them under the Human Capital Partnership Programme. We support them proactively with relevant grants and incentives under various government schemes to develop their employees and strengthen their Singaporean core. Their work pass applications are also processed more timely. We will continue to grow the community of progressive employers with our tripartite partners and sector agencies."
accidents involving e-bikes and personal mobility devices,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the number of accidents involving e-bikes and personal mobility devices this year; (b) what is the number of injuries or fatalities that have resulted from these accidents; and (c) what are LTA's plans to reduce or mitigate such accidents from occurring.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: For the first half of this year, there were about 90 accidents involving power-assisted bicycles (PABs) and personal mobility devices (PMDs), resulting in four deaths and about 90 injuries.

"auto-inclusion, application and funding for adapt and grow schemes","Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Ministry will consider auto-inclusion, auto-application and auto-funding for the Adapt and Grow schemes such as the career support programmes instead of making employers and companies apply for the schemes.","Mr Lim Swee Say: A vast majority of jobseekers and employers are able to find suitable matches on their own through recruitment agencies, job advertisements, job portals or their own networks. Adapt and Grow schemes, such as the Professional Conversion Programme and the Career Support Programme, are intended to provide targeted help for jobseekers who need additional assistance to overcome skills requirements or wage expectation mismatches. These schemes provide substantial training and temporary wage support to help jobseekers (especially mature and/or long term unemployed) and their prospective employers to bridge gaps in skills or wage expectations, so that they can better secure job matches.Auto-inclusion, auto-application or auto-funding approaches would not only require significantly more public funding, but also weaken our efforts in targeting support at those who truly need the extra assistance."
longer pre-defined time period at signalised pedestrian crossings,"Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for Transport (a) what factors does LTA consider when the pre-defined time period for pedestrians to cross at signalled pedestrian crossings is increased; and (b) whether LTA will consider increasing such pre-defined time period by up to five or ten seconds in mature neighbourhoods or at roads that cannot be enhanced as Silver Zones due to the high volume of traffic, due to an increasing elderly population.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The main factor is the width of the road. All signalised pedestrian crossings are programmed with a steady green man time of six to 10 seconds, and a flashing green man time of one second per metre in road width.Pedestrian crossings that are used by high numbers of seniors or persons with disabilities have the Green Man Plus scheme. When these pedestrians tap their concession cards on the reader, they will have more time to cross. Depending on the width of the road, the green man time can be extended by up to 13 seconds. There are currently 760 Green Man Plus crossings, and we will increase this number to 1000 by end-2018."
accidents involving unauthorised and illegally modified power-assisted bicycles,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Transport (a) of the number of accidents involving power-assisted bicycles in the past two years, what percentage of these cases involve power-assisted bicycles which have not been authorised for use in Singapore or have been illegally modified; (b) whether any penalty has been imposed in all these cases specifically for unauthorised use or illegal modification; and (c) if so, what have been the penalties imposed.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: We currently do not track the number of accidents involving power-assisted bicycles (PABs) that are non-compliant for use in Singapore or have been illegally modified.

juvenile offenders admitted into juvenile homes since 2013,"Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) how many juvenile offenders have been admitted into juvenile homes each year since 2013, by gender; and (b) what is the average length of stay in the homes, by gender.","Mr Desmond Lee: Under the Children and Young Persons Act, juveniles who commit offences may be ordered by the Youth Court to be sent to a Juvenile Rehabilitation Centre (JRC) or a Place of Detention. Those sent to a Place of Detention are typically also placed on probation.The Singapore Boys' Home (SBH) and Singapore Girls' Home (SGH) function as both types of facilities. The number of juveniles admitted to SBH and SGH each year is in Table 1.Of the juvenile offenders who were discharged from the JRC between 2013 and 2016, the average duration of stay was 20 months in SBH and 24 months in SGH. In that same period, the average duration of stay for those discharged from a Place of Detention was three weeks each in SBH and SGH."
racial and household income distributions of students in primary and secondary schools,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Education (Schools) (a) what percentage of the racial and household income distributions of students in the primary and secondary schools differs from the national racial and income distributions; (b) whether such differences have an impact on the schools' results; and (c) what measures are in place to assist schools where there is a negative impact from the difference in racial and income distributions.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: While all our primary and secondary schools deliver the national curriculum, they may vary in terms of the distinctive programmes they offer, their culture and other characteristics. Together, these factors influence parent and student choice, and contribute to variations in ethnic and socio-economic profile of students in each school.Today, about 1 in 10 schools differ noticeably from the national norm in terms of racial distribution, excluding the SAP schools which would naturally have a much higher proportion of Chinese than the national norm. The numbers have remained stable over the last few years. MOE currently does not collect information on students’ household income across the system.Worldwide, socio-economic status, or SES, is known to correlate positively with students’ academic performance. As for ethnicity, while we see differences in the performance of students from the different ethnic groups, the performance of Malay students at the national examinations has improved over time, closing the gap with the students from other ethnic groups.However, SES and ethnicity are not the key determinants of student performance. Many other factors contribute to student achievement, including student motivation, as well as support at home and from the broader community, and the quality of school experience.What is more important is that MOE is committed to provide a quality education for our students regardless of their background. All school leaders and teachers undergo quality and continuous professional development and good practices are disseminated across schools, with high quality curriculum resources are centrally provided. MOE also resources schools based on their needs and student profiles. For example, depending on the profile of the school, more manpower may be provided for counselling and student support and levelling-up programmes, such as the Learning Support Programmes and the School-based Dyslexia Remediation Programme. Financial assistance has also been enhanced to ensure that needy students can continue to access education. MOE also partners with the community, including Self-Help Groups (SHGs), to reach out to families or students who need additional assistance beyond MOE.Through these efforts, our schools have shown results in enabling their students, regardless of their background, to excel and perform beyond expectation. According to the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), a series of international studies conducted by the OECD, Singapore consistently has one of the highest percentages of resilient students (i.e. students from disadvantaged background but achieve good performance in school) among the participating countries. MOE will continue to ensure that an education in our schools remain accessible to all Singaporeans and that no one will be left behind."
outcome of pilot installation of food waste digesters in schools,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what is the outcome of the pilot installation of food waste digesters in schools; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider installing such food waste digesters in more schools and other places such as hawker centres and coffee shops to promote recycling.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: In April this year, the National Environment Agency (NEA) launched the 'Love Your Food @ Schools' Project to encourage schools to establish a culture of not wasting food. To complement this food waste reduction effort, NEA partnered 10 schools to pilot the use of food waste digesters, and to involve them in a range of activities such as food waste segregation, educational talks on food waste, and learning journeys for neighbouring schools and community partners.We have seen positive results in participating schools. For example, food waste has been reduced from 18kg to less than 10kg per day in Greendale Primary School, and from 24kg to 18kg per day in Admiralty Primary School. The pilot is expected to last two years. At the end of the pilot, we will evaluate the closed-loop food waste management programme and consider future plans for other schools.My Ministry sees potential for greater use of food waste digesters. They could be deployed in hawker centres and coffee shops as the Member has suggested, or other premises such as shopping malls. However, we recognise that there are economic and practical constraints, such as the cost of the digesters and availability of space. Currently, we are conducting a pilot at Block 628 Ang Mo Kio Ave 4 Market to digest food waste generated by stallholders and patrons on-site. Under the contract for Public Waste Collection in the Pasir Ris – Bedok sector, on-site food waste treatment will be made available at two hawker centres – Block 58 New Upper Changi Road hawker centre and Block 16 Bedok South Road hawker centre. We will deploy food waste digesters at other hawker centres where suitable.We hope to see more businesses implement food waste reduction initiatives and adopt on-site food waste treatment solutions. Businesses interested in installing on-site food waste digesters may also apply to the NEA 3R Fund for support."
passing rate for national physical fitness award/assessment scheme in 2007 and 2016,"Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling asked the Minister for Education (Schools) (a) what is the passing rate for the National Physical Fitness Award/Assessment (NAPFA) Scheme in 2007 and 2016; (b) whether students are adequately prepared in schools for the annual assessment; and (c) for students who are unable to manage the 2.4km walk-run, how do schools assist them in coping within their ability.","Mr Ng Chee Meng: Since the review of the National Physical Fitness Award (NAPFA) scheme in 2014, the NAPFA test has been reframed as an educational tool to teach students the various components of fitness, and how these contribute to active and healthy living. The frequency of the NAPFA test for students has correspondingly been revised from an annual test to alternate year testing from Primary 4 onwards.Fitness training is therefore integrated into all physical activities within the Physical Education (PE) curriculum. Specific knowledge and skills on training for fitness are imparted as part of the Physical Health and Fitness component.Aligned with this, schools teach students how they could train for fitness, including for the 2.4km Run-Walk by building from low intensity training and progressing gradually towards the actual NAPFA test. Students are also taught to set personal targets appropriate to their individual ability, with the focus on self-improvement rather than passing the NAPFA test.The reduced emphasis on the NAPFA test and test frequency allows students to use the freed-up time for more diverse physical activities. It also encourages them to enjoy physical activities and sports during PE lessons, and develop life-long habits for sustaining health and fitness. As NAPFA test is meant as an educational tool, and not as a national fitness index for students, there is no basis for comparing NAPFA test passing rates nationally over time."
highest level of mainstream education attained by high-functioning intellectually-disabled children,"Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Education (Schools) (a) to date, what is the highest level of mainstream education attained by high-functioning intellectually disabled children; and (b) what is the support given to assist high-functioning intellectually disabled children to remain in mainstream schools.","Mr Ng Chee Meng: ""High-functioning intellectually disabled"" children would be referring to those with mild intellectual disability. Students with Intellectual Disability usually show significant limitations in cognitive and daily living skills, as expressed in conceptual, social and practical adaptive functions. They may also have emotional and motivational problems arising from persistent difficulties in learning.Typically, the needs of students with intellectual disability are best served in the Special Education (SPED) schools as they have customised programmes where these students are taught by specially trained teachers who can cater to their specific learning needs and supported by allied professionals such as allied health, paramedical, social and psychological support and post-school transition support.These schools also offer a customised curriculum with a vocational education programme to equip students with independent living and workplace readiness skills. Some of these students eventually attain vocational certification and/or progress to ITE.There are two SPED schools offering vocational certification programmes for students with mild intellectual disability – APSN Delta Senior School and Metta School which offers the Workforce Skills Qualifications and the ITE Skills Certificate, respectively. Generally, the students are able to be gainfully employed upon obtaining their vocational certification."
"annual infographic on usage of national manpower, training and upgrading schemes","Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) whether the Ministry will consider issuing an infographic annually to update individuals and companies of their usage of national manpower, training and upgrading schemes and subsidies such as those under Adapt and Grow and SkillsFuture.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: Agencies such as SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) and Workforce Singapore (WSG) actively promote their schemes and programmes to encourage take up. They do so with the help of industry associations and unions. We also encourage employers to invest in the workforce, and to build companies' capabilities to invest in human capital development. This is done through programmes such as the SkillsFuture Leadership Development Initiative, and the SkillsFuture SME Mentors programme.Later this year, we will launch the MySkillsFuture portal to empower Singaporeans to chart their own career and learning pathways. Individuals will be able to use MySkillsFuture to regularly check on their usage of their SkillsFuture Credit. We will also be launching the SkillsFuture Advice for Individuals programme to provide advice at the community level on how Singaporeans can benefit from the different SkillsFuture and Adapt and Grow programmes.Given the various outreach efforts, and that the schemes are constantly evolving, we do not plan to issue individualised updates on annual utilisation of such programmes. However, we certainly hope that individuals and companies take an active interest in upgrading themselves, and leverage on various programs and schemes."
number of children below age of four diagnosed with special needs,"Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what is the current percentage of children below the age of four who are diagnosed with special needs; and (b) of these, how many have been diagnosed with intellectual disabilities.","Mr Desmond Lee: Child development programmes in our public healthcare system are provided by KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH) and National University Hospital (NUH). These programmes extend medical diagnosis, assessment and early intervention services to children aged 0 to 6 years old who have developmental needs and behavioural issues. In 2016, 2,170 children under the age of four (or about 1.4% of the cohorts) were diagnosed with varying degrees of developmental issues and needs.It is difficult to make a firm diagnosis of intellectual disability for very young children, except for those with specific genetic conditions, severe autism and severe cerebral palsy that are known to cause intellectual disabilities. Some will grow out of their developmental challenges after early intervention.Early intervention remains a key area of focus for children with developmental needs to maximise their potential. Besides KKH and NUH, early intervention services in the community are provided through MSF-funded Early Intervention Programme for Infants and Children (EIPIC) and Development Support (DS) programme for children with milder needs in preschools."
extension or permanent waiver of application fee for lasting power of attorney form 1,Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) whether the Ministry intends to further extend or permanently waive the application fee for the Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) Form 1 beyond the 31 August 2018 extension; and (b) how many new LPA Form 1 applications have been received by the Office of the Public Guardian since the August 2016 announcement of the extended fee waiver for LPA Form 1 applications for Singaporeans.,"Mr Desmond Lee: More Singaporeans are taking steps to safeguard their future by making a Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA). The LPA empowers a person to appoint someone reliable and trustworthy to act on his behalf should he lose the capacity to make decisions.We first waived the LPA Form 1 application fee from 1 September 2014 to 31 August 2016. We subsequently extended the fee waiver from 1 September 2016 to 31 August 2018. From 1 September 2016 to 31 August 2017, we have received 11,503 unique LPA Form 1 applications.We are currently studying how effective the application fee waiver and other measures have been, so far, in encouraging people to make their LPAs early."
number of comcare applications withdrawn after submission,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) for each year from 2011 to 2016, what is the number of ComCare applicants who have withdrawn their applications after having submitted them; and (b) what is the breakdown of the reasons for their withdrawal.","Mr Desmond Lee: Between 2011 and 2016, the proportion of ComCare applications that were withdrawn after submission averaged about 2% per year.Applicants may withdraw their applications because they subsequently find a job and hence no longer require help. They may also withdraw their applications because they do not want to share the necessary documents or allow us to speak with their family members to better understand their financial situation.Whatever the case, we will always advise the applicants that they can return to the Social Service Office should they change their minds and decide to step forward for assistance in future."
update on review of comprehensive economic cooperation agreement with india,"Mr Chen Show Mao asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Trade) whether he can provide an update on (i) the review of the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) with India and (ii) discussions, if any, with India on the movement of natural persons, including professionals, business visitors, intra-corporate transferees and short-term service providers, under CECA.","Mr Lim Hng Kiang: The Second Review of the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (""Second CECA Review"") is ongoing. The review is taking some time as both countries have our respective interests to work through, such as in the area of labour mobility.Our agencies regularly engage Indian counterparts to work through issues collaboratively. This is with a view to arriving at mutually beneficial outcomes, before the conclusion of the Second CECA Review.To this end, Singaporean and Indian officials have had discussions on a wide range of bilateral economic topics, including CECA and the movement of natural persons. These discussions are useful in promoting better mutual understanding of the rationale behind each party’s policies and policy changes, as well as addressing implementation details that may arise from time to time."
number of mrt train incidents from january to august 2017,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Transport what is the total number of incidents of MRT train or track faults, delays and disruptions (of any length of time) from January to August 2017 and, of this number, how many have been due to the signal integration work being done for the North-South and East-West Lines.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: From January to August 2017, there were a total of 149 MRT delays lasting longer than five minutes. Of these, 90 were due to the installation of the new signalling system on the North-South Line and Tuas West Extension. Such delays are temporary in nature, and as the new system stabilises, will fall in occurrence. The number of such delays peaked at 27 in June and has dropped to seven in August. The declining trend continues. However, testing on the East-West Line has not yet begun. We seek commuters' continued support and patience during this period."
number of children below age of four diagnosed with special needs,"Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what is the current percentage of children below the age of four who are diagnosed with special needs; and (b) of these, how many have been diagnosed with intellectual disabilities.","Mr Desmond Lee: Child development programmes in our public healthcare system are provided by KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH) and National University Hospital (NUH). These programmes extend medical diagnosis, assessment and early intervention services to children aged 0 to 6 years old who have developmental needs and behavioural issues. In 2016, 2,170 children under the age of four (or about 1.4% of the cohorts) were diagnosed with varying degrees of developmental issues and needs.It is difficult to make a firm diagnosis of intellectual disability for very young children, except for those with specific genetic conditions, severe autism and severe cerebral palsy that are known to cause intellectual disabilities. Some will grow out of their developmental challenges after early intervention.Early intervention remains a key area of focus for children with developmental needs to maximise their potential. Besides KKH and NUH, early intervention services in the community are provided through MSF-funded Early Intervention Programme for Infants and Children (EIPIC) and Development Support (DS) programme for children with milder needs in preschools."
extension or permanent waiver of application fee for lasting power of attorney form 1,Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) whether the Ministry intends to further extend or permanently waive the application fee for the Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) Form 1 beyond the 31 August 2018 extension; and (b) how many new LPA Form 1 applications have been received by the Office of the Public Guardian since the August 2016 announcement of the extended fee waiver for LPA Form 1 applications for Singaporeans.,"Mr Desmond Lee: More Singaporeans are taking steps to safeguard their future by making a Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA). The LPA empowers a person to appoint someone reliable and trustworthy to act on his behalf should he lose the capacity to make decisions.We first waived the LPA Form 1 application fee from 1 September 2014 to 31 August 2016. We subsequently extended the fee waiver from 1 September 2016 to 31 August 2018. From 1 September 2016 to 31 August 2017, we have received 11,503 unique LPA Form 1 applications.We are currently studying how effective the application fee waiver and other measures have been, so far, in encouraging people to make their LPAs early."
number of comcare applications withdrawn after submission,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) for each year from 2011 to 2016, what is the number of ComCare applicants who have withdrawn their applications after having submitted them; and (b) what is the breakdown of the reasons for their withdrawal.","Mr Desmond Lee: Between 2011 and 2016, the proportion of ComCare applications that were withdrawn after submission averaged about 2% per year.Applicants may withdraw their applications because they subsequently find a job and hence no longer require help. They may also withdraw their applications because they do not want to share the necessary documents or allow us to speak with their family members to better understand their financial situation.Whatever the case, we will always advise the applicants that they can return to the Social Service Office should they change their minds and decide to step forward for assistance in future."
statistics of successful citizenship application from 2012 to 2016,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Home Affairs in each of the last five years, how many PRs and non-PRs were successful in their application for citizenship respectively, broken down by age group.","Mr K Shanmugam: In the past five years, about 20,900 individuals were granted Singapore Citizenship (SC) annually. More than half of them were aged 30 years and below when they were granted SC. About 85% were Permanent Residents (PRs) when they were granted SC. The others were children of Singapore citizens born overseas who subsequently registered for SC, as well as the minor children of successful SC applicants. Under the Constitution, minors do not need to obtain PR status first in order to be eligible for citizenship."
number of work-related traffic accidents involving food delivery and courier service staff from 2015 to 2017,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the number of work-related traffic accidents involving food delivery and courier service staff in the past three years; and (b) what are the measures taken by the Ministry to reduce the number of such accidents.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: From 2014 to 2016, there were six work-related traffic accidents that resulted in death, and 12 cases that resulted in serious injury, involving food delivery and courier services riders/drivers.With the growth of delivery services, MOM is collaborating with the WSH Council, tripartite partners, Traffic Police and the Land Transport Authority to step up our engagement efforts with companies and riders/drivers.To spread safety awareness among riders, the Singapore Ride Safe Campaign was launched on 19 August 2017. It sought to inculcate safe riding habits such as avoiding blind spots, keeping within speed limits, and wearing proper protective gear.To improve safety practices for companies, WSH Council has initiated regular engagement sessions to share best practices. These include providing proper protective gear for delivery riders/drivers, sending them for advanced training such as defensive driving or riding courses, conducting in-house safety training, and installing vehicle/helmet-mounted cameras for greater safety consciousness.For both riders/drivers and companies, the WSH Council, in collaboration with key industry partners and unions, has also developed educational resources including videos and guides on safe driving tips. These are made available on the WSH Council website. WSH Council will also develop a guide on safe motorcycle, bicycle and PMD riding by the end of the year. It will contain advice on road traffic rules, hazard avoidance, and safety checklists.At the same time, we have stepped up enforcement efforts. Since July, MOM has targeted 50 food delivery and courier services companies for inspection. This will be completed by September. The inspections will focus on companies' measures related to training, fatigue management, and risk management to improve the safety of delivery riders/drivers.All these measures seek to improve workplace safety for delivery riders/drivers. We are also looking into helping self-employed delivery persons get adequate insurance coverage. A Tripartite Workgroup has been formed to look into this matter as well as address other main concerns of self-employed persons. This was announced by the Ministry in its Committee of Supply debate this year."
moneylenders recovering fees and interests above principal sum,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Law (a) how many moneylenders have been taken to task for recovering fees and interests above the principal sum; (b) how does the Ministry prevent moneylenders from giving out short-term loans in the guise of charging administrative fees; and (c) how can the Ministry improve the public awareness on the rules governing moneylenders.,"Mr K Shanmugam: In October 2015, the Registry of Moneylenders (""the Registry"") under the Ministry of Law implemented new controls on licensed moneylenders to better protect borrowers. The new controls included a cap on the total cost of borrowing to 100% of the loan's principal sum, which helps to ensure that fees and interest do not spiral out of control. To date, no licensed moneylender has been found to have breached this rule.Last year, the Registry received complaints and observed that some licensed moneylenders were making repeated short-term loans of less than one month and split loans. The former allowed them to charge the administrative fee several times in a month whenever an initial loan was renewed, even when no new funds had been disbursed. The latter meant that multiple late payment fees could be incurred when a single loan was split into multiple smaller loans.In response, MinLaw issued the Registrar's Directions (""RD"") No. 1 of 2016, which prohibits licensed moneylenders from offering short term loans or split loans to borrowers who are unable to keep up with repayment plans. The Registry also issued RD 1 of 2017 which prohibits moneylenders from repeatedly ""rolling over"" existing loans and re-charging the administrative fee, when a borrower is unable to pay an instalment.The Registry will continue to monitor the industry closely, to eliminate abusive practices intended to circumvent the Moneylenders Act and the Moneylenders Rules 2009 (""the Rules""). It will issue new RDs when necessary. The Registry also conducts regular inspections at licensed moneylending premises, and investigates potential breaches of the Moneylenders Act, the Rules, and the RDs. Errant licensed moneylenders will be taken to task.To raise public awareness on the rules governing moneylenders, MinLaw has been issuing media releases with infographics on the moneylending rules and the RDs. MinLaw has also been working closely with the Moneylender's Association of Singapore to educate borrowers. In addition, under the Moneylenders Act and Rules, MinLaw requires licensed moneylenders to inform borrowers of the loan terms and conditions such as the interest rate and fees of each loan granted. The RDs also require moneylenders to provide a cautionary statement in writing to borrowers before granting any short-term loans or split loans, or ""rolling over"" loans to refinance existing debts."
measures to reduce risk of fires in cooked food centres,Mr Chen Show Mao asked the Minister for Home Affairs what measures are in place to reduce the risk of fires taking place at hawker stalls at cooked food centres.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The Fire Code stipulates that hawker centres need to have hose reels and fire extinguishers, and adequate, unimpeded access to facilitate escape in the event of a fire. There are also regulations on the use of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking, and cleaning requirements for kitchen exhaust ducts.Some common causes of fires at hawker centres are the accumulation of grease within poorly-maintained kitchen exhaust ducts which ignite during the cooking process, stallholders leaving their cooking unattended, and forgetting to switch off appliances at the end of the day.A large number of such fires can be prevented. As part of its Community Emergency Preparedness Programme, SCDF partners NEA to educate stallholders on how to prevent and respond to fire emergencies. SCDF has also implemented mitigating measures to reduce the risk of fires in hawker centres. For instance, SCDF, with HDB and the Town Councils, have worked together to replace all individual LPG cylinders in hawker centres with safer centralised LPG pipeline manifold systems or Town Gas.Hawker centre owners and stallholders have a big part to play. They can prevent fires by thoroughly cleaning their kitchen exhaust ducts at least once a year, not leaving cooking unattended, and switching off all appliances when they leave for the day."
steps to improve take-up rate of sgsecure mobile app,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Defence (a) what is being done to improve the take-up rate of the SGSecure mobile app apart from making it compulsory for full-time national servicemen (NSFs) to download it; (b) why are websites not used for the e-learning modules instead of an app; and (c) whether the Ministry will re-examine its policy for ensuring that NSFs download the app.,"Dr Ng Eng Hen: As the Member has suggested, the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) is indeed utilising e-learning including through websites to better equip all MINDEF and SAF personnel, including NS men for training in counter -terrorism. The e-learning training programme is structured to be comprehensive with a number of modules to be rolled out progressively. E-learning modules will gain wide acceptance if they are functional, useful and easy to use. Making it compulsory is neither an enlightened approach nor effective to facilitate learning.The SG secure application is not a core part of the SAF's counter-terrorism training package nor compulsory for NS men to download. However, in support of MHA's nation-wide efforts against terrorism, MINDEF and SAF personnel are encouraged to download the SGSecure application so that like other residents, they can receive important alerts or provide information to the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) authorities during major emergencies."
enhanced immigration automated clearance system fingerprint detection failure rate,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Home Affairs in respect of the enhanced Immigration Automated Clearance System (a) what is the failure rate of fingerprint detection; and (b) whether measures can be implemented to assist travellers with dry fingers such as placing bottles of moisturiser near the scanners.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The enhanced Immigration Automated Clearance System (eIACS) allows Singapore Citizens, Singapore Permanent Residents, Long Term Pass Holders and other eligible users with machine-readable passports, and whose fingerprints have been pre-enrolled with the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) to clear immigration via the automated gates.However, travellers with faded, scarred, or excessively wet or dry fingerprints may face difficulties using the eIACS. On average, such cases amounted to about 3% of all travellers who used the eIACS. These travellers are referred to the manned counters for immigration clearance.ICA plans to introduce iris scan technology progressively at our checkpoints over the next two years. Travellers who face difficulties with fingerprint matching will be able to use iris scan when they clear immigration via the automated gates. Iris scan technology will complement the current fingerprint matching process for automated immigration clearance, and provides an additional avenue for ICA to verify a traveller's identity."
'change of employer' option granted to work permit holders from january to june 2017,"Mr Kok Heng Leun asked the Minister for Manpower in the first six months of 2017, how many work permit holders (excluding foreign domestic helpers) have been granted the option of 'change of employer' by the Ministry and, of these, how many have found new jobs with new work permits issued without first going home.","Mr Lim Swee Say: All foreign workers with valid salary claims are allowed to change employers. In the first six months of 2017, about 600 of such foreign workers indicated that they wished to change employers. Of these, about half found new jobs in Singapore. MOM does not track if the workers went home in between jobs."
singapore citizenship of late mr tan lark sye,"Mr Low Thia Khiang asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether the Singapore citizenship of the late Mr Tan Lark Sye was reinstated after it was revoked; (b) if so, what were the years in which his citizenship was revoked and reinstated; and (c) what are the reasons for the revocation and reinstatement.","Mr K Shanmugam: The late Mr Tan Lark Sye was deprived of his Singapore citizenship in 1964. He had engaged in activities prejudicial to the security and public order of Malaya and Singapore, in particular, in advancing the Communist cause. There has been no change in his Singapore citizenship status since then."
number of singapore foreign spouses granted pr and citizenship in 2016,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Home Affairs how many foreign spouses of Singaporeans have been granted PR and citizenship respectively in 2016.,"Mr K Shanmugam: Foreign spouses married to Singapore Citizens (SCs) may be granted Permanent Residence (PR), and subsequently Singapore Citizenship (SC), under the Family Ties Scheme (FTS).In 2016, around 4,600 and 3,400 foreign spouses of SCs were granted PR and SC respectively."
number of singaporeans without active singpass account,"Dr Tan Wu Meng asked the Prime Minister with regard to the Smart Nation initiative (a) what is the number of Singaporeans who do not have an active SingPass account, broken down by age group; and (b) what is the number of Singaporeans with an active SingPass account who (i) have not yet enabled 2-Factor Authentication (2FA) or (ii) have not used 2FA in the past one year, broken down by age group.","Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): All Singapore Residents (Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents) who are 15 years old and above are eligible to sign up for SingPass.Out of 3.5 million Singapore Residents who are eligible for SingPass, 3.2 million have signed up for SingPass. Two million of these account holders are inactive, i.e. have not used their SingPass for the last three years. Of the 3 million active account holders, 2.6 million have enabled 2-Factor Authentication (2FA), and most of them (2.5 million) have used 2FA in the past one year.As the breakdown at Table 1 below shows, adoption of SingPass and 2FA are lower among the young and the elderly groups. One contributing reason is that both these groups have fewer transactions with the Government.Residents who have yet to sign up for a SingPass account can do so at the 46 SingPass counters islandwide, located at community centres and CPF service centres."
breakdown on cases of illegal parking or misuses of taxi stands from 2015 to 2017,"Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the breakdown in the number of cases of illegal parking or misuse of taxi stands by taxis and private hire vehicles in 2015, 2016 and first half of 2017; and (b) what will the Ministry do to further deter such behaviour.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The number of notices issued to taxis and private hire cars for illegal parking and stopping at taxi stands and taxi stops in 2015, 2016 and first half of 2017 are as follows:LTA will continue to deploy enforcement officers and CCTVs to deter misuse of taxi stands and taxi stops."
number of singaporeans without bank account,"Ms Tin Pei Ling asked the Prime Minister (a) what is the number of Singaporeans who do not have a bank account, broken down by age group; and (b) what is the number of Singaporeans who do not have ATM, debit or credit cards, broken down by age group.","Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): A high proportion of Singaporeans have bank accounts. While we do not have the exact numbers, based on the 2014 World Bank Global Findex survey, 96% of Singapore residents above the age of 15 have bank accounts. The figure would be higher for adults. Another source of information comes from the GST Voucher Scheme. About 40,000 Singaporeans have encashed the cheques they receive under the scheme, which could be because they do not have bank accounts.About 80% of local banks' customers hold either an ATM, debit or credit card. Within this group, more than 90% of customers aged between 16 and 59 hold a card; for customers aged 60 and above, the percentage is 70%. Those who are under the age of 16 generally do not hold cards. This is not surprising, given that child accounts are normally set up to accumulate savings and not for transactional purposes. Parents can, however, apply for ATM or debit cards for their children, and set the appropriate withdrawal and spending limits for their children.To ensure that Singaporeans have access to affordable and convenient basic banking services, major retail banks in Singapore already offer Basic Banking Accounts and these have been available since 2002. Such accounts, which generally come with ATM/debit card and Internet banking services, can be maintained at very low cost. In fact, some banks provide the service free for school-going children and the elderly by waiving the account service fees.MAS is also working with the industry and retail merchants to develop and promote new electronic payment options that are widely accepted and convenient to use, and which may not require the user to have a bank account or bank card. These include electronic wallets that can be downloaded to everyone's mobile phones easily, and wearable devices that operate similarly like wallets and can be topped up by family members conveniently. An example is the POSB Smart Buddy, which is a watch that children can use to buy food at school canteens. A similar device can be developed and customised for use by the elderly.We will continue to monitor accessibility to banking and payment services, and work with the industry to ensure that Singaporeans' needs can be most conveniently met."
regulations to prevent import of motor vehicles with known defects into singapore,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for Transport whether there are regulations in place to prevent the import of motor vehicles into Singapore that have known defects or have been subject to a manufacturer's recall.,"6 Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for Transport (a) when was the LTA notified and made aware about the manufacturer's recall and rectification of Honda Vezel vehicles owned by Uber in Singapore; (b) what were the actions taken in this case; (c) how does LTA ensure that all imported vehicles are safe especially when they are used as vehicles for hire and reward; and (d) what actions will be taken against corporate entities or individuals who knowingly violate safety measures or ignore safety concerns.Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Importers and dealers must provide documentary proof that their motor vehicles meet international vehicle safety standards before the motor vehicles can be registered for use in Singapore. Should defects be uncovered after registration, they are required to notify LTA, affected vehicle owners and prospective buyers of the defects and also arrange to recall and repair the vehicles. Vehicle owners must also produce their vehicles for rectification after receiving recall notices from their importers or dealers, after which it is the duty of importers and dealers to verify that the rectifications have been done in accordance with the manufacturers’ specifications and update LTA on the rectification progress. Importers and dealers who do not comply with the vehicle recall regulations will be fined up to $2,000 for each vehicle, subject to a maximum fine of $50,000.In April 2016, LTA was informed of Honda Japan's recall of their Honda Vezel cars, some of which are owned by Lion City Rental (LCR), a subsidiary of Uber. LTA immediately informed all importers and dealers of affected vehicles to recall the vehicles for rectification. LTA also requested the Automobile Importer & Exporter Association (AIEA) and Singapore Vehicle Traders Association (SVTA) to remind their members to begin recalling affected Honda Vezel cars for rectification.Out of the 113 importers and dealers who sold affected Honda Vezels, 89 have notified their customers of the recall and started rectifying the vehicles. Of the remaining 24 importers and dealers who have not done so, LTA has taken legal action against three and is investigating the rest. As of 4 September 2017, 42% of all affected Honda Vezels have been rectified."
effectiveness of oneinbox,Mr Leon Perera asked the Prime Minister (a) what is the total amount of public funds spent on developing and maintaining OneInbox; (b) how many people signed up for OneInbox as at 31 March 2017; (c) what are the main reasons for the low take-up rate; and (d) whether the Government plans to develop a new system to replace paper notices sent to citizens.,"Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): OneInbox was in operation from December 2013 to June 2017. It offered free digital mailbox services for citizens to receive Government correspondences electronically.The total development and maintenance cost of OneInbox was approximately $7 million.OneInbox was discontinued due to the low take-up rate. This was despite several publicity campaigns to increase awareness and adoption among citizens. As at end of March 2017, OneInbox had a total of 51,807 subscribers and delivered 296,418 digital letters. These subscribers made up less than 2% of SingPass users.OneInbox had low take-up rate because it did not offer significant value to the subscribers. Firstly, OneInbox was designed as a single-function digital mailbox service, which did not encourage sign-ups. Secondly, agencies already have well developed digital channels to serve the public, hence reducing the need for an overall Government channel. Thirdly, the traffic volume of digital letters was not high, whereby a typical individual receives less than 10 letters from the Government annually.In being innovative in exploiting technology, we would not always succeed in all that we do. We have to take risks. As part of our digital Government drive, we will continue to review and adjust our strategies and make it easier for citizens to use Government services."
traffic accidents involving drivers of private hire vehicles in 2016,"Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Transport (a) over the last one year, what has been the number of traffic incidents involving drivers of private hire vehicles; and (b) how is the Ministry working with operators of private hire vehicles to help such drivers drive and operate safely.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: From 1 July 2016 to 30 June 2017, there were 1,139 accidents involving private hire cars.Private hire car drivers are required to obtain a Private Hire Car Driver's Vocational Licence (PDVL). To do so, applicants must attend and pass the PDVL course, which has modules on safe driving. PDVL holders will also be given demerit points for unsafe conduct. LTA will continue to work closely with the National Private Hire Vehicles' Association and private hire car service operators to promote safe driving."
impact of ride hailing apps on taxis,"Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the increasing number of taxis relying on ride hailing apps, including platforms provided by Uber and Grab, have significantly reduced the number of taxis available for street hire or at taxi stands, thereby restricting commuters' choices; and (b) if so, whether LTA has any plans to regulate this.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Ride hailing apps increase the range of options for commuters in hailing a taxi. Based on commuters' satisfaction with taxi services (surveyed by the Public Transport Council) and waiting times at taxi stands, both of which have improved in the last year, there is no evidence to suggest that the number of taxis available for street hire or at taxi stands is insufficient to meet current demand."
rate of uptake of parent-care leave in public and private sectors from 2014 to 2016,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Prime Minister (a) what is the rate of uptake of parent-care leave by public servants for each year in the past three years; and (b) what is the number of private companies that currently offer parent-care leave.,"Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): Civil servants can take up to two days of parent-care leave a year. In the past three years, 39% (2014), 40% (2015), and 42% (2016) of civil servants took parent-care leave.Parent-care leave is not legislated. Based on a Ministry of Manpower survey in 2016, only 19% of employers offer parent-care leave."
lift construction at braddell road overhead bridge,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for Transport whether LTA can consider constructing a lift at the overhead bridge at Braddell Road (near Blk 219 Toa Payoh Lorong 8) in order to facilitate the many elderly residents who use the overhead bridge on a daily basis.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: LTA is studying the request, to check if the site conditions are suitable and whether it meets the criteria for installing lifts to an overhead bridge."
update on sungei road flea market vendors,"Mr Kok Heng Leun asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether he can provide an update on the number of Sungei Road flea market vendors who have received assistance from the Government or have moved into new stalls to date; (b) how many of the vendors who have been allocated new stalls are still in business; and (c) for those who have stopped operating at these new stalls, what are the reasons for the closure of the stalls.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Prior to the closure of the Sungei Road Hawking Zone (SRHZ) on 10 July 2017, the National Environment Agency (NEA), Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), Workforce Singapore (WSG) and the Central Singapore Community Development Council (CSCDC) had engaged about 200 SRHZ users to offer them assistance so that they can either continue their trade at alternative venues or make a living through other means. To date, close to 80 SRHZ users are now receiving some form of assistance even as they make the necessary adjustments.At the Parliament sitting on 3 July 2017, my Ministry shared that the NEA has set aside more than 40 lock-up stalls at our hawker centres for the SRHZ users who wished to carry on their trade. To date, more than 30 SRHZ users have taken up and commenced business at these lock-up stalls. To help them transit and succeed in their new environment, the NEA has provided rental subsidies and facilitated their participation in a course to teach them merchandise display skills and explore a new range of items for sale. The NEA has also helped to raise the awareness of the location of their stalls through banners, signage and social media posts.For the 11 original permit holders, the NEA has offered them lock-up stalls at our hawker centres at subsidised rental with a full rental waiver for the first year and 50% subsidy off the subsidised rental for the second year. Of the 11 original permit holders, four have taken up the offer to operate a lock-up stall at our hawker centres.So far, of all the users who have taken up stalls from the NEA, only one has changed his mind and decided to give up his lock-up stall as he felt that his merchandise might be unsuitable for sale in a hawker centre.In addition, the NEA has also worked with the People’s Association (PA) and the CSCDC to assist SRHZ users who wish to operate in flea markets. So far, 27 SRHZ users have taken up stalls at existing flea markets around Singapore.Besides the provision of lock-up stalls at our hawker centres and flea markets, the WSG has provided job placement assistance to SRHZ users who wish to seek employment. The MSF and the CSCDC have also actively helped those who require financial assistance through the ComCare and other schemes. So far, 28 SRHZ users have received either financial or job placement assistance.The Government will continue to keep in contact with those SRHZ users who require assistance but have yet to accept our offers. Meanwhile, we are glad to know that a number of the SRHZ users have already started to operate stalls at trade fairs organised by private operators and that others have ventured into sales through online platforms. We hope the Member and the community will continue to lend their support to the SRHZ users at our lock-up stalls, flea markets, trade fairs or online platforms."
factors influencing rental cost of hawker stalls,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what are the factors that influence the rental cost of hawker stalls; (b) aside from the tender amount, what other criteria determine the success of a tender applicant; (c) what is being done to keep monthly rentals of hawker stalls more affordable; and (d) why do Yishun Park Hawker Centre tenderers have to pay at least twice the average bid to get a stall.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The Government lets out hawker stalls to interested Singaporeans and Permanent Residents through open tenders. A hawker stall is awarded based on the bid amount and the proposed food to be sold which, in turn, has to comply with the designated trade for that stall as indicated in the tender notice. For example, if a cooked food stall is designated as a ""Halal Cooked Food"" stall, a bidder who proposes to sell drinks would not be successful, regardless of the bid amount.The amount that an applicant bids for a hawker stall would likely be influenced by factors such as the location and condition of the hawker centre, stall size, the applicant’s assessment of the potential business volume of the stall as well as previous successful bid amounts at the hawker centre.To moderate stall rents, we have introduced key policy changes since 2012, such as disallowing stall assignment and subletting to prevent stall owners who have no intention of operating the stalls themselves from engaging in rent seeking behaviour. In addition, we removed the concept of reserve rent to allow the rentals to fully reflect the market demand for the stalls. Since the removal of the reserve rent in 2012, about 53% of the tendered cooked food stalls were awarded at below what the reserve rent would have been. On the whole, more than 85% of our hawkers pay less than $1,500 per month in stall rent. This is generally lower than stall rents in coffee shops or food courts in comparable locations.The Yishun Park Hawker Centre is a new hawker centre which will be managed by the Timbre+ Hawkers Pte Ltd on a not-for-profit basis. The managing agent was selected following the evaluation of the proposals received for the management of this centre. The evaluation was based on a matrix of price and qualitative criteria to deliver value to both patrons and hawkers. Among the qualitative evaluation criteria are the costs that potential stall-holders will pay as well as the ideas to keep food prices affordable and the productivity measures to help the stall holders manage their manpower costs.The rents of the Yishun Park Hawker Centre are also comparable to other new hawker centres. Timbre will select the stall-holders based on a set of evaluation criteria, which are the stall applicant's food type, the food taste and quality, the price of the food and their online presence.The Government will continue to work closely with Timbre to ensure that the Yishun Park Hawker Centre meets the needs of the residents in providing affordable and hygienic food."
employment agencies industry averages for foreign domestic worker retention and transfer rates from 2015 to 2017,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Manpower (a) for each year over the past three years, what are the employment agencies industry averages for the foreign domestic worker (FDW) retention rate and transfer rate respectively; (b) what steps is the Ministry taking to improve these rates; and (c) whether it will require employment agencies to prominently display their FDW retention rate and transfer rate at their premises.","Mr Lim Swee Say: The average retention rate for foreign domestic workers (FDWs) placed by employment agencies (EAs) has been stable for the last three years at around 50%, an improvement from about 40% in 2013. The average FDW transfer rate has been low, below 1.5% since 2013.The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has been taking steps to improve the professionalism and service standards of the EA industry. Since last year, employers' ratings of EAs' services have been systematically captured by the EA Customer Rating System. EAs are thus incentivised to ensure better matching between FDWs and prospective employers to improve the retention and transfer rates.The customer ratings of EAs are made available online on MOM's website under the EA Directory. Together with other information such as placement volume, retention and transfer rates, the EA Directory helps employers make an informed choice on which EA to engage. The EA Directory is updated weekly and enables employers to make comparisons. As it is working well, we have no plans to require EAs to physically display such information at their premises.We also introduced the Advanced Placement Scheme (APS) pilot in August last year. Under the scheme, employers with caregiving needs are able to interview prospective FDWs face to face. Feedback has been positive as the face to face interviews have helped both parties better understand each other's needs and expectations. The majority of FDWs placed under APS are still with their first employer."
update on review of comprehensive economic cooperation agreement with india,"Mr Chen Show Mao asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Trade) whether he can provide an update on (i) the review of the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) with India and (ii) discussions, if any, with India on the movement of natural persons, including professionals, business visitors, intra-corporate transferees and short-term service providers, under CECA.","Mr Lim Hng Kiang: The Second Review of the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (""Second CECA Review"") is ongoing. The review is taking some time as both countries have our respective interests to work through, such as in the area of labour mobility.Our agencies regularly engage Indian counterparts to work through issues collaboratively. This is with a view to arriving at mutually beneficial outcomes, before the conclusion of the Second CECA Review.To this end, Singaporean and Indian officials have had discussions on a wide range of bilateral economic topics, including CECA and the movement of natural persons. These discussions are useful in promoting better mutual understanding of the rationale behind each party’s policies and policy changes, as well as addressing implementation details that may arise from time to time."
percentage of cpf members who have nominated their beneficiaries,Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked the Minister for Manpower what is the current percentage of CPF members who have nominated their beneficiaries and whether members are made aware of the list of fees charged by the Public Trustee for the administration of un-nominated monies.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: As of end December 2016, about half of all CPF members aged 16 and above have made a nomination for their CPF savings.When a CPF member passes away without making a nomination, his CPF savings will be transferred to the Public Trustee's Office (PTO) for distribution according to intestacy laws. The PTO charges an administration fee for this distribution of members' CPF savings and publishes the fee schedule on their website.CPF Board informs members of PTO’s administration fee and encourages them to make a nomination for their CPF savings through efforts such as including customised messages in members' Yearly Statement of Accounts as well as educating them on the nomination scheme through CPF Board's social media channels, talks, roadshows and website. The Board also prompts members with no valid nomination to make one when they attend the CPF Retirement Planning Service at age 54."
exclusion of overtime pay in workfare income supplement computation of monthly salary,"Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Ministry will exclude overtime pay in the computation of monthly salary to qualify for the Workfare Income Supplement as workers' overtime allowances are irregular and may disincentivise workers with gross monthly income near the $2,000 cut-off mark not to take up overtime work.","Mr Lim Swee Say: The Government had considered using basic pay (ie, excluding overtime pay and bonuses) in the computation of income for the purposes of the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) Scheme, but decided not to pursue it because basic salary, overtime pay and bonuses are part of a worker's total income that will help support the worker and his or her family. Given that WIS is intended to help low-wage workers by supplementing their income, it is fair to look at the total income in assessing the level of support provided through WIS. This will also not incentivise employers and workers to reduce basic pay and increase overtime which would not be in the workers' interest."
number of mrt train incidents from january to august 2017,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Transport what is the total number of incidents of MRT train or track faults, delays and disruptions (of any length of time) from January to August 2017 and, of this number, how many have been due to the signal integration work being done for the North-South and East-West Lines.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: From January to August 2017, there were a total of 149 MRT delays lasting longer than five minutes. Of these, 90 were due to the installation of the new signalling system on the North-South Line and Tuas West Extension. Such delays are temporary in nature, and as the new system stabilises, will fall in occurrence. The number of such delays peaked at 27 in June and has dropped to seven in August. The declining trend continues. However, testing on the East-West Line has not yet begun. We seek commuters' continued support and patience during this period."
extension of foreign domestic worker levy concession to persons/siblings with major illnesses or medical conditions,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Minister for Manpower whether the foreign domestic worker levy concession can be extended to persons with major illnesses or medical conditions and their ill siblings.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: The concession is already available today. Households with the following family members will be eligible for a foreign domestic worker levy concession:a) Elderly aged 65 and above;b) Children below the age of 16; orc) Persons certified by authorised healthcare professionals to require assistance with at least one Activity of Daily Living (ADL). Examples of ADL include showering, dressing, feeding or toileting."
moneylending to work permit holders,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked the Minister for Manpower whether work permit holders are legally allowed to borrow money from licensed and unlicensed moneylenders.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: Our law does not prohibit members of the public, including work permit holders, from borrowing from licensed moneylenders.However, under the Moneylenders Act, it is illegal for moneylenders to operate without a license. For their protection, all members of the public, including work permit holders, should not borrow money from unlicensed moneylenders.The Singapore Police Force (SPF) takes strong enforcement actions against unlicensed moneylenders such as loansharks. If convicted, an individual who acts as an unlicensed moneylender can be sentenced to a fine of up to $300,000, seven years imprisonment, and 12 strokes of the cane."
rail operators' compliance with lta's operating performance standards on service quality,Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Transport (a) how does LTA independently ensure the rail operators' compliance with LTA's operating performance standards dealing with service quality; and (b) how does LTA handle train commuters' complaints on service quality issues.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Rail operators are required to adhere to the Operating Performance Standards (OPS) imposed by LTA as part of their licensing conditions. This covers areas such as safety, reliability and service quality (eg, train headways, punctuality, and frequency of delays).LTA assesses the quality of service through regular checks of the stations and trains, special audits of the processes and commuter feedback. All feedback is taken seriously and conveyed to the rail operators for improvement."
extension of additional 50% rebate and surcharge for taxis under vehicle emissions scheme to private hire cars,Mr Yee Chia Hsing asked the Minister for Transport whether the additional 50% rebate and surcharge applicable for taxis under the new Vehicle Emissions Scheme that is effective from 1 January 2018 will be applied to private hire cars since these cars have similar high mileages as taxis.,Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The additional 50% Vehicle Emissions Scheme (VES) rebate and surcharge applicable to taxis will not be applied to private hire cars. This is because private hire cars generally have much lower mileages compared to taxis.
common health problems detected during general health screening for children,"Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Health with regard to the general health screenings for children including those conducted in schools (a) which are the more common health problems detected; (b) whether the Ministry keeps track of subsequent intervention and outcomes; (c) how often does the Ministry review and update the lists of tests; and (d) whether the Ministry will consider including more tests and detailed examinations such as blood tests, ECG and mental health tests to detect health problems and abnormalities.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Singapore operates a comprehensive screening system for children, starting from when they are very young. New-born babies are screened for congenital conditions including Glucose-6 Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, hearing impairment, hypothyroidism, and metabolic disorders in which the body cannot properly turn food into energy. In addition, developmental screening is also carried out from birth, to detect any disability even amongst apparently healthy children. Such screening is conducted at hospitals, polyclinics, by family doctors as well as private paediatric specialists. Children suspected to have developmental disabilities such as autism spectrum disorder, are referred to the Child Development Units for further assessment and intervention, if necessary.In the schools, the Health Promotion Board (HPB)'s School Health Service conducts oral and physical health screening, including vision screening, screening for hearing impairment, growth and developmental assessment. The most common medical conditions picked-up from health screening in the schools are myopia, obesity and scoliosis. Students who need specialist care or further assessment are referred to the Specialist Clinics at the Student Health Centre or to restructured hospitals.School teachers are trained to identify students who show signs of emotional distress and provide them with the needed support or refer them to school counsellors for help. In addition, the Response, Early Intervention and Assessment in Community Mental Health (REACH) teams work closely with schools, and train the school counsellors to identify students with mental health needs. Peer support is also encouraged and students are taught to look out for their peers, and seek help from trusted adults around them, such as their school counsellors.MOH regularly reviews the screening tests and preventive health programmes, taking into consideration the local context and scientific developments. HPB's screening programmes are reviewed every three to five years, and the last review was done in 2015."
psychiatric expert evidence found unreliable in criminal trials,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan asked the Minister for Law in each year since 2011 (a) what is the number of cases in which psychiatric expert evidence has been found to be unreliable in criminal trials; and (b) whether this number is impacted by standards established by the relevant professional accreditation body.,"Mr K Shanmugam: In a case where psychiatric expert evidence is adduced, the judge may accept or reject it for various reasons. The same goes for any other expert evidence (and indeed any other evidence which is tendered in court). Not all of these instances and reasons may be recorded in written judgments. The most common reason for rejecting such evidence is that the judge did not accept the expert’s evidence in the light of the specific factual context of the case. This could be because of other evidence adduced, or because a different expert's opinion was more convincing when applied to the facts and the existing state of medical knowledge, or some combination of similar factors.The precise reasons for rejecting psychiatric expert evidence on purely factual grounds thus depends on the factual context of each particular case. They do not necessarily imply any fault on the part of the expert. For this reason, the number of such rejections are not necessarily related to the professional standards governing psychiatrists.There have been cases where the courts have said that they rejected an expert's opinion because he or she failed to meet the minimum standards and objectivity expected of an expert witness. For example, in the case of Mehra Radhika v Public Prosecutor [2015] 1 SLR 96, the Chief Justice observed that the expert psychiatric evidence adduced in that case was ""patently lacking in objectivity"" and was ""plainly erroneous"". The Chief Justice also observed that the expert in that case ""did not give … the sense that he had even a basic conception of the responsibility he owed the court when he put himself forward as an expert"".The proposed amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code will set out the duties of an expert witness (whether psychiatrists or otherwise), consistent with existing norms. A panel of psychiatrists will also be set up, such that members of this panel will be allowed to give psychiatric expert evidence in criminal cases."
university and hospital mobile research teams approaching residents for blood samples for research into vector-borne diseases,"Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the Ministry approves or condones mobile research teams from universities or hospitals approaching residents at their homes to request blood samples for research into vector-borne diseases such as dengue and Zika; (b) if so, what approvals must be sought before carrying out such exercises; (c) what oversight role does the Ministry play to ensure that residents are not exploited; and (d) how are residents' health, safety and confidential information protected during such research.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Research is important to help us better understand the distribution, causes and effects of diseases so as to strengthen the detection, prevention, control and management of these diseases.Approaching residents at their homes to seek consent for participation in such research is one way of reaching out to participants. It provides greater convenience for the research participants.Prior to embarking on any research involving human subjects, the research proposal would have to be approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB). IRBs play an important role in carrying out an independent ethical review of the need for research, and ensuring that there are adequate safety measures to protect research volunteers, including obtaining their informed consent.Informed consent should be sought from participants in an appropriate and voluntary manner, prior to commencement of the research. The benefits and risks of the research should be clearly explained, and measures put in place to protect the confidentiality of research participants against accidental loss, disclosure or unauthorised access of confidential health information.Under the Human Biomedical Research Framework of the Human Biomedical Research Act (HBRA), the role of researchers and IRBs will be formalised, and they will come under the supervision and control of a Research Institution. MOH will conduct regular audits of the Research Institutions to ensure that its systems and governance are in compliance with the HBRA. This will further strengthen the measures to protect the welfare of participants in research studies."
primary and secondary students diagnosed with myopia and astigmatism,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the number of primary and secondary students diagnosed with myopia and astigmatism over the last five years as a result of eye checks in schools; (b) what are the current eye-care campaigns in schools; and (c) whether there are assistance plans in place for students from lower-income families to obtain corrective lenses,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Health Promotion Board (HPB) conducts vision screening in pre-schools and schools. Over the last five years, the proportion of students with vision problems, including myopia and astigmatism, has been stable at about 28% among Primary 1 students, 65% among Primary 6 students, and 70% in Secondary 4 students.Since 2001, HPB and the Ministry of Education (MOE) have put in place the National Myopia Prevention Programme (NMPP). The NMPP aims to delay the onset of myopia and reduce its progression in children, through public education targeting young children, their parents and teachers to inculcate good eye care habits, and vision screening to detect and correct poor vision early.Spending more time outdoors can prevent or delay the onset of myopia. Under a NurtureSG initiative, the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) requires that children in a full day preschool programme spend at least half an hour outdoors daily. HPB has also been advocating for children to take part in outdoor activities after school and on weekends.To make spectacles affordable and accessible to students from lower income families, HPB partnered ophthalmic optics company Essilor to establish the Spectacles Voucher Fund in 2006. This provides students on MOE's financial assistance schemes who require spectacles with a $50 voucher for spectacles frame and a voucher for free lenses."
no-claim discount on annual medishield premiums,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry will consider providing a discount on annual Medishield premiums for those who do not file any claim within a requisite period of time.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: There are currently no plans to introduce a discount on annual MediShield Life premiums for those who do not file any claims. This idea was considered by the MediShield Life Review Committee when they conducted their review in 2014. After careful deliberation, the Committee decided against the idea.The Committee was concerned that, with such premium discounts, Singaporeans might delay necessary medical treatment even though they are ill, which could result in worse outcomes such as medical complications, prolonged illness, and poorer health outcomes. Health conditions that are not well managed could result in higher healthcare costs to the individual in the long run. Such features may therefore not be suited for MediShield Life as a national and basic health insurance scheme.Nevertheless, we understand the desire to recognise those who make an effort to stay healthy. The Ministry encourages healthy living through separate initiatives under the Health Promotion Board. For example, under the current Eat, Drink, Shop Healthy Challenge, Singaporeans who purchase healthier food options at participating outlets can earn Healthpoints, redeem them for supermarket and F&B vouchers, and stand a chance to win a staycation. Similarly, the National Steps Challenge also encourages participants to take more steps through vouchers and prizes."
including siblings in list of persons permitted to contribute to cpf accounts of citizens and prs for payment of medishield life and eldershield premiums,Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry will consider extending the group of persons currently permitted to make contributions to the CPF accounts of Singaporeans and PRs for payment of their MediShield Life and ElderShield premiums to include their siblings to address the concerns of those who have insufficient CPF funds as a result of their disabilities preventing them to be gainfully employed.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: All Singaporeans and PRs can make voluntary cash contributions to the Medisave accounts of their loved ones, including siblings. This can be used to pay for MediShield Life and ElderShield premiums, as well as other healthcare expenses. Medisave accounts can be topped up to the applicable Basic Healthcare Sum of the recipient, subject to the annual cap on total contributions (mandatory and voluntary) of $37,740 across all the recipient's CPF accounts.CPFB also allows MediShield Life and ElderShield premiums to be paid directly from the Medisave Account of the insured's siblings on a case-by-case basis, if the insured and immediate family members do not have sufficient Medisave, and the insured is financially dependent on their siblings. This is to help preserve the siblings' Medisave for themselves and their own immediate family members.No one will lose their MediShield Life coverage because they cannot afford the premiums. Singaporeans who require additional support after receiving means-tested subsidies and help from their families can apply for Additional Premium Support."
use of physical restraints in eldercare centres and nursing homes,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Health how widely are physical restraints being used in eldercare centres and nursing homes and whether these centres and homes are being audited for following the safeguards on the use of restraints in the Guidelines for Centre-Based Care.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Based on audits conducted by the Ministry of Health, physical restraints are not widely used in aged care facilities and generally only used as a last resort under specific circumstances, when other methods have been unsuccessful. These include situations where the senior poses an immediate risk to themselves or others, particularly those with high fall risk or those who have a tendency to pull out their life-supporting tubes. This is a professional matter which is reviewed on a regular basis by doctors and nurses in the aged care facilities. The use of restraints to ensure patient safety is also documented and discussed with caregivers.The Ministry will continue to partner the providers to strengthen care processes to bring about safer and better care for seniors. To this end, the Agency for Integrated Care facilitates regular training programmes for aged care providers as part of ongoing quality improvement efforts, including alternatives to using restraints."
defence counsel scandalising and insulting moral integrity of complainants or witnesses during cross-examination in criminal trials for sexual or child abuse offences,"Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan asked Minister for Law in each year since 2011, how many instances have there been of cross-examination by defence counsel which have been calculated to scandalise and insult the moral integrity of complainants or witnesses in criminal trials concerning sexual or child abuse offences.","Mr K Shanmugam: We do not have the specific numbers requested. However, our discussions with both the courts and the Bar indicate that while this is not yet a serious problem, such conduct does take place."
breakdown on cases of illegal parking or misuses of taxi stands from 2015 to 2017,"Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the breakdown in the number of cases of illegal parking or misuse of taxi stands by taxis and private hire vehicles in 2015, 2016 and first half of 2017; and (b) what will the Ministry do to further deter such behaviour.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The number of notices issued to taxis and private hire cars for illegal parking and stopping at taxi stands and taxi stops in 2015, 2016 and first half of 2017 are as follows:LTA will continue to deploy enforcement officers and CCTVs to deter misuse of taxi stands and taxi stops."
number of singaporeans without bank account,"Ms Tin Pei Ling asked the Prime Minister (a) what is the number of Singaporeans who do not have a bank account, broken down by age group; and (b) what is the number of Singaporeans who do not have ATM, debit or credit cards, broken down by age group.","Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): A high proportion of Singaporeans have bank accounts. While we do not have the exact numbers, based on the 2014 World Bank Global Findex survey, 96% of Singapore residents above the age of 15 have bank accounts. The figure would be higher for adults. Another source of information comes from the GST Voucher Scheme. About 40,000 Singaporeans have encashed the cheques they receive under the scheme, which could be because they do not have bank accounts.About 80% of local banks' customers hold either an ATM, debit or credit card. Within this group, more than 90% of customers aged between 16 and 59 hold a card; for customers aged 60 and above, the percentage is 70%. Those who are under the age of 16 generally do not hold cards. This is not surprising, given that child accounts are normally set up to accumulate savings and not for transactional purposes. Parents can, however, apply for ATM or debit cards for their children, and set the appropriate withdrawal and spending limits for their children.To ensure that Singaporeans have access to affordable and convenient basic banking services, major retail banks in Singapore already offer Basic Banking Accounts and these have been available since 2002. Such accounts, which generally come with ATM/debit card and Internet banking services, can be maintained at very low cost. In fact, some banks provide the service free for school-going children and the elderly by waiving the account service fees.MAS is also working with the industry and retail merchants to develop and promote new electronic payment options that are widely accepted and convenient to use, and which may not require the user to have a bank account or bank card. These include electronic wallets that can be downloaded to everyone's mobile phones easily, and wearable devices that operate similarly like wallets and can be topped up by family members conveniently. An example is the POSB Smart Buddy, which is a watch that children can use to buy food at school canteens. A similar device can be developed and customised for use by the elderly.We will continue to monitor accessibility to banking and payment services, and work with the industry to ensure that Singaporeans' needs can be most conveniently met."
regulations to prevent import of motor vehicles with known defects into singapore,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for Transport whether there are regulations in place to prevent the import of motor vehicles into Singapore that have known defects or have been subject to a manufacturer's recall.,"6 Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for Transport (a) when was the LTA notified and made aware about the manufacturer's recall and rectification of Honda Vezel vehicles owned by Uber in Singapore; (b) what were the actions taken in this case; (c) how does LTA ensure that all imported vehicles are safe especially when they are used as vehicles for hire and reward; and (d) what actions will be taken against corporate entities or individuals who knowingly violate safety measures or ignore safety concerns.Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Importers and dealers must provide documentary proof that their motor vehicles meet international vehicle safety standards before the motor vehicles can be registered for use in Singapore. Should defects be uncovered after registration, they are required to notify LTA, affected vehicle owners and prospective buyers of the defects and also arrange to recall and repair the vehicles. Vehicle owners must also produce their vehicles for rectification after receiving recall notices from their importers or dealers, after which it is the duty of importers and dealers to verify that the rectifications have been done in accordance with the manufacturers’ specifications and update LTA on the rectification progress. Importers and dealers who do not comply with the vehicle recall regulations will be fined up to $2,000 for each vehicle, subject to a maximum fine of $50,000.In April 2016, LTA was informed of Honda Japan's recall of their Honda Vezel cars, some of which are owned by Lion City Rental (LCR), a subsidiary of Uber. LTA immediately informed all importers and dealers of affected vehicles to recall the vehicles for rectification. LTA also requested the Automobile Importer & Exporter Association (AIEA) and Singapore Vehicle Traders Association (SVTA) to remind their members to begin recalling affected Honda Vezel cars for rectification.Out of the 113 importers and dealers who sold affected Honda Vezels, 89 have notified their customers of the recall and started rectifying the vehicles. Of the remaining 24 importers and dealers who have not done so, LTA has taken legal action against three and is investigating the rest. As of 4 September 2017, 42% of all affected Honda Vezels have been rectified."
effectiveness of oneinbox,Mr Leon Perera asked the Prime Minister (a) what is the total amount of public funds spent on developing and maintaining OneInbox; (b) how many people signed up for OneInbox as at 31 March 2017; (c) what are the main reasons for the low take-up rate; and (d) whether the Government plans to develop a new system to replace paper notices sent to citizens.,"Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): OneInbox was in operation from December 2013 to June 2017. It offered free digital mailbox services for citizens to receive Government correspondences electronically.The total development and maintenance cost of OneInbox was approximately $7 million.OneInbox was discontinued due to the low take-up rate. This was despite several publicity campaigns to increase awareness and adoption among citizens. As at end of March 2017, OneInbox had a total of 51,807 subscribers and delivered 296,418 digital letters. These subscribers made up less than 2% of SingPass users.OneInbox had low take-up rate because it did not offer significant value to the subscribers. Firstly, OneInbox was designed as a single-function digital mailbox service, which did not encourage sign-ups. Secondly, agencies already have well developed digital channels to serve the public, hence reducing the need for an overall Government channel. Thirdly, the traffic volume of digital letters was not high, whereby a typical individual receives less than 10 letters from the Government annually.In being innovative in exploiting technology, we would not always succeed in all that we do. We have to take risks. As part of our digital Government drive, we will continue to review and adjust our strategies and make it easier for citizens to use Government services."
rate of uptake of parent-care leave in public and private sectors from 2014 to 2016,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Prime Minister (a) what is the rate of uptake of parent-care leave by public servants for each year in the past three years; and (b) what is the number of private companies that currently offer parent-care leave.,"Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): Civil servants can take up to two days of parent-care leave a year. In the past three years, 39% (2014), 40% (2015), and 42% (2016) of civil servants took parent-care leave.Parent-care leave is not legislated. Based on a Ministry of Manpower survey in 2016, only 19% of employers offer parent-care leave."
couples with unsuccessful pregnancy after three cycles of subsidised assisted reproductive technology treatment,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Health how many couples and what is the percentage of couples who did not have a successful pregnancy after the three cycles of Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) treatment that is subsidised by the Government.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Under the assisted reproductive technology (ART) co-funding scheme, eligible couples can receive up to 75% in co-funding from the Government for ART treatment cycles, for a maximum of three fresh and three frozen ART cycles, until the patient reaches 40 years of age.MOH's AR database captures information on the number of live-births by individual ART cycles, and thus the success and failure rates at each cycle. Of Government-funded cycles of ART between 2013 and 2015, 75.3% were unsuccessful after the first cycle. This figure increased to 79.3% and 81.9% after the second and third cycles respectively. The likelihood of a successful cycle of ART is higher for those who are younger.Note Please refer to Annex A for the breakdown by year."
publication of information forecasting major supply-demand mismatch in specific job categories,Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Government intends to publish information forecasting any major supply-demand mismatch in specific job categories in conjunction with the roll-out of the various Industry Transformation Roadmaps.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: The rapid pace of technological change and keen global competition will continue to drive the faster pace of economic restructuring globally as well as here at home. To minimise mismatches in manpower supply and demand, we have identified and will continue to identify new skills needed for our people to remain employable. This is done through formulation of the Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) and Skills Frameworks for 23 major sectors in our economy. The respective ITMs and Skills Frameworks will be released progressively when completed.Our approach is to be nimble and responsive as industries transform, so as to help workers and companies stay relevant and seize opportunities in the future economy. Under the Adapt and Grow initiative, training and wage support are provided to help jobseekers overcome mismatches in skills, jobs or expectations. There are also career matching services to address ""missed matches"" by connecting jobseekers with job opportunities.The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and Workforce Singapore (WSG) have also stepped up efforts to help jobseekers get timely information and advice on job opportunities. For example, WSG recently launched Careers Connect to provide jobseekers with an expanded suite of customised career counselling and matching services. We will also be transforming the National Jobs Bank into an online jobs marketplace to better enable various groups of jobseekers to find suitable opportunities.In addition, WSG is proactively reaching out to workers who have been retrenched. The implementation of mandatory retrenchment notifications since 1 January 2017 has enabled WSG to provide affected local workers with more timely assistance to find alternative employment and relevant training to enhance their employability."
plans for asean to execute multilateral approach on china's one belt one road initiative,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether ASEAN currently has any plans to execute a multi-lateral approach in engaging with China's One Belt One Road initiative to complement existing country-specific, bilateral approaches.","Dr Vivian Balakrishnan: China's Belt and Road (B&R) initiative is significant as it has the potential to enhance connectivity and accelerate infrastructure development across the whole of Asia. Singapore was an early supporter of the initiative. Our third Government-to-Government project with China, the Chongqing Connectivity Initiative, is a key priority demonstration project under the B&R initiative. China Foreign Minister Wang Yi and I have also agreed for our two countries to jointly establish three platforms under the B&R initiative to enhance (i) connectivity; (ii) cooperation on financial services; and (iii) third party collaboration in human capital development.At the regional level, China's non-financial Overseas Direct Investment into ASEAN economies has more than doubled from 2008, reaching US$7.8 billion in 2014. Asia is expected to need US$26 trillion of investment between now and 2030 to develop power, utilities, telecommunications and transportation infrastructure. In this regard, demand for infrastructure in the region is huge.There is thus potential for the B&R initiative to complement and support existing multilateral and regional projects, including those in ASEAN. The B&R initiative and the Master Plan for ASEAN Connectivity 2025 reflect a convergence of interests between ASEAN and China. As such, ASEAN is keen to explore possible synergies, including how the B&R initiative can complement ASEAN's development plans, and vice versa, to maximise the results of our cooperation. As Country Coordinator for ASEAN-China Dialogue Relations until August 2018, Singapore is actively consulting both ASEAN Member States and China on how this will feature in our plans for the future development of the ASEAN-China strategic partnership."
vehicle inspection regime for cng taxis and private cars,Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for Transport (a) why the six-monthly and yearly vehicle inspections for CNG taxis and private car vehicle respectively have been unable to identify gas leakage problems; (b) whether there will be a review of the existing regime to ensure vehicle inspections are able to keep pace with the different vehicle types and models; and (c) whether the costs of current vehicle inspections can be reviewed downwards in view of its limited coverage.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The current vehicle inspection regime subjects CNG vehicles to compulsory checks of their CNG systems. However, following the recent fire incidents involving CNG vehicles, as a precaution, LTA required all registered CNG vehicles to be sent for immediate inspection outside of the usual inspection cycle. To enhance the thoroughness of the inspections, LTA deployed its own engineers to assist the inspection centres. The urgency of the inspections also gave vehicle owners no time to send their vehicles for pre-inspection maintenance. All this could have contributed to the higher than normal inspection failure rate.As an additional precaution, LTA has increased the inspection frequency from once every six months to once every three months for public service vehicles which use CNG, such as taxis and buses. LTA is also working with taxi operators which have CNG taxis to enhance their own inspection and maintenance regime. LTA will also work with the inspection centres to tighten their inspection process, and will double the frequency of its audits on the centres.Fees for vehicle inspections have been deregulated since 1997."
roadworthiness of cng vehicles,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Transport (a) how many CNG vehicles did not meet the testing guideline; (b) why are there so many CNG vehicles with leakages that have gone undetected for so long; and (c) what measures are in place to ensure the safety of CNG vehicles when they ply our roads.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Almost all of the 2,385 registered CNG vehicles have been inspected. About 200 were found to have gas leakage and they are being repaired or de-registered.Gas leakage is generally due to poor maintenance. Following the recent fire incidents involving CNG vehicles, as a precaution, LTA required all registered CNG vehicles to be sent for immediate inspection outside the usual inspection cycle. To enhance the thoroughness of the inspections, LTA deployed its own engineers to assist the inspection centres. The urgency of the inspections also gave vehicle owners no time to send their vehicles for pre-inspection maintenance. All this could have contributed to the higher than normal inspection failure rate.As an additional precaution, LTA has increased the inspection frequency from once every six months to once every three months for public service vehicles which use CNG, such as taxis and buses. LTA is also working with taxi operators which have CNG taxis to enhance their own inspection and maintenance regime. LTA will also work with the inspection centres to tighten their inspection process, and will double the frequency of its audits on the centres."
decline in average weekly paid overtime hours worked per employee,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what are the reasons for the further decline in the average weekly paid overtime hours worked per employee; and (b) whether the general downward trend is expected to continue.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: From 2011 to 2016, the average weekly paid overtime hours worked per employee fell from 3.7 hours to 3.3 hours1. This is due to the drop in average weekly paid overtime hours worked by employees mainly in the Manufacturing, Administrative and Support Services, and Transportation and Storage sectors.There are a number of reasons for this decline productivity improvements, and tripartite effort to reduce the excessive overtime hours to ensure workers have sufficient rest. Economic transformation has also led to an increasing proportion of managers and executives in our workforce who are not eligible for paid overtime.This decrease in paid overtime hours is in step with the overall trend of declining average usual hours worked per week. It has also been accompanied by continued growth in real median income of 3.1% per year from 2011 to 20162."
errors in tamil translations on national day parade 2017 rehearsal collaterals,Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Defence (a) whether there have been errors in the Tamil translations on the National Day Parade 2017 rehearsal collaterals; and (b) what further steps will the Ministry take to prevent a repeat of such incidents.,"Dr Ng Eng Hen: Pamphlets used during the NDP rehearsals contained errors in the Tamil translation. Investigations revealed that the original Tamil translation submitted was correct but errors were made by printers of the pamphlets. Unfortunately, some pamphlets with errors had already been distributed to the audience prior to the discovery. The NDP Executive Committee (EXCO) has apologised publicly for this mistake.The error arose because the pamphlets were not proof-read after printing and before distribution. This step has been incorporated as standard procedure for all translated texts in NDP materials. Additionally, the NDP EXCO will also ensure that the publishing companies it engages are equipped with the necessary and reliable computer software for correct printing of different languages."
loss of earnings by taxi drivers from violent or drunken passengers,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the number of taxi drivers who have suffered a loss of earnings in the last 24 months arising from issues caused by violent or drunken passengers; (b) whether taxi drivers are allowed to decline passengers who display unstable behaviour arising from alcohol intoxication; and (c) whether LTA or taxi companies provide guidelines to taxi drivers on how to request compensation for loss of earnings if their vehicles become temporarily inoperable as a result of incidents with violent or drunken passengers.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: LTA and taxi companies do not track the number of taxi drivers who have suffered loss of earnings because of violent or drunken passengers. Taxi drivers can decline passengers who are unreasonable, abusive, or exhibit signs of violence. Those who suffer losses because of violent or drunken passengers can approach their taxi companies for assistance."
applicants granted pr status under edb's global investor programme,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Trade) (a) how many applicants have been granted PR status under EDB's Global Investor Programme (GIP) since it was launched; (b) how many of these PRs have had their status subsequently withdrawn or cancelled upon review; and (c) what is the number of these PRs who have subsequently been granted citizenship, broken down by age group.","Mr Lim Hng Kiang: As of June 2017, 1,826 Global Investor Programme (GIP) applicants have been granted permanent residency since the programme’s inception in 2004. Of these, 67 have been granted citizenship. The age at which they were granted citizenship varies between 25 to 58 years old. One GIP investor had his PR status revoked upon review."
expected run-in period of new signalling system on north-south line,Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for Transport (a) how long is the run-in period of the new signalling system on the North-South Line expected to be; (b) what steps are taken to minimise the inconvenience to commuters caused by the delays; and (c) when is the signalling system expected to start delivering a higher level of service reliability and shorter waiting times for commuters.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: We expect to stabilise the new signalling system on the North-South Line soon. The current version of the software installed on July 14 is promising and has addressed the glitches encountered earlier. We still have some concerns over train-borne signalling equipment which the engineers are attending to. If there are no new surprises, we will be able to move to the next phase of testing as we inject more trains with shorter headways during peak hours. This will reduce waiting times and offer less crowded rides for commuters.Stabilisation of the North-South Line will also allow us to start testing for the East-West Line. We hope to catch the December holiday period to begin full-scale testing of the East-West Line. This assumes that the North-South Line will have stabilised before December. This is our current project timeline.Meanwhile, SMRT, LTA and Thales have over 1,600 frontline staff and engineers on stand-by to respond to any problems that may surface with the new signalling system. SMRT and LTA also have contingency plans to respond to service disruptions. These include the activation of free bus services, deployment of additional staff to affected stations, and the widespread dissemination of information on alternative transport options. The two organisations are reviewing these plans to further enhance them. But realistically, buses cannot fully cope with the dislodged passengers from affected trains during peak hour. Our objective remains to avoid delays and disruptions altogether, and to resume normal train service speedily."
efforts to catalyse reverse mortgages for private housing,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry asked the Prime Minister (a) whether there are any efforts to catalyse reverse mortgages for private housing; and (b) whether there are any guidelines and laws that govern reverse mortgages for private housing including the level of interest charged for reserve mortgages.,"Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): Financial institutions (FIs) are allowed to offer reverse mortgages. In fact, some FIs did offer reverse mortgages in the past but ceased doing so when they found a lack of demand.The terms for reverse mortgages, including applicable interest rates, are set on a commercial basis, taking into account factors such as cost of funding and credit risk.The Government has been looking at options to help Singaporeans better monetise their housing assets. For example, MAS announced in March 2017 that mortgage equity withdrawal loans need not be subject to the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) framework if the loan amount is less than 50% of the market value of the property. This will help retirees – many of whom would have paid up most of their outstanding housing loan – monetise part of the value of their property.There are alternatives to reverse mortgages or mortgage equity withdrawal loans. For instance, a property owner can choose to let out his property or a room for rental income. Eligible HDB flat owners may also monetise or right-size their flats through HDB's Lease Buyback Scheme or Silver Housing Bonus respectively.The Government will continue to review its policies to facilitate monetisation options that are relevant to meet the retirement needs of Singaporeans."
guidelines and avenues for political appointees to address allegations publicly,"Mr Chen Show Mao asked the Prime Minister what are the rules, directives, practices, understandings, standards and norms governing the circumstances under which a Minister or political appointee should defend his reputation in his official capacity in the courts or refrain from such court action and address allegations publicly, such as in Parliament.","Mr Lee Hsien Loong: I have addressed this in my Ministerial Statement on 3 July 2017. Any Minister who is accused of improper conduct must clear his name publicly. He should not allow the allegations to fester and affect the reputation of the Government. If it is a serious allegation, I would expect the Minister to take court action for defamation, unless there are other special considerations. He may also need to render account in Parliament, particularly if the matter concerns his discharge of public duties and is of public interest. These are not mutually exclusive options. In all cases, there must be public accounting."
minimum age requirement for private hire car drivers,"Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for Transport in view of the recent fatal accident involving a young driver of a private hire car, whether LTA will consider reviewing its current policy position and impose a minimum age requirement for private hire car drivers to bring it in line with that of taxi drivers.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: LTA has imposed a minimum of two years' driving experience, rather than a minimum age, on applicants for the Private Hire Car Driver's Vocational Licence. Traffic accident data does not show that there is a higher incidence of accidents among younger drivers.LTA also rejects applicants with a poor driving record, such as conviction for drunk driving and those who have had their driving licence revoked. These conditions are reviewed regularly."
increase in total number of electors for coming presidential election,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Prime Minister (a) what is the increase in the total number of electors for the coming presidential election since the last General Election; and (b) which electoral divisions have a significant increase in the number of electors.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing (for the Prime Minister): Based on the latest revised registers of electors as at 31 July 2017, there are 2,515,322 electors. This is an increase of 52,396 electors (or 2.1%) compared to the number of electors at General Election 2015.The electoral divisions with a large increase in number of electors are Sengkang West and Pasir Ris-Punggol."
food waste management strategies,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources what percentage of food waste generated is due to the throwing away of surplus food and whether the Ministry will drive and fund sharing economy solutions, such as online platforms allowing businesses and institutions to better procure surplus food, to tackle our food waste problem.","25 Mr Seah Kian Peng asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether a form of Good Samaritan Law for food can be introduced so as to reduce the 790,000 tonnes of food that goes to waste in Singapore each year.Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Food waste is a waste stream of concern to my Ministry. In 2016, food waste comprised 10% of total waste generated in Singapore. This includes both avoidable and unavoidable food waste, such as peels, bones and shells.My Ministry is studying the various sources of our food waste to get a breakdown of this figure. In 2015, the National Environment Agency (NEA) launched a study on waste disposed of by households to better understand the mix of avoidable and unavoidable food waste. We are currently analysing the data that has been collected. A similar study on waste disposed of at commercial premises such as food manufacturers, hotels and malls will commence later this year.One strategy to manage food waste is to encourage the redistribution of surplus food. The National Environment Agency (NEA) and the Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority (AVA) launched a guidebook last year to help food retail establishments develop food waste minimisation plans. The guidebook includes guidelines on the proper handling and re-distribution of excess food. Similar guidebooks will also be developed for food manufacturing establishments and supermarkets.The private and people sectors have also developed initiatives which complement the Government’s efforts. For example, the ""11th Hour"" App matches businesses with unsold food with consumers looking for last-minute deals. We are open to other ideas which could address unmet needs. Individuals or organisations with ideas can consider applying for funding under the NEA’s Call for Ideas Fund.My Ministry will study the possibility of Good Samaritan laws in Singapore with relevant agencies such as the Ministry of National Development and AVA. Such provisions which are present in countries such as the United States and Canada can provide greater clarity to potential donors of excess food.At the same time, my Ministry is mindful of the need to ensure that any food donated is fit for consumption. We thus need to strike a balance to ensure that food donors and food distributors exercise due care and practise good hygiene when distributing donated food. We will continue to work closely with our partner agencies on relevant measures to better manage food waste."
students suffering from domestic abuse,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Education (Schools) what more can be done to ensure that teachers and fellow students are able to identify and handle cases of students suffering from domestic abuse.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: Schools have systems that facilitate the early identification of students suffering from domestic violence or abuse. Teachers are equipped to look out for signs of distress in students and refer them to the school counsellor or other professional support where necessary.Students learn how to recognise sexual abuse and harassment, acquire skills to protect themselves, and understand the laws that protect them during the Form Teacher Guidance Period lessons in primary schools and Sexuality Education lessons. Students also learn that everyone has the right to safety and protection and to seek help from trusted adults, such as teachers and school counsellors.To further build trust and strengthen positive teacher-student relationships, some schools have deployed the same Form or Co-Form Teachers to a class for at least two consecutive years to help provide stability and a constant adult figure to students. Providing teacher-student interaction time also helps to ensure personalized attention on individual students.Some students may still escape the school’s attention if they are unwilling to share their problems or are able to mask their problems well. Older students can help to keep a lookout for their friends as young people invariably turn to their peers for support and understanding. Training and resources are provided to help students cultivate good values and positive mindsets; advocate for student well-being, learn coping skills, encourage help-seeking behaviour and watch out for one another in school.MOE works closely with MSF which has introduced better screening tools and training for professionals, such as teachers and school counsellors. The tools enable them to detect concerns over a child's welfare or signs of abuse and depending on the seriousness, either connect the families with community-based help, or escalate the case to MSF for intervention. All current School Counsellors and Student Welfare Officers have already been trained. The training for teachers have started and is expected to be completed by end 2018."
affordability of degree courses for mature students at autonomous universities,Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (a) how will the Ministry ensure that the cost of the modules and courses available for mature students at autonomous universities that lead to the award of degrees will be affordable; and (b) whether there are plans to extend some tuition subsidies to such students who may already have been awarded first degrees at subsidised rates.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: Within the constraints of our budget, MOE is committed to ensure that education and training remains affordable.Today, Singaporeans will typically receive a subsidy of 75% for full-time and part-time degree programmes offered at the Autonomous Universities (AUs). The subsidy rate goes up to 90% for those aged 40 and above undertaking degree programmes for the first time. We also make available education bursaries and loans to individual students, with lower income individuals receiving more.Besides degree programmes, AUs also offer many industry-relevant modular courses that help adult learners update their skills and knowledge, and stay employable and competitive. These courses are also subsidised, generally from 70 to 90% of the course fees. In 2015, the AUs delivered about 15,000 training places, many of which were offered as modular courses. MOE will work with the AUs to expand such offerings to support lifelong learning, and subsidise such courses so that they are more accessible to adult learners.An instance where an individual finds that he is not receiving a subsidy, is when he is taking a second degree. But given that resources are limited, we have to prioritise government subsidies for those pursuing their first degrees. While we support lifelong learning strongly, budget constraints are still a reality and prioritisation on how we spend public funds is needed."
time spent by teachers on marking assignments and administrative work,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Education (Schools) (a) what measures have been taken in the last three years to reduce the time spent by teachers on marking assignments and administrative work; and (b) whether the Ministry has considered measures such as (i) consolidating and centralising tasks such as marking and (ii) the use of more online tests.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: The well-being of our teachers is important and we have put in place a set of measures to guide schools in the allocation and management of teachers’ workload, which includes teaching and administrative responsibilities.As an integral part of their teaching responsibilities, teachers set assignments and assessments to find out whether students have learned the knowledge and skills set out in the national curriculum. This is an important professional role of teachers, as it is by analysing students’ performance that teachers are able to identify students’ learning needs, tailor their teaching to meet those needs and give feedback to each student. To support teachers in setting and marking assignments, the subject syllabi are accompanied by MOE-designed teaching and learning guides that include guidelines for the setting of assignment tasks. In most schools, teachers work in teams to design assessments and there is careful deployment to manage the marking workload of teachers.Teachers will deploy technology in assessment work when it is educationally purposeful to support teaching and learning. For instance, when multiple choice items are meaningful, it will be set and automatically marked by machines. Similarly, the use of digital quizzes in learning portals have enabled some basic assessment tasks to be set and automatically marked.We will also continue to incorporate greater use of technology in their administrative tasks and simplify work processes to help our teachers better manage their workload."
review of cut-off points for undergraduate courses,"Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (a) on how the cut-off points for the various undergraduate courses are decided upon; (b) given the declining cohort number due to declining birth rate and having more autonomous local universities, whether this will mean more places are being offered than demand; and (c) whether there are plans to offer more places to local students instead of them having to go overseas for their university education.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: Cut-off points for each course is an outcome of the academic results of applicants and the places available. These may vary from year to year.A larger proportion of local students will be offered places in our publicly-funded Autonomous Universities. This is because the Government has committed to progressively increase the publicly-funded university Cohort Participation Rate (CPR) from 30% in 2014 to 40% by 2020.The CPR for 2017 is 35%.As our economy continues to diversify and do well, we can align industries’ changing demands for manpower with students’ aspirations to attain degrees. In planning for publicly funded university places, a primary consideration is the employability of our graduates.In addition, our Autonomous Universities will offer more lifelong learning courses, and more Singaporeans would be able to enhance their knowledge and deepen their skills at our universities throughout different stages of their lives and careers."
class sizes in primary and secondary schools,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Education (Schools) (a) for primary and secondary schools, what is the current median and mean number of students in a class as defined by the grouping of students headed by a form teacher; and (b) what is the median and mean class size for remedial classes across primary and secondary schools respectively.","Mr Ng Chee Meng: In 2016, the average form class size in primary and secondary schools is 33 and 34 respectively. The median form class size in primary and secondary schools is 32 and 36 respectively. MOE does not track the size of remedial classes in primary and secondary schools.MOE provides schools with resources based on student and programme needs. Schools have the flexibility to deploy teachers in a targeted manner so that learning is more effective. Hence, even though form class sizes have generally remained above 30 across the levels, schools group students into smaller teaching class sizes based on learning needs or programme considerations. For instance, levelling up programmes such as the Learning Support Programme for lower primary students are conducted in pull-out classes of eight to 10, while the School-based Dyslexia Remediation programme is conducted in classes of four to six students. At secondary level, coursework subjects requiring closer teacher supervision like Design and Technology are conducted in classes of 20. Due to subject-based banding and the desire to offer a range of elective subjects to students, it is common to have teaching class sizes below 40."
number of local smes owning intellectual property rights,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Law (a) how many local SMEs own some form of intellectual property (IP); (b) how does this compare with the data from developed countries; and (c) what measures are in place to educate and support SMEs in respect of acquiring and enforcing IP.,"Mr K Shanmugam: As at July 2017, approximately 17,000 SMEs in Singapore (8% of all SMEs in Singapore) own Singapore-registered intellectual property (IP), like patents, trademarks, designs or plant variety protection. Many companies, including SMEs, also own IP in the form of copyright and trade secrets, which do not require registration. Companies can also own IP which are registered overseas for their overseas operations. Data on ownership of non-registrable IP and foreign IP are not available.Generally, most developed countries do not track or publish the number of SMEs that own registered IP. However, in the EU, a 2015 Intellectual Property Rights and Firm Performance in Europe report showed that 9% of European SMEs own registered IP in the EU. This is slightly higher than in Singapore.The Ministry of Law and the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS) recognise that our SMEs need assistance to understand and utilise IP to their advantage. We are working with other government agencies on several initiatives to assist our SMEs.IPOS leverages trade and business associations to organise activities like IP and innovation seminars. Local enterprises can also sign up for IP and IP management courses run by IPOS' training subsidiary, IP Academy. IPOS will be launching a business portal with guides and diagnostic toolkits on IP, to help SMEs understand their IP needs. In addition, IPOS' subsidiary, IP ValueLab, provides local companies with subsidised one-on-one assistance for IP audit and IP strategy development. This effort is supported by SPRING Singapore.SMEs can also obtain assistance in developing or acquiring IP. The Agency for Science, Technology and Research’s (A*STAR) Technology for Enterprise Capability Upgrading programme attaches its researchers to SMEs to help them develop in-house R&D capabilities. Its Headstart programme enables SMEs to license A*STAR's IP on preferential terms. To date, more than 650 researchers have been attached to SMEs and more than 60% of A*STAR's licences are to SMEs. Further, the Intellectual Property Intermediary, a SPRING Singapore affiliate, assists SMEs to assess their technology gaps and helps them find the IP that they need.IPOS also runs IP legal and business clinics for SMEs, where they can seek preliminary advice from IP experts and lawyers for free. The advice sought can include advice on IP disputes and enforcement. The Ministry of Law is also considering the recommendations made by the IP Dispute Resolution Review Committee chaired by Justice George Wei on how to increase access to the IP dispute resolution system, by reducing the time and cost required for IP enforcement."
review of family-related laws governing legal rights and responsibilities between step-parents and step-children,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Social and Family Development whether there is a need to comprehensively review family-related laws to define the legal rights and responsibilities between step-parents and step-children, particularly with regard to healthcare decision-making, estate succession and inheritance, and maintenance responsibilities.","Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: The primary responsibility for a child lies with his or her parents, who are collectively responsible for the upbringing and welfare of the child. In a situation where the parents are divorced, major decisions for the child, including the child’s medical and healthcare matters, may be made by the parent who has custody of the child, or by both parents if a joint custody order is made by the Courts.What rights and responsibilities there may be between a step-parent and a step-child will depend on whether there is a legal relationship between them – i.e. whether the step-parent has been conferred legal rights and responsibilities over the step-children. Such a relationship could arise through adoption or the assumption of legal guardianship.If a step-parent chooses to adopt, he or she will step into the shoes of the parent, and assume all rights and responsibilities that a parent naturally has. Alternatively, a step-parent may choose to apply to Court to be appointed as a legal guardian to his or her step-child.Under the Women's Charter, any individual who is not the parent of a child, but who has accepted a child as a member of his or her family has a duty to maintain that child, so far as the father or mother of that child fails to do so. This would apply to a step-parent who accepts the step-child as his or her family member. Again, as the primary responsibility towards the child remains with the child’s parents, the person who has accepted the child may recover such maintenance sums from the child's parent as a debt.On estate succession and inheritance, a Will generally gives a testator certainty over who the beneficiaries would be, and what each would be entitled to. A step-parent who wishes to leave any part of his or her estate to a step-child is encouraged to make a Will. Intestacy law would apply in cases where a person passes on without a will.For cases where the step-child is an adult and the step-parent is likely a senior, we speak less of rights and responsibilities, and more of ensuring that step-parents receive the support they need.The Maintenance of Parents Act allows for a person who meets the criteria in the Act to apply for maintenance from a child, including a step-child, if the step-parent is unable to maintain himself or herself adequately."
shortage of local doctors in singapore,"Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for Health (a) whether there is a shortage of local doctors in Singapore; and (b) if so, what is the Ministry doing to help (i) students better assess the prospects of pursuing medicine as a career (ii) young doctors better understand the landscape of specialisations that the country needs and (iii) the public to better understand the extent of Singapore's dependence on foreign doctors.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: As at 31 December 2016, there were about 13,000 registered doctors in Singapore, with a strong local core of 84% local doctors. As our ageing population will continue to drive demand for medical manpower, MOH has been working with MOE to review and plan our local medical training pipelines to meet Singapore's future healthcare needs.The local medical intakes have increased from 354 in 2012 to 471 in 2016, and is projected to grow to 500 in 2018. Besides growing local intakes, we are also attracting more Singaporean doctors trained overseas to return and practise in Singapore through the Pre-Employment Grant (PEG) and Relocation Incentive (RI) introduced in 2010. Since inception, about 900 PEGs and 300 RIs have been awarded. The number of newly registered overseas-trained Singaporean doctors returning annually has doubled from 92 in 2012 to 182 in 2016.While we have increased the pipelines of local doctors, foreign doctors are needed to supplement the local pool. With more Singaporeans joining the medical workforce, we expect the recruitment of foreign doctors to moderate going forward.With an ageing population, the type of disciplines in demand will shift towards the more generalist disciplines, such as Family Medicine, Internal Medicine and Geriatric Medicine. MOH has shared with medical students and junior doctors through dialogue sessions and medical residency briefing sessions on this shift. We will continue to raise awareness of the changing postgraduate training needs amongst junior doctors and medical students."
frequency of sweeping and cleaning of public areas under nea,"Ms Tin Pei Ling asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what is the frequency of sweeping and cleaning of public areas, including along the roads, highways and drains, that are under the charge of NEA; (b) whether the frequency can be increased; and (c) what are the challenges to be faced if the frequency cannot be increased.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The National Environment Agency (NEA) oversees the cleanliness of public areas in Singapore. The frequency of cleaning depends on the cleaning needs of the area. Generally, the public areas including the roads and highways are cleaned by NEA’s cleaning contractors at least three times a week. Public areas with high human traffic can be cleaned as frequently as every hour if necessary. All open drains are cleaned at the same frequency as the respective adjoining public areas.The NEA has put in place a system of regular audit checks to monitor the performance of the cleaning contractors. Besides physically inspecting the work of the contractors, the NEA officers also use technology to assess the performance of the cleaning contractors such as through sensors or cameras mounted on cleaning vehicles. Where there are service lapses, the cleaning contractors will be issued demerit points that translate into financial penalties.While the Government will continue to ensure the effectiveness of the cleaning services, it is not practical nor sustainable to constantly increase the number of cleaners or the cleaning frequency to keep public places clean. The NEA and the Public Hygiene Council, together with partners such as the Singapore Kindness Movement, have been working closely to encourage everyone to take greater ownership of our environment and establish social norms to keep our public spaces clean. Public cleanliness is a shared responsibility and it is only through our collective efforts that we can have a truly clean Singapore."
day care centres for persons with special needs,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) how many day care centres are there currently for persons with special needs above 18 years old; (b) what is the current average waiting time before a person with special needs gets a place in the centre; and (c) what are the future plans to improve the quality of day care support for adults with special needs.,"Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: Today, there are 26 Day Activity Centres (DACs) providing 1,380 places for adults with disabilities.The current average waiting time for admission is about three to six months. We anticipate this to drop with the increase in DAC places. There will be three more centres opening this year, and two more centres by the end of FY18. These new centres together with expansion of existing centres will add another 420 places, and we are on track to providing 1,800 places and reducing the waiting time to one to two months by the end of FY18.My Ministry has also embarked on efforts to build capability of DAC service providers and personnel. For example, personnel at the DACs have been taught how to use a common assessment tool that we developed to assess the daily living, social, and community living skills of clients in the various centres. This better enables the personnel to draw up individual care plans with the caregivers for each client. Appropriate intervention programmes and activities supporting the developmental needs and desired outcomes for each client are also monitored and documented to enable the clients to achieve their full potential.MSF has completed a study on the competency and training needs of the care staff in DACs in enabling them to provide better support to the clients and their families. We are also working with agencies such as the Agency for Integrated Care, Social Service Institute, and Workforce Singapore to draw up a competency framework and training roadmap for DAC staff."
conditions governing permits for construction works on terrace houses,"Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for National Development (a) under what conditions does the Government permit construction works on terrace houses that will effectively detach a house from the adjoining neighbouring house, either fully or partially; (b) how many cases have been reported to Government agencies where such works have left the wall of previously adjoined houses exposed to the elements, causing structural damage, water seepage and other problems to neighbours; and (c) which department will step in to enforce any breach of building regulations committed during the construction works.","Mr Lawrence Wong: The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) imposes two key conditions on homeowners who are granted planning permission for construction works to detach a house. One, the homeowner must plaster and paint the exposed blank wall, and neaten any exposed part of the roof of the neighbouring house as soon as his house in demolished. Two, the homeowner must also grant the neighbouring homeowner access to his property to maintain or repair the roof and exposed blank wall. The Building and Construction Authority (BCA) also requires the homeowner to engage a professional engineer to ensure that the proposed development works do not affect the structural stability of the neighbouring house.Between January 2014 and July 2017, the URA granted planning permission for 47 proposals involving the detaching of terrace and semi-detached houses. Of these, agencies have received only one complaint about construction works leading to structural damage and other problems at the neighbouring house.The BCA will investigate and take appropriate enforcement action against the homeowner or Qualified Person responsible for the development if there is any breach of the Building Control Act or Regulations during the construction process."
successful applicants for additional cpf housing grant,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for National Development (a) how many successful applications for the Additional CPF Housing Grant (AHG) have been granted to date; (b) whether HDB applies a discretionary approach when considering the condition of having at least one applicant working continuously for 12 months prior to the flat application in order to qualify for the AHG; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider extending the AHG to applicants who do not satisfy this condition due to valid reasons such as having just graduated from university.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The Additional CPF Housing Grant (AHG) was introduced in 2006 and enhanced twice in 2007 and 2009 respectively to help low- to middle-income households buy their first homes. As at 30 June 2017, the AHG has helped a total of about 93,100 households.To qualify for the grant, at least one applicant should have worked continuously for 12 months prior to the flat application, and still be employed at the point of the flat application. As buying a flat is a long-term financial commitment, this condition ensures that the applicants have the ability to service the mortgage loan for the flat. Nonetheless, HDB has been exercising flexibility for deserving households who face a shortfall from the 12-month condition, and will continue to do so.MND/HDB will continue to review our housing policies to help deserving groups with their first flat purchase."
number of hdb flats built specifically for senior citizens yearly since 2002,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the number of HDB flats completed each year since 2002 that are catered specifically for senior citizens; and (b) how many of such flats are due to be completed in each of the next five years.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB introduced the Studio Apartment (SA) scheme in 1998 to cater to the housing needs of seniors aged 55 and above. 9,119 SAs were completed between 2002 and June 2017. Another 1,875 SAs are under construction and are expected to be completed progressively by 2019.In November 2015, the SA scheme was merged with the 2-room flats scheme and replaced with the 2-room Flexi scheme. Under the new 2-room Flexi scheme, at least 40% of the 2-room Flexi flats in any Build-To-Order (BTO) project, subject to a minimum of 100 units, is set aside for seniors. 9,147 2-room Flexi flats were launched in BTO exercises between November 2015 and May 2017. These units are under construction and are expected to be completed progressively by 2021."
recidivism of local inmates of drug rehabilitation centres and long-term imprisonment regimes,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Home Affairs for each year from 2012 to 2016, what is the percentage of local inmates detained, convicted and imprisoned again for a new offence within five years from their release from (i) the Drug Rehabilitation Centres (ii) Long-Term Imprisonment 1 and (iii) Long-Term Imprisonment 2 regimes respectively.","Mr K Shanmugam: Singapore Prison Service (SPS) currently publishes two-year recidivism rates, as this is aligned with standard international calculations for measuring recidivism, and allows for meaningful comparison across time and jurisdictions.Compared to longer time spans, two-year recidivism rates are a more sensitive measure of the effectiveness of prison regimes, including the Drug Rehabilitation Centre (DRC) and Long-Term Imprisonment (LT). After the two-year mark, ex-offenders' behaviour would tend to be influenced more by other environmental factors. Recidivism rates over a longer time frame will hence be higher.The two-year recidivism rates for persons released from DRC, LT1 and LT2 from 2012 to 2014 are as follows. The two-year recidivism rates for 2015 and 2016 are not available yet."
lapsed life insurance policies/saving plans due to non-payment of premiums,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Prime Minister (a) in the past six years, how many policy holders have allowed their life insurance policies/saving plans to lapse due to non-payment of premiums; and (b) whether the Ministry will require all insurance agents and agencies to inform their customers that they can sell their life insurance and saving plans in the secondary market.","Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): Between 2011 to 2016, the percentage of life insurance policies / savings plans in-force with licensed insurers in Singapore which were surrendered each year increased slightly from 3.2% to 3.6%. The absolute number of surrendered policies was about 196,000 in 2016. These include policies surrendered voluntarily for reasons other than an inability to continue premium payments.In comparison, the surrender rates in Hong Kong from 2011 to 2016 range from 3.6% to 4.4%. In the European Union and Switzerland, the rate is 5-6%, based on data from 2010 to 2014.Life insurance policies are designed to yield the intended benefits only if the policies are held for their full terms. Therefore, there are rules requiring insurance agents and financial advisers, in recommending these policies, to conduct a proper client needs analysis, including the financial ability and willingness of their clients to commit to premium payments for the full term of the insurance product.MAS does not require insurance agents and financial advisers to advise their clients that they can sell their life insurance policies in the secondary market. Whilst this is possible, some policyholders may be concerned that potential owners of these policies will benefit from the death or disability of the life insureds4, even though they are unrelated to the life insureds.However, if policyholders find themselves unable to continue paying their premiums, they could avail themselves of various options provided by insurers. These include obtaining a loan against the policy value from the insurer to pay for the premium, surrendering the policy for a sum of money, or reducing the protection coverage. Policyholders could approach their insurers, insurance agents or financial advisers for help in considering these options."
applicants for sale of tissue packs under street hawking scheme,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) in each year from 2011 to 2016, how many applications have been received from Singaporeans to sell tissue packs under the Street Hawking Scheme; (b) how many of these applications have been successful; and (c) what are the main reasons for rejecting the applications.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The original intent of the Street Hawking Scheme is to help needy Singaporeans and Permanent Residents tide over their financial difficulties. Under this scheme, licensed street hawkers are allowed to sell only certain goods including newspapers, ice-cream, canned drinks, costume jewellery and phone cards at specific, fixed locations in public spaces. These specific, fixed locations are designated by the Town Council or relevant land agency in order to minimise the disamenities to residents as well as unfair competition to the businesses and other stakeholders in the vicinity.Since 2011, we have received about 200 applications from Singaporeans to sell tissue paper under the Street Hawking Scheme. Of these, 24 were successful. The others were rejected mostly because the applicants had failed to show that they had financial difficulties or they wanted to operate at multiple locations which is not allowed under the Street Hawking Scheme.Street hawking is not a permanent solution for someone trying to make a living. Those experiencing financial hardship can and are being assisted by the Government through the various help and job placement schemes as well as training programmes for those who wish to pick up new skills and seek more stable forms of employment."
residents on hdb public rental scheme,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for National Development in respect of residents on the HDB Public Rental Scheme who have sold a HDB flat before (a) for how long is the fact of this sale considered in deciding on appeals for lower rentals due to fluctuations in income and economic circumstances; and (b) whether the share of sale proceeds which divorcees receive is taken into consideration in deciding such appeals.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB's public rental rates are highly subsidised. To ensure that rental flats are provided to households who are most in need, one of the considerations that HDB takes into account in assessing applications for public rental flats is the sales proceeds from their last flat sale. If the applicants' housing budget, which includes their balance sales proceeds, CPF savings and loan quantum, is sufficient for them to buy a flat, they will not be eligible for a rental flat.For households who are in public rental flats, HDB considers appeals for lower rentals taking into account the households' prevailing circumstances, such as the current household income, expenses for medical needs and the number of dependents. HDB will work with social agencies to offer assistance where necessary, and reduce the rentals if these households face genuine financial difficulty. Sale proceeds from the sale of previous flats are not considered in assessing such appeals."
quality internship opportunities for students of vocational institutions,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) what measures are in place to ensure quality internship opportunities are available to all students at vocational institutions.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: Internships are an important aspect of applied education in the polytechnics and Institute of Technical Education (ITE). They provide students with critical hands-on training and meaningful learning experiences in a real-world context, to better prepare them for work in the industry.The polytechnics and ITE work closely with partners, such as companies, trade associations, and government agencies to design internship programmes, including identifying key competencies that the intern should acquire and other desired learning outcomes. These are shared with companies to ensure that both sides have a common understanding of the roles and responsibilities. In addition, our lecturers routinely conduct site visits to meet with students and their company supervisors, in order to seek feedback and monitor the progress of the internship. Students are also required to submit reports of their learning, both during and after their internship, to ensure that learning outcomes are met."
rental bicycle users fined for illegal parking,"Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Transport (a) to date, how many rental bicycle users have been fined for illegal parking; and (b) whether LTA has encountered any problems from rental bicycle companies in obtaining details of errant users.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Land Transport Authority (LTA) requires the bicycle-sharing companies to remove their bicycles which are indiscriminately parked. If the bicycles are not removed within half a day, LTA will impound them, levy a fee on the companies for the resources used for the impounding, and fine the companies. LTA has served around 1000 notices for indiscriminately parked bicycles, of which 200 have been impounded."
daily average total number of people in singapore for past three years,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Prime Minister for the past three years, what has been the daily average total number of people in Singapore including residents and non-residents.","Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): The number of residents and non-residents in Singapore in the past three years, based on consolidated figures as at end June each year, are in Table 1. Data on the number of residents and non-residents tracked on a daily basis are not available."

daily average total number of people in singapore for past three years,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Prime Minister for the past three years, what has been the daily average total number of people in Singapore including residents and non-residents.","Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): The number of residents and non-residents in Singapore in the past three years, based on consolidated figures as at end June each year, are in Table 1. Data on the number of residents and non-residents tracked on a daily basis are not available."
measures to assess and maintain stability of singapore financial system,Dr Tan Wu Meng asked the Prime Minister what measures are used to assess and maintain the stability of the Singapore financial system (i) at the level of individual financial institutions (ii) at a whole-of-system level and (iii) in respect of how polices affecting individual financial institutions can influence system stability through network structure and network effects.,"Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) promotes financial stability in Singapore through microprudential supervision of individual financial institutions, as well as conducting macroprudential surveillance of the financial system as a whole. The two are related and closely coordinated, to provide a comprehensive approach to preserving a stable and sound entire financial system.In its microprudential supervision, MAS covers all financial institutions (FIs) – banks, insurers, and capital market players. Only well-managed and reputable FIs are allowed to operate in Singapore. Once admitted, FIs must continue to meet the necessary regulatory requirements and standards. In designing these requirements, MAS draws reference from global standards and best practices, consults industry and other stakeholders, and carries out impact studies. This allows MAS to consider potential spillover effects of regulations on the broader economy and financial system and finetune the regulations as appropriate. This is further complemented by on-site inspections and regular off-site reviews of FIs' operations to check that they are managing their risks properly. In this regard, MAS adopts a risk-focused supervisory approach, paying closer attention to FIs that are more systemically important.As for macroprudential surveillance, MAS seeks to identify potential financial stability risks arising from global and domestic economic and financial market developments. Like other major regulators, we want to identify these risks before they materialise, so that appropriate measures can be taken to avert systemic problems.MAS employs a variety of tools to do this. These include (a) a broad suite of indicators to monitor any build-up of risks in the system; (b) model-based approaches to assess systemic risk and policy effectiveness; (c) stress tests to understand how adverse scenarios could affect individual FIs as well as the financial system; and (d) network analysis to assess how financial distress could spread from one FI to others in the system through various interconnections.These tools help MAS identify common vulnerabilities across FIs and in the corporate and household sectors, as well as the channels by which risks can propagate through the financial system.MAS has also identified a group of domestic systemically important banks (""D-SIBs"").5 These D-SIBs are subject to additional regulatory requirements, such as higher capital and liquidity buffers, enhanced disclosure, and recovery and resolution planning, to strengthen their resilience.MAS is committed to proactive surveillance and robust supervision to safeguard the stability of the financial system in Singapore. The International Monetary Fund's Financial Sector Assessment Programme in 2013 found Singapore’s financial sector to be well-regulated and supervised and described the regulatory and supervisory framework as ""among the best globally""."
status of civil service's management support scheme,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Prime Minister (a) how many officers on the Civil Service's Management Support Scheme have been and are to be transferred to the Management Executive Scheme; and (b) whether the Management Support Scheme will be phased out.,"Mr Lee Hsien Loong: Transfers from the Management Support Scheme to the Management Executive Scheme are not compulsory. Serving officers have the option to transfer to the extended Management Executive Scheme or remain on the Management Support Scheme. As of May 20176, 2,465 (42%) Management Support Officers have transferred to the extended Management Executive Scheme.While we no longer recruit officers on the Management Support Scheme, it will not be phased out until the last officer transfers out or retires from the scheme. Officers are free to transfer to the extended Management Executive Scheme whenever they are ready. Officers can engage their supervisors and HR departments on the career pathway that would best fulfil their aspirations before coming to a decision."
noise mitigation measures along stretches of central expressway near residential areas,"Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for Transport in view of high noise levels facing residential homes close to and/or facing the Central Expressway, whether the Ministry has plans to add additional noise mitigation measures or sound barriers on these stretches of the Central Expressway.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: We are exploring a number of ways to reduce road noise, such as noise barriers and low-noise road surface mix. Trials on the effectiveness of these measures are underway."
hdb dwellers concurrently owning private residential and commercial properties,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development (a) how many current HDB dwellers concurrently own one and more than one private property respectively with a breakdown into residential and commercial private properties; (b) of these HDB dwellers, how many of them are servicing both the HDB housing loan and private bank loans; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider allowing only those who have completed paying the HDB housing loan fully to invest in private residential properties.","Mr Lawrence Wong: As at 30 April 2017, about 54,300 HDB households, or less than 6% of all HDB households, concurrently own private properties. Of these, the vast majority (about 80%) own only one private property. By property type, close to 80% of these households own just residential properties, while the remainder own commercial properties (such as shop houses, hawker stalls, and warehouse spaces) or a combination of both.Among HDB households who concurrently own private properties, about 7,100, or 13%, are servicing their HDB housing loans. HDB does not have data on whether these households have outstanding bank loans on their private properties.Nonetheless, there are existing measures to safeguard financial prudence and prevent individuals from over-leveraging when they purchase properties. For instance, an individual with an outstanding HDB loan will be subject to a higher cash down payment and a tighter loan-to-value (LTV) limit when he borrows to purchase a private residential property. Additional Buyer’s Stamp Duty (ABSD) will also apply to his second and subsequent property purchases. In addition, he will be subject to the Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR) framework, which requires a financial institution to take into consideration his total outstanding debt obligations when assessing his loan application. This ensures that the borrower’s total monthly debt repayment obligations do not exceed 60% of his monthly income.We will continue monitoring the market closely and will review the necessary measures as conditions evolve."
drowning cases involving recreational users at public beaches,"Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for National Development (a) in the past five years, how many cases of drowning involving recreational users at public beaches have been reported; (b) what are the measures in place to ensure the safety of recreational users at public beaches; (c) how does the Ministry determine the number and distribution of rescue floats at beaches; (d) how many lifeguards are actively on duty along public beaches at any given time; and (e) what is the rationale for not having permanent beach patrols and lifeguards at public beaches.","Mr Lawrence Wong: There have been 11 drowning fatalities involving recreational users at public beaches over the past five years.Efforts made to help keep swimmers safe include signs in prominent locations to advise beach users about the dangers of swimming in open water. Lifebuoys are deployed at highly visible locations not more than 300 metres apart. There are also patrols at beaches with a high volume of swimmers, like Palawan Beach. There are at least 14 patrol officers on duty each day at these types of beaches.More broadly, the Government has taken steps to equip children with basic water safety skills. For example, MOE requires all primary school pupils to take part in the SwimSafer programme as part of the Physical Education syllabus. This is done in partnership with SportSG.That said, safety measures cannot be 100%. We urge all recreational users to remain vigilant while swimming in open water. Parents should also closely supervise their children at beaches at all times."
conversion of landed properties for student accommodation,"Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for National Development whether the conversion of two or more landed properties for student accommodation with related services by a single operator should be classified as non-residential use akin to the running of a student hostel and, if so, whether URA will consider regulating such business activities within private estates in view of the inconveniences caused to other residents.","Mr Lawrence Wong: The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) maintains guidelines on the use of any premises as a student hostel. For example, sites which are located in estates safeguarded for landed housing are generally disallowed from being used for student hostels. Any party who wishes to operate his premises as a student hostel must first obtain planning permission from URA for this use.But private homes can be let out for rental to students so long as the use of the home fully complies with URA's planning guidelines on residential use. These guidelines, which include a minimum duration of stay and a cap on the total number of occupants per home, are intended to prevent dis-amenity to neighbouring residents resulting from problems such as overcrowding and the frequent turnover of tenants."
sharing of repair cost for water leakage from upper floor flat,Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for National Development whether there should be a cap on the number of times a lower floor flat is obliged to share the cost of repair for water leakage from the upper floor flat within a specific time period.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Under the HDB lease, the repair of leaks in the party structure is a joint responsibility between upper- and lower-floor flat owners. When there is a leak, both upper- and lower-floor flat owners would need to liaise with each other to investigate and carry out repairs. In most cases, issues concerning leaks can be amicably resolved when flat owners exercise mutual understanding and cooperate with one another.There is no cap on the number of times upper and lower floor flat owners are obliged to share in the cost of repair for leaks due to wear and tear. However, if the cause of the leak at the lower floor flat is due to renovations carried out at the upper floor flat, the upper floor flat owner will be fully responsible for rectifying the leak and bearing the full repair cost.For ceiling leaks caused by wear and tear, HDB may also offer assistance to flat owners to repair and co-share the cost of repairs under the Goodwill Repair Assistance Scheme. Under this scheme, HDB will pay 50% of the ceiling leak repair cost. The remaining 50% is then shared equally between the upper- and lower-floor flat owners."
cases of homeless persons who choose to remain homeless instead of going to a shelter,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) from 2011 to 2016, what is the number of cases of homeless persons who choose to remain homeless instead of going to a shelter; and (b) what is the procedure for handling persons who choose to remain homeless.","Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: MSF does not track the number of persons who choose to remain homeless instead of being admitted into shelters.When MSF receives information on persons who may be homeless, we initiate contact with these persons on the ground to offer assistance. Those assessed to be homeless and in need of immediate shelter are admitted into shelters. They may also be referred to Social Service Offices and Family Service Centres for financial and employment assistance or to address family issues. Some decline assistance or have alternative accommodation options with family and friends. Others may have homes of their own but choose to sleep in public because of family disputes or other considerations.MSF and our partners in the community will continue to identify and provide support to homeless persons where needed."
cigarette and tobacco smuggling in singapore,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked the Minister for Finance whether the Ministry can provide an update on the situation of illicit cigarette and tobacco smuggling in Singapore especially in the last three to five years.,"Mr Heng Swee Keat: Strong enforcement efforts and close-interagency collaboration have kept the contraband tobacco situation in Singapore in check.From 2014 to 2016, the number of contraband tobacco offenders, which includes smugglers, peddlers and buyers, fell by 16% from 24,840 in 2014 to 20,751 in 2016. Non-cigarette offenders made up less than 5% of those caught.In the same period, the amount of duty-unpaid cigarettes seized by the Singapore Customs fell by 7% from 3 million to 2.8 million packets.Singapore Customs will continue to work with other enforcement agencies such as the Singapore Police Force and the Immigrations & Checkpoint Authority to deter the buying and selling of contraband tobacco. We will also continue to actively engage the public to raise awareness on this issue."
allowing private property owners to purchase hdb's two-room flexi flats for owner occupation without need to dispose of private property,Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for National Development whether HDB will allow owners of private property to purchase HDB's two-room flexi flats strictly for owner occupation and without the need to dispose of their private property.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: New HDB flats are heavily subsidised. With finite resources, the Government has to prioritise such housing for those who need them more, such as first-time homebuyers and households who cannot afford private housing.Private property owners are therefore generally not eligible to buy new HDB flats. Nonetheless, to facilitate housing monetisation, we allow elderly private property owners aged 55 and above to buy new 2-room Flexi flats on shorter leases of between 15 and 45 years. They will have to dispose of their private property within six months of taking possession of the flat."
use of community improvement projects committee funds for construction of bicycle sheds and double-tier bicycle racks,Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry will consider setting aside special Community Improvement Projects Committee (CIPC) funds to support the construction of bicycle sheds and double-tier bicycle racks to support the increasing number of bicycles at HDB estates.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Currently, Community Improvement Projects Committee (CIPC) funding is allocated to Citizens' Consultative Committees (CCCs), which have the flexibility to decide which projects to prioritise based on local needs. Apart from infrastructural and recreational facilities such as covered walkways, footpaths, and playgrounds, CIPC funds may also be used for the provision of bicycle sheds and double-tier bicycle racks."
estate upgrading programme for private estates,"Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for National Development whether and, if so, when the Government will be calling for proposals for new projects under the Estate Upgrading Programme for private estates.","Mr Lawrence Wong: It is the intention of the Government to continue to invite nominations for the Estate Upgrading Programme (EUP). The date for new nominations has yet to be determined. There are currently 17 ongoing EUP projects from various Batches islandwide, with the most recent under EUP Batch 9 being awarded their consultancy tenders just last month. We would like to complete some of these ongoing projects first, before calling for new nominations. This will allow us to devote the requisite resources to better manage the new projects."
measures to ensure students are relevant to future economy on graduation,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) what is being done to ensure that our students will be relevant to the future economy when they graduate.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: Across the post-secondary education institutions (PSEIs), graduate employment outcomes continue to be strong, with around nine in 10 graduates securing employment within six months of their graduation. This is because MOE and the PSEIs work closely with industries to regularly update curriculum and pedagogy, to ensure that students are equipped with relevant knowledge and skills when they enter the workforce.In terms of curriculum, PSEIs frequently engage industry representatives to stay abreast with latest development in industries. PSEIs engage industry practitioners to undertake a good part of the teaching. They are also involved in the work of the Sectoral Tripartite Committees, which drive the development and implementation of Industry Transformation Maps.In terms of pedagogy, there is an increased emphasis to balance acquisition of academic knowledge and practical skills, especially through learning by doing. For instance, a large majority of PSEI students already go for internships. We have also rolled out the SkillsFuture Earn and Learn Programme and the Work Study Degree Programmes, which are modelled upon work-learn apprenticeship programmes in countries like Germany and Switzerland.The employability of students is very much related to their competence, which in turns reflects their aptitude and enthusiasm for the discipline they have chosen. The PSEIs have also strengthened education and career guidance (ECG) efforts to support students in making informed decisions on their career aspirations. Students have access to a wide range of resources such as information on industries and growth prospects, as well as ECG counsellors or career coaches to guide students on career preparation and skills upgrading opportunities. PSEIs are also increasingly moving towards aptitude based admission that takes into account the students strengths and interests.MOE also requires all our PSEIs to measure employment outcomes of their graduates annually and publish the results. This helps students make informed choices, and focus the PSEIs on the industry relevance of their courses. From this year, the requirement will be extended to private education institutions offering degree qualifications.Students are also encouraged to continually upgrade their skills even after graduation, to stay responsive to a rapidly changing workplace. The PSEIs are expanding the range of short, skills-based courses they offer. Together with the programmes offered by private training providers, these broaden the learning opportunities for working adults to upgrade and deepen their skills.Collectively, these initiatives contribute to an education and training system that is responsive to industry needs and ensure that individuals remain relevant to the future economy."
steps to retrain workers with requisite skills to secure jobs in next 10 years,"Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) in light of the recommendations by the Committee on the Future Economy, what further steps will be taken to retrain workers to ensure they have the requisite skills to secure jobs in the next 10 years.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: To help Singaporeans better prepare for the future, we will be focusing on three areas within the SkillsFuture movement.First, we will increase the range of training programmes available for workers to stay employable. The Post-Secondary Education Institutions (PSEIs), namely, ITE, Polytechnics and Autonomous Universities, include lifelong learning as part of their core mission, and have developed more flexible, bite-sized and industry-aligned modules targeted at adult learners. This is in addition to the efforts of private training providers. Later this year, we will also launch the SkillsFuture for Digital Workplace programme to equip Singaporeans with foundational digital literacy skills in key areas such as understanding of data, technology and cyber security, as well as cultivating a mindset for change and innovation.Second, we are enhancing our efforts in education and career guidance to help Singaporeans make informed decisions regarding skills development, training and jobs. Specifically, we will launch two initiatives, namely MySkillsFuture and the SkillsFuture Engage. MySkillsFuture is a one-stop online portal offering a suite of tools and resources that will enable Singaporeans to understand labour market information, search for jobs and training programmes, and chart their skills development and career pathways. Under SkillsFuture Engage, we will deliver career and training advisory to Singaporeans at the community level, including guiding them to use MySkillsFuture portal, and choosing the right training programmes and careers.Third, the PSEIs are working closely with MOM and WSG to expand the Professional Conversion Programmes. These programmes help mid-career adults to undergo skills conversion and move into new occupations or sectors that have good prospects and opportunities for progression.We will continue to build on SkillsFuture efforts to enable Singaporeans to learn through life and continually upgrade their skills. We encourage Singaporeans to make the best use of the various programmes and initiatives."
indiscriminate use of pest poisons by pest control companies,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what measures and regulations are in place to prevent pest control companies from placing and using hazardous bait, such as poison, in such a way that the safety of other wildlife and vulnerable members of public could be harmed; and (b) whether the Ministry can enforce stronger rules to prevent the indiscriminate use of pest poisons.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Vector control operators are regulated by the National Environment Agency (NEA) under the Control of Vectors and Pesticides Act (CVPA). All personnel involved in vector control work have to undergo mandatory training in the safe handling and use of pesticides before they are licensed or certified by the NEA. For instance, vector control personnel are trained to only dispense rat bait in rat burrows or in tamper-proof bait stations which other animals cannot easily access.Apart from regulating vector control operators, the NEA also regulates the use of pesticides to ensure that they do not pose any public health concerns. NEA's evaluation of pesticides is done in accordance with the World Health Organization Pesticide Evaluation Scheme (WHOPES) and only pesticides that are approved for use by the NEA can be sold in Singapore after they are registered, labelled and classified properly.My Ministry takes a serious view of the indiscriminate use of pesticides and will take enforcement action against any vector control operator and vector control personnel who infringe the regulations. Any person caught conducting vector control work without a licence shall be liable for a court fine of up to $20,000 or imprisonment for up to three months, or both. The NEA may also suspend or cancel the registration of any vector control operator or the licence of any vector control personnel in cases where there are serious breaches of its licensing conditions.These penalties have proved to be a sufficient deterrence. Over the past five years, there have only been six incidents that required enforcement actions to be taken against vector control operators or personnel. Hence, there is no need to put in place stiffer penalties to prevent the indiscriminate use of pesticides."
"breakdown of singaporean and pr professionals, managers and executives in 25th and 50th-80th percentiles of basic and gross monthly salaries","Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Minister for Manpower as at 2017, what is the breakdown for Singaporeans and permanent residents who are professionals, managers and executives in Singapore in terms of the 25th, 50th, 60th, 70th, 75th and 80th percentile of the (i) basic monthly salary (including and excluding employer CPF contributions) and (ii) gross monthly salary (including and excluding employer CPF contributions).","Mr Lim Swee Say: Since 2016, the Ministry has adopted the reporting of occupation data for Professionals, Managers, Executives and Technicians (PMETs) instead of Professionals, Managers and Executives (PMEs). This is because the two job categories of PME and Associate Professionals and Technicians (APT) will become less distinct in the future economy.The breakdown of gross monthly income (including employer CPF contributions) by percentiles as at June 2013 and June 2016, for full time employed residents7 who are PMETs, is provided in Table 1.Data on basic monthly income is not available.Table 1 Gross Monthly Income from Work8 (including Employer CPF contributions) of Full-Time Employed9 Resident PMETs, June 2013 and 2016"
real and nominal wage growth for singaporeans in each decile for last 10 years,Mr Chen Show Mao asked the Minister for Manpower what was the real and nominal wage growth for Singaporeans in each income decile for each of the last 10 years.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: The Ministry of Manpower monitors the wage outcome of the workforce by tracking income trends at the 20th percentile10 (low-wage workers) and 50th percentile (general workers). The annual change in nominal and real11 gross monthly income (including employer CPF contributions) by the 20th and 50th percentile for Full-Time Employed12 Singaporeans, from 2007 to 2016, is provided in Table 1.Table 1 Annual Change (%) in Gross Monthly Income from Work13 (including Employer CPF contributions) of Full-Time Employed Singaporeans, June 2007-2016"
cpf education scheme for part-time diploma or degree courses at approved educational institutions,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Ministry will review the CPF Education Scheme to allow it to be used for part-time diploma or degree courses at approved educational institutions.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: The CPF is primarily for retirement. Monies in the Ordinary Account can be used for housing, and monies in the Medisave Account can be used for healthcare. We introduced the CPF Education Scheme in 1989. Under this scheme, members can use their CPF Ordinary Account savings to pay for their own, children's, or spouse's subsidised tuition fees. Only full-time subsidised diploma or degree courses at Approved Educational Institutions are covered.With increasing life expectancy, we need to make sure CPF members have set aside enough savings in their CPF account to meet their basic retirement needs. Hence, we need to be careful about expanding the use of CPF to allow for more withdrawals to be made, including to cover part-time diploma or degree courses.Singaporeans who require financial assistance to pay for the tuition fees of their part-time degree courses can consider the Tuition Fee Loan which covers up to 90% of the tuition fees. Those who have taken the maximum Tuition Fee Loan and require further financial assistance can also consider the Study Loan. Together, the Tuition Fee Loan and the Study Loan will cover 100% of the subsidised tuition fees payable. MOE also subsidises tuition fees for part-time diplomas and offers bursaries to students who require financial assistance."
minimum safety standards for motor vehicle repairs and modification works,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Transport in view of the number of fires in vehicles due to electrical and overheating causes (a) how can the Ministry ensure that the quality of work performed in our local car workshops meet the minimum standards for safety; and (b) how can the Ministry ensure the roadworthiness and safety of foreign vehicles entering Singapore as well as local vehicles which have had repairs and modification works done outside of Singapore.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The owner of a vehicle is responsible for ensuring that it is roadworthy. LTA conducts spot-checks on both local and foreign vehicles travelling on the roads. Vehicles that do not meet roadworthiness standards are impounded and the owners penalised under the Road Traffic Act. In addition, all Singapore-registered vehicles are required to undergo regular inspections, and vehicles that fail these inspections cannot be used on the roads. For their and other road users' safety, we strongly advise vehicle owners to use reputable workshops for maintenance and repairs."
employment passes and s-passes issued to applicants with certificates from degree mills and unaccredited schools,"Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for Manpower in each of the years from 2014 to date, how many employment passes and S-Passes have been issued to applicants with certificates from degree mills or unaccredited schools.","Mr Lim Swee Say: Employment Pass (EP) and S-Pass applications are assessed based on a combination of factors including qualifications, working experience and salary.Before July 2015, for applications that contained qualifications obtained from unaccredited institutions, MOM would disregard these qualifications and the applicants had to meet more stringent criteria in terms of working experience and salary in order to qualify for the EP or S-Pass. On this basis, 310 passes were issued in 2014 and 190 in the first half of 2015.Since July 2015, MOM no longer accepts new EP and S-Pass applications that contain any doubtful qualification."
extension of bus service 983 to cover keat hong close,"Mr Zaqy Mohamad asked the Minister for Transport in view of increased residents in Keat Hong Pride and Keat Hong Crest, whether LTA will consider having bus service 983 routed through Keat Hong Close and, if not, what are the reasons or barriers.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: These are new estates and we are closely monitoring travel patterns there. A rule of thumb is to ensure that there are public bus services within 400 metres of developments, subject to there being a minimum level of ridership.Meanwhile, Service 983 is accessible within 400 metres from developments at Keat Hong Close. If a shorter walking distance is preferred, residents can walk around 300 metres to take Service 301, and make a same bus-stop transfer to Service 983 along Choa Chu Kang Avenue 6."
employment passes and s-passes issued to persons who have renounced singapore citizenship,"Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for Manpower in the last five years, how many employment passes and S-Passes have been issued to persons who have previously given up Singapore citizenship.","Mr Lim Swee Say: From 2012 to 2016, an average of 65 new Employment Passes and S Passes were issued each year to individuals who had previously given up their Singapore Citizenship. Every work pass application is assessed carefully and in consultation with relevant agencies. A variety of factors is considered including: (i) how much time has elapsed since Singapore Citizenship was renounced; (ii) whether the applicant has any ties to another citizen; and (iii) whether the applicant had avoided any obligations to the State when he gave up Singapore Citizenship."
update on national electric vehicle car-sharing scheme,Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether he can provide a progress update on the national electric vehicle (EV) car-sharing scheme that is scheduled for roll-out in mid-2017; and (b) what has been the take-up rate of the EV car-sharing scheme and the construction status of the EV stations and charging points in the selected HDB towns.,Mr Khaw Boon Wan: First phase of the BlueSG electric vehicle car-sharing programme will commence in the next few months. The services will begin with 125 electric cars and 200 charging points across 50 car parks. LTA and BlueSG are currently discussing with the various communities on the specific car park lots to install the charging points and to complete the legal documents.
inclusion of sennett estate in walk2ride programme,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for Transport whether LTA can consider including Sennett Estate in its Walk2Ride programme and build sheltered linkways from the estate to surrounding transport nodes such as MRT stations and bus stops.,Mr Khaw Boon Wan: We will link up Potong Pasir MRT station and the perimeter of Sennett Estate nearest to the station with covered linkways.
average waiting time for new appointments at specialist outpatient clinics at public hospitals,"Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for Health in each year since 2013, what is the average waiting time for new appointments at Specialist Outpatient Clinics at the public hospitals.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Specialist Outpatient Clinic (SOC) waiting times for new appointments vary across hospitals and across specialties within each hospital. The median waiting time for new, non-urgent subsidised appointments at Specialist Outpatient Clinics (SOC) has reduced slightly from 29 days in 2013 to 27 days in the first quarter of 2017, despite an increasing patient load across all hospitals (see Table 1). Patients with more urgent conditions such as suspected cancers and cardiac conditions are fast-tracked for their appointments."
cause of lapse in use of partially sterilised instruments at national dental centre in june 2017,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the cause of the lapse leading to use of the partially sterilised instruments on patients at the National Dental Centre (NDC) in June 2017; (b) what are the procedural weaknesses in the NDC's process for ensuring that instruments are fully sterilised before use; and (c) what measures have been taken to ensure that similar lapses do not occur again.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Patient safety is of utmost importance to our public healthcare institutions. We apologise for the lapse at the National Dental Centre Singapore (NDCS) on 5 and 6 June, which had led to the use of partially sterilised dental instruments.SingHealth has conducted an investigation and MOH has received its report on 30 June 2017. The Ministry is reviewing the report and is also conducting its own investigation.The SingHealth investigation showed that the incident originated from human error by a staff, who failed to complete all the steps in the sterilisation process for one batch of dental instruments. In addition, her supervisor and department manager did not fully recognise the potential impact of the error. As a result, there was a delay in escalating the incident to senior management, and up to 72 packs of affected instruments might have been used on patients, before all affected instruments were successfully recalled.The findings also revealed procedural weaknesses and a lack of vigilance amongst some staff. At various points of the process – from the issuance of the instruments from the Central Sterile Supplies Department (CSSD), through the receipt of the instruments at the clinics, to the unpacking of the instruments before use on patients, the error could have been detected and an alert raised.Following the incident, NDCS has instituted immediate corrective measures. Additional independent verifications have been put in place to ensure completeness of the sterilisation process. Clearer work instructions have been disseminated to all staff to ensure that the sterility of the dental instruments are checked prior to use.NDCS will strengthen the following(i) Standard operating procedures for sterilisation, handover and use of dental instruments;(ii) Documentation and inventory accounting process for sterilisation and movement of dental instruments from CSSD to the clinics, and(iii) Incident escalation and reporting, recall and risk management frameworks.In addition, NDCS will institute regular training and competency assessments for all staff involved in the sterilisation and handling of instruments to ensure familiarity with the processes.While the risk of infection to affected patients is extremely low in this incident, it is a serious breach of the institution's infection control system nonetheless. Our healthcare institutions need to be more vigilant, and have a stronger reporting and incident escalation culture. These will enable us to detect and mitigate any incidents expeditiously. The learning points from this incident will be shared across the healthcare clusters, so that we can collectively improve our standard of patient safety and care."
competitiveness and health of singapore's wafer fabrication and semiconductor industry cluster,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (a) whether he can provide an update on the competitiveness and health of Singapore's wafer fabrication and semiconductor industry cluster; and (b) what measures are being taken to maintain and enhance the competitiveness of wafer fabrication in Singapore versus other competing global locations for fabs.,"Mr S Iswaran: Singapore has a well-established semiconductor cluster, with leading global firms in Integrated Circuit (IC) design, wafer fabrication, as well as assembly and test, supported by an ecosystem of equipment vendors and suppliers. Between 2011 to 2016, the manufacturing output from our semiconductor cluster grew at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 4.3%14. Singapore continues to be an attractive location for high-value semiconductor manufacturing activities. For example, last September, Micron opened its expanded 3D NAND flash memory fabrication facility in Singapore, an investment totalling S$5.4 billion that will create 500 new skilled jobs.New end-applications, such as industrial internet-of-things and autonomous vehicles, will continue to drive strong demand for semiconductors and present growth opportunities for Singapore. Under the Research Innovation Enterprise 2020 (RIE2020) Plan, we have set aside S$3.2 billion for Advanced Manufacturing & Engineering to support key industry sectors including Electronics. The Government has also been partnering companies in the adoption of advanced manufacturing technologies to increase productivity. For example, Infineon recently announced a S$105 million investment to transform its Singapore manufacturing facility into a Smart Factory, with automated guided vehicles to transport chips across the facility.The Government will continue to support our workforce to acquire the relevant skillsets to benefit from the new job opportunities. For instance, we are working closely with the industry, trade associations and unions to co-develop a Skills Framework for the Electronics industry, which will map out career pathways, job roles, requisite skills and wages. This framework will facilitate skills recognition, and support the design of targeted training programmes for skills and career development.These efforts are part of our Industry Transformation Map (ITM) to strengthen the competitiveness of the Electronics industry. The Electronics ITM will be launched later this year."
compulsory pre-market approval for health supplements,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry will consider compulsory pre-market approval or licensing of health supplements before they can be imported and sold in Singapore.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) applies a risk-based approach in the regulation of different categories of health products. Western pharmaceutical drugs are used mainly by healthcare practitioners in the treatment and prevention of diseases. They are regulated stringently as they are inherently more potent. Health supplements, on the other hand, are intended for enhancing a person's health. They are not meant to prevent, treat or cure diseases, or alleviate the symptoms of diseases. They generally contain well-established ingredients such as vitamins, minerals or substances derived from natural sources. As health supplements are generally of lower risk than western pharmaceutical drugs, they do not require approval by HSA before they can be sold locally. They can be purchased over the counter without medical supervision. Our regulatory approach for health supplements is similar to that adopted by the United States, European Union countries and Japan.We are mindful that introducing pre-market regulation for health supplements could result in companies passing on the regulatory cost to consumers or forgo introducing products into Singapore which has a small market size, thereby reducing consumer choice.Nevertheless, importers, wholesale dealers, sellers and manufacturers of health supplement are responsible for ensuring the safety and quality of their products. They must ensure that their products do not contain harmful substances or potent active ingredients used in western pharmaceutical drugs. Dealers must also ensure that product claims are truthful and not misleading, and that product advertisements do not make claims for treatment or prevention of diseases.HSA has in place a post market surveillance system to monitor the safety of health products including health supplements. Our healthcare professionals report adverse events to HSA. HSA also keeps a close watch on safety issues encountered in other countries. In addition, HSA routinely samples health supplements sold here and test them. Should there be any quality or safety concerns detected, HSA will take the necessary actions, including working with the companies to remove the products from sale or informing the public to stop consuming these products."
measures to ensure security of medical records of saf personnel,Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for Defence what measures have been undertaken to ensure the security of the medical records of SAF personnel in view of the integration via the internet of the SAF's electronic medical records system (the Patient Care Enhancement System (PACES)) with the National Electronic Health Record system.,"Dr Ng Eng Hen: Two main aspects to ensure security of medical records of servicemen were taken into account in the design and implementation of SAF's electronic medical records system. They relate primarily to one, the confidentiality of records and second, measures to guard against unauthorised access and cyber-intrusions. Stringent processes for these two aspects have been put in place, which are aligned with international standards.First, to ensure confidentiality of records, access to the SAF's electronic medical records system is limited only to medical personnel and selected Human Resource (HR) practitioners on a need-to basis and the list of authorised users is regularly reviewed. Even then, the level of access is also tiered based – medical officers as primary care-givers need to and can access detailed medical information, but medics and HR practitioners can access less information that is relevant to fulfil their functions. Regular audits are conducted to ensure that access and the confidentiality of the medical information have complied with existing policies and regulations and benchmarked to Ministry of Health's practices and standards.Second, to guard against unauthorised access and cyber-intrusions, PACES is only accessible to authorised users from designated terminals at specific MINDEF/SAF premises. The entire PACES system is also protected by a suite of tools to enhance cyber security. When medical information of SAF personnel is required for continuity of care to be shared with other medical institutions using the National Electronic Health Records (NEHR) system, it is first encrypted and transmitted via a dedicated point-to-point connection with system authentication.The SAF's electronic medical records system is regularly tested for vulnerabilities to update the system’s software. In addition, the system is constantly being monitored for any attempted cyber intrusions."
dental health among pre-primary children,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Health (a) whether dental health among pre-primary children has improved in the last 10 years; (b) whether HPB's oral care programmes for pre-primary children have been implemented for all early childhood education centres; and (c) whether the Ministry will make available free or subsidised initial dental check-ups for pre-primary children.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The oral health of our 12 year old children is ranked amongst the best in the world. However, the proportion of Primary 1 children with dental caries had increased slightly from 50.9% in 2007 to 53.1% in 2016, indicating that the dental health of pre-primary children has not improved in the last decade.Dental treatment for pre-primary children has been provided at nominal cost at Health Promotion Board (HPB)’s School Dental Centre since 1999, and HPB has been conducting oral health promotion in kindergartens and childcare centres since 2002. To address the rising trend of dental caries in Primary 1 children, HPB introduced the tooth-brushing programme with optimally fluoridated toothpaste in 2014, which has reached 1,026 childcare centres (out of 1279 childcare centres in 2016). Through this programme, HPB aims to raise awareness of the importance of using optimally-fluoridated toothpaste among parents, teachers and children, and inculcate effective tooth-brushing habits in children from young.Going forward, as an initiative under the NurtureSG Plan, HPB will move upstream to offer free oral health screening for pre-schoolers aged 3-4 years, to at least 800 childcare centres by 2019, and 1100 childcare centres by 2020."
average waiting time at a&e department at each public hospital,"Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for Health in each year from 2013, what is the average waiting time at the Accident and Emergency Department of each of our public hospitals for (i) emergency but non-life-threatening cases and (ii) admission to the hospital.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Patients at the emergency departments (EDs) are prioritised and attended to based on the severity of their conditions. All life-threatening (P1) cases are attended to immediately. For emergency but non-life-threatening (P2) cases, the median waiting times across the EDs averaged about 23 minutes, 22 minutes, 18 minutes and 17 minutes in 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 respectively.For patients who required admissions, the median waiting time for admission averaged about 2 hours, 2.3 hours, 2 hours and 1.6 hours in 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 respectively.Our hospitals have protocols to ensure care is not compromised despite high demand for ED services. Even while patients wait at the EDs for admission, medical teams continue to monitor them and institute appropriate investigations and treatments."
higher penalties for misleading claims in advertisements of health products and services,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry will consider higher penalties for such false and misleading claims in advertisements of health products and services so as to protect the interest of consumers.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Ministry of Health regulates advertisements of health products and services to protect consumers from false and misleading claims that may put their health at risk.Under the Health Products Act (HPA), any false and misleading advertisements will be liable to a maximum penalty of $20,000, imprisonment of up to 12 months or both.Some health products, including Chinese Proprietary Medicines and Traditional Medicines, are currently regulated under the Medicines Act (MA). The maximum penalty for any false and misleading advertisements under the MA is $5,000 fine, imprisonment of up to two years or both.We intend to amend the legislation to move the regulation of Chinese Proprietary Medicines and Traditional Medicines from the MA to HPA. The higher penalties under HPA will apply once the move is completed. We are also reviewing the Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act (PHMCA) to enhance the regulation of health services advertisements by healthcare institutions."
traffic summonses issued for non-compliance of yellow box rules in past three years,Mr Yee Chia Hsing asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) how many traffic summons have been issued for non-compliance of yellow box rules over the past three years; and (b) whether the Traffic Police can consider the use of traffic cameras to ensure compliance at busy junctions.,"Mr K Shanmugam: Between 2014 and 2016, Traffic Police (TP) issued on average about 450 traffic summonses each year to motorists who had stopped their vehicles in yellow boxes and caused obstruction to other road users.TP has deployed cameras to deter and detect serious traffic offences such as red-light running and speeding. We do not rule out using cameras for other types of offences in the future, if the need arises."
mandatory maternity leave for female employees,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Prime Minister whether the Ministry has plans to review and increase the length of mandatory maternity leave for female employees.,"Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): The Government is strongly committed to supporting Singaporeans in their aspirations to marry and raise families. Leave is one of the range of measures to support parents to better manage their work and family commitments.Legislated leave provisions have been progressively enhanced over the years to strengthen this support. In particular, paid Maternity Leave was increased in 2004 from eight weeks to 12 weeks, and this was further extended to 16 weeks in 2008.We have also increased leave provisions to encourage fathers to play a more active role in caring for their children. Most recently, we have legislated two weeks of Paternity Leave from 1 January 2017, and from 1 July 2017, Shared Parental Leave will be raised to four weeks from one week currently. This will give working parents more flexibility to decide on the allocation of leave that best suits their caregiving needs.The Government will be testing the viability of longer parental leave through a pilot scheme in the public sector. At the recent Committee of Supply debate, we announced that the Public Service will provide an additional four weeks of unpaid infantcare leave per parent, to be taken within the child’s first year. The pilot will last for three years, to allow us to test the impact of longer parental leave in a variety of work settings, and assess whether a nation-wide rollout is practicable in future.Given these recent enhancements, we do not plan to increase our legislated leave provisions for parents, including mandatory Maternity Leave, at this point in time. This is to give employers more time to adjust to the leave provisions which come into effect this year.At the same time, employers and co-workers play important roles in shaping a family-friendly workplace culture. Employers can tap on various resources to do so, including the WorkPro Work-Life Grant administered by the Ministry of Manpower, which provides up to $160,000 to help companies defray the costs of developing, piloting and sustaining flexible work arrangements (FWAs). Employers can also refer to the Tripartite Advisory on FWAs published by the tripartite partners, which guides companies and supervisors along the journey of introducing and sustaining FWAs in their workplaces."
ways for smes to export their brands and operations overseas,"Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Trade) how can SMEs better utilise overseas larger scale Singapore companies-led projects such as malls and industrial parks in China and Vietnam, to export their brands and operations.","Mr Lim Hng Kiang: Large scale projects such as malls and industrial parks led by Singapore companies help lower the barriers for SMEs to access overseas markets. SMEs would tend to be familiar with the project developers, and the projects would typically provide a more familiar ecosystem for the SMEs.IE Singapore actively partners Singapore project developers to bring Singapore SMEs into the overseas projects and industrial parks. For example, IE and Capitaland have been working on the Datansha Urban Renewal Project in Guangzhou to bring on board Singapore SMEs. These SMEs have been able to adapt and innovate to offer value-added products and services that address specific niches in-market. They include SMEs like Singapore Garden City and Orange Valley, which offer specialised and differentiated architectural and landscaping design, and eldercare services respectively.In Vietnam, SMEs are already accessing the market through the seven Vietnam-Singapore Industrial Parks (VSIPs) co-developed by SembCorp. As VSIP tenants include local enterprises and international corporations, SMEs can tap on this network to seek complementarities and customise their production to meet market demand. For example, Singapore companies in the food industry have set up in VSIP 1 in Binh Duong province to cater to the growing middle class and expanding appetite for premium food products.IE Singapore will continue to facilitate partnerships between SMEs and large scale projects led by Singapore companies, to help SMEs scale up and establish themselves in overseas markets."
falls from personal mobility devices and progress of safe cycling programmes for students,Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for Transport in light of a significant number of children sustaining fractures through falls from personal mobility devices (PMDs) (a) what is the progress of safe cycling programmes for students; (b) whether this programme covers all types of PMDs; and (c) how many cases of injuries arising from falls from PMDs have been treated at government hospitals or polyclinics in the past two years.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The Land Transport Authority (LTA) has reached out to more than 70,000 primary school students via publications. Last year, it also conducted a pilot Safe Riding Programme (SRP) in four schools. The pilot was very well received. LTA is in the process of appointing training providers to conduct the programme at more schools this year.The SRP covers the use of personal mobility devices (PMDs). It teaches users how to manoeuvre their PMD when they encounter different situations. As there are many different types of PMD in the market, the programme participants are required to have at least basic ability in using their device. New PMD users could approach their retailer for such basic training.Government hospitals and polyclinics do not maintain statistics on injuries that arise from falls from PMDs."
tampering of odometers of vehicles,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for Transport whether there are plans to legislate against the tampering of odometers of vehicles in view of customers being sold secondhand vehicles with misrepresented mileage readings.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Tampering with odometer readings with the intent to deceive potential buyers is already an offence under the Penal Code. Furthermore, if a motor dealer is aware that an odometer has been tampered with, but fails to disclose this to the buyer, he can be investigated for unfair practices under the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act. Affected buyers may approach the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) for assistance."
plans to manage dust and noise pollution from enhancement works for tampines expressway,"Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Transport with regard to the enhancement works being undertaken for the Tampines Expressway, what are the near and long-term mitigating plans to manage the dust and noise pollution arising from these works.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: During construction, LTA and its contractors will install temporary noise barriers, enclose noisy machinery and schedule noisy works during the day. They will water the work areas periodically and wash construction vehicles before they leave the work site to minimise dust pollution."
affordability of infant formula,Mr Low Thia Khiang asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) what is being done to ensure that the cost of infant formula remains affordable.,"Mr S Iswaran: The Health Promotion Board (HPB) and international organisations including the World Health Organisation (WHO), strongly encourage breastfeeding as it can provide the nutritional needs of infants, with the added benefits of promoting mother-child bonding. In some cases, infants cannot be exclusively breastfed and will need infant formula. All infant formula sold in Singapore, regardless of price, meets Singapore's Food Regulations and the nutritional needs for infants to grow healthily.Some infant formula companies give the impression that their particular brands of milk powder can do more. The scientific evidence for this is weak. Without better information, parents rely on the claims made by infant formula companies, or are misled into using price as a proxy for the quality of the product.Public awareness is important to support parents in deciding what is best for their children. HPB, together with healthcare institutions and healthcare professionals, will get the message out, especially to mothers-to-be.All hospitals, both public and private, encourage and support breastfeeding. They will provide infant formula when needed. The Ministry of Health (MOH) will work with industry players to make available more infant formula options in hospitals to enhance market competition.All public hospitals offering maternity services are already Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI)-certified today, but private hospitals have yet to come on board. BFHI-certified hospitals are committed to actively encourage and support breastfeeding targets, and are not allowed to enter into sponsorship arrangements with milk powder companies.The Competition Commission of Singapore (CCS) recently completed a market study which examined the formula milk industry in Singapore, and the nature of competition at each level of the supply chain. It will publish its report this week. Should there be any evidence of companies acting in concert to increase prices together, CCS will investigate the anti-competitive behaviour under the Competition Act.There are several measures that can be taken together to encourage greater price competition between brands. The Government will simplify and streamline import requirements, as well as remove unnecessary barriers to entry in order to bring in more options for parents, without compromising food safety.HPB is supporting a review of the Sale of Infant Food Ethics Committee, Singapore (SIFECS) Code of Ethics which will include extending its coverage to all infant formula for infants up to 12 months of age. The Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) will tighten its regulations on labelling and advertising further.MTI and other Government agencies such as MOH, HPB, and AVA will increase consumer awareness, encourage good practices in hospitals, facilitate more formula milk options, and further tighten regulations on labelling and advertising further. The Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) will also remind businesses to price their products fairly, and look into consumer feedback on potential profiteering."
gender budgeting to determine effect of policies on women,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Finance whether the Government practises gender budgeting to determine the effect of policies on women, especially with regard to fertility and labour force participation rates and, if so, for which policies.","Mr Heng Swee Keat: Gender budgeting is an analytical tool to ensure gender-sensitive public resource allocation so as to achieve gender equality in the distribution and impact of government budgets. In the design, planning, and delivery of programmes in Singapore, we take into account the impact of our policies on different segments of the population, including gender, and target benefits at those in need.Our policies over the years have enabled the advancement of women. Our system is underpinned by meritocracy. We invest heavily in education for all, achieving high participation rates in tertiary education among both men and women. To encourage families to have children and to support working mothers, we have made quality pre-school more affordable and accessible, introduced the Work-Life Grant to encourage flexible work arrangements, and enhanced parental leave provisions.There has been steady progress in the advancement of women in Singapore. Over the past 10 yearsa. In the area of education, amongst resident females aged 25 to 34 years old, 80% had tertiary qualifications in 2016, up from 62% in 2006.b. The employment rate of women aged 25 to 64 years old has increased from 63% in 2006 to 72% in 2016. This has brought us from 23rd compared to OECD countries, to 12th.c. Women’s full-time median wage has grown by 5.3% per annum from 2006 to 2016, at a similar rate to that of men.d. The proportion of employees working in establishments with ad-hoc flexible work arrangements increased from 76% in 2015 to 82% in 2016. This benefits not only women, but all workers.Our laws also protect and advance the rights of women and girls in Singapore. The Women's Charter, introduced in 1961, provided for monogamy, gave equal rights and responsibilities over the care of children and home, entitled the wife to maintenance and a share of the matrimonial property, and provided protection against domestic violence. Since then, we have improved specific protections for women, including the enhancement of the protection of workers' maternity leave benefits in 2013, and the amendment of the Women's Charter in 2011 to address divorce and maintenance enforcement issues.There are other laws which, while gender-neutral, benefit women in particular, for example the Protection from Harassment Act, the Family Justice Act, and the Employment Act, as women are more likely to face harassment or workplace discrimination.More details of our efforts towards building an environment where there are equal opportunities for women and men are available in the regular reports that the Singapore Government has been submitting to the United Nations' Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) since 2000."
reasons for increasing number of families receiving comcare help,Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what is the reason for the increasing number of families receiving ComCare help particularly among senior citizens when mean wages and household income have been increasing; (b) whether this trend indicates widening income gaps; and (c) what measures can be taken to address this trend.,"Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: Over the last few years, MSF has enhanced the coverage and accessibility of ComCare assistance to help households in need. We have set up the network of 24 Social Service Offices (SSOs) island-wide. We have also revised the income criteria of our help schemes. With these enhancements, more low-income families have benefited from ComCare assistance.At the same time, the demographic profile in Singapore has been changing, with trends such as smaller families, rising number of single-person households and ageing population observed. These factors affect the ability of some families to cope, and they may require temporary financial assistance to address their needs.The increasing number of households on ComCare assistance does not necessarily indicate a widening income gap. Over the last five years, the Gini Coefficient remained relatively stable, at 0.473 in 2011 and 0.458 in 2016. The Government has also provided additional transfers such as Silver Support and Medishield Life premium subsidies to help lower-income Singaporeans. This is reflected in the lower Gini Coefficient of 0.402 in 2016 after Government taxes and transfers.Our SSOs work closely with FSCs, other government agencies and community partners to provide holistic support. For example, our SSOs partner Workforce Singapore (WSG) and the Employment and Employability Institute (e2i) to provide the client with employment assistance to improve his or her employability and secure stable employment. Seniors in need can also benefit from Government-funded social services such as Senior Activity Centres, befriending and counselling services. The Silver Support Scheme under the Manpower Ministry provides an income supplement to seniors who had low incomes through life and who now have little or no family support.Beyond ComCare, we are also expanding upstream intervention to strengthen the resilience of vulnerable families and their children to set a good foundation. This includes supporting vulnerable children in their early years, encouraging work and helping workers level up their skills. We also recognise the importance of financial planning for the low-income, and will continue to review efforts for this group."
criteria for approval of coe/arf waivers for drivers with disabilities,Ms Chia Yong Yong asked the Minister for Social and Family Development what are the criteria for the approval of COE/ARF waivers for drivers with disabilities.,"Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: The Disabled Persons Scheme (DPS) was set up in 1980 when transport options for persons with disabilities were limited. The DPS supports Singapore Citizens with permanent disabilities from the lower income groups who are unable to use public transport (i.e. bus and/or MRT) without assistance and require a vehicle to perform their work functions. Eligible drivers with disabilities are exempted from paying premiums for the certificates of entitlement (COE) and the additional registration fees (ARF) when they purchase a vehicle. It is a means-tested scheme.To qualify for the scheme, persons with disabilities must be certified by a medical doctor from the Tan Tock Seng Rehabilitation Centre to be permanently disabled and incapable of travelling by public transport. They must also be gainfully employed and demonstrate the need for a vehicle in performing their work functions, such as frequent travelling to worksites or to meet clients. Applicants would also need to meet the means-test criteria.In addition to the DPS scheme, persons with disability who wish to own their own vehicle are also supported with loan arrangements. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) exempts the physically disabled from the financing restrictions on motor vehicle loans granted by financial institutions such as the maximum loan-to-value (LTV) of 50% or 60% of the purchase price depending on the open market value (OMV) of the vehicle.There are also other alternatives for travel of persons with permanent disabilities who are medically certified to be unable to take public transport. These individuals can tap on the Taxi Subsidy Scheme (TSS), which provides means-tested taxi subsidies to defray the cost of commute to school or work. The scheme also supports booking of taxis for ease of pick-up from the homes of the persons with disabilities. The TSS is an alternative to owning a vehicle for the purpose of transport.The DPS and TSS complement public transport options to facilitate independent travel and living for persons with disabilities. We will continue to work with relevant agencies to enhance accessibility and availability of affordable transport options for persons with disabilities."
demand for residential homes for elderly,Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) whether any study has been done to gauge the demand for residential homes for the elderly as an option to living in nursing homes; and (b) whether there are plans to build such residential homes especially for those who are living alone.,"Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: From 2014 to 2015, MOH had engaged over 4,000 Singaporeans on their aspirations and ideas on how the Government can help Singaporeans age well to develop the Action Plan for Successful Ageing. Seniors shared that they prefer to age in place in their own homes, surrounded by their loved ones in the community.HDB has provided more housing options for seniors, such as 2-room flexi flats. MOH complements these housing options by integrating care services with it. In selected new housing estates, MOH is working to co-design and co-locate nursing homes and eldercare facilities within the public housing precinct so that we have a continuum of independent living, assisted and nursing care facilities within the same precinct.We also need to inject services within existing HDB precincts to help seniors age in place. MOH is on track to reach their target of 6,200 day care places and 10,000 home care places by 2020. MOH is also piloting Integrated Home and Day Care packages to allow seniors to benefit from a flexible mix of home and day care services tailored to suit their needs.For vulnerable seniors, MSF has set up 19 Senior Cluster Networks to coordinate and integrate services. These networks comprise 69 Senior Activity Centres and 19 case management teams across the island, to reach out to low-income and vulnerable seniors to stay engaged and prevent social isolation. MSF has also set up Senior Group Homes to support frail elderly in rental flats to age within the community, as an alternative to living in nursing homes.MSF and MOH will continue to provide a range of home and community-based social and care support, and review services regularly to ensure that seniors with diverse needs are able to age gracefully in familiar surroundings."
singaporeans below 35 on social welfare in 2016,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what is the number of Singaporeans below the age of 35 who are on social welfare in 2016; (b) whether this has been an increasing trend in the past 10 years; and (c) what are the plans to deal with the underlying issues and problems for such group of persons.,"Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: The number of households with main applicant aged below 35 that received ComCare Short-to-Medium Term Assistance (SMTA) increased from 4,016 in FY2012 to 5,644 in FY2015. As a proportion of households receiving ComCare SMTA, this dipped slightly from 19.5% in FY2012 to 19.1% in FY2015. More households had received assistance due to the revised income criteria. More families can also access assistance through the network of 24 Social Service Offices (SSOs) island wide.Some younger applicants may be temporarily unemployed and searching for a job. Besides providing financial assistance, our SSOs partner Workforce Singapore (WSG) and the Employment and Employability Institute (e2i) to provide the client with employment assistance to improve his or her employability and secure stable employment.Other families may have more complex needs, for example family issues such as divorce, health issues or incarceration. To address this, our SSOs work with community partners such as Family Service Centres to help these families strengthen their family ties and develop resilience. To support the needs of different couples, including young couples, MSF partners community agencies to provide marriage preparation and support programmes. MSF also works with other agencies to enhance preventive and upstream strategies for low-income groups, such as financial literacy, employment and housing support.We are also expanding upstream efforts to support vulnerable families and their children. To this end, the Early Childhood Development Agency has piloted the KidSTART programme in July last year to enable children aged six and below from low-income and vulnerable families to have a good start in life."
long-term plan to help lower-income singaporean families defray high cost of infant formula,"Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for Social and Family Development whether the Ministry plans to assist lower-income Singaporean families to cope with the high cost of infant formula on a permanent basis either through the expansion of, or in addition to, schemes like the NTUC Fairprice Foundation-CDC Milk Fund that was recently launched.","24 Mr Low Thia Khiang asked the Minister for Social and Family Development whether there are plans to provide sustained help to low-income families to assist them in defraying the cost of buying infant formula over the longer term.Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: Families may tap on the Baby Bonus Cash Gift to defray their child-raising costs. Parents with a Singapore citizen child born on or after 1 January 2015 will receive $8,000 for the first and second child, and $10,000 for the third and subsequent child. These amounts include the Baby Bonus Plus of $2,000, which was introduced in 2015. The Baby Bonus Cash Gift is disbursed in five instalments over 18 months following the child’s birth, providing parents with sustained support during the child’s infancy.We acknowledge community efforts, such as the NTUC FairPrice Foundation-CDC Milk Fund, to assist families. Vulnerable, low-income families who face difficulties coping with their daily living expenses can approach their nearest Social Service Office (SSO) to apply for ComCare Short-to-Medium Term Assistance.The SSO will conduct a needs assessment and families may receive a monthly cash grant to assist with their basic needs. The cash assistance will take into account the costs of infant formula milk, in the case of vulnerable families with infants. We will continue to monitor the cost of infant formula milk and review our social assistance schemes as needed."
plans for adequate childcare and kindergarten facilities in bidadari estate,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for Social and Family Development whether the Ministry has plans for adequate childcare and kindergarten facilities to be located within Bidadari estate.,"Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: The Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) works closely with the Housing Development Board (HDB) to plan for pre-schools in upcoming Build-To-Order (BTO) developments, including Bidadari new town. To better meet the needs of young parents, new pre-schools will have larger capacities and also be completed earlier where possible.ECDA also works with HDB to integrate pre-schools with the BTO precincts to provide more accessible services to the young families moving into the estate. Centres may also have access to common greens and community facilities such as playgrounds, which provides opportunities for physical and outdoor activities that enhance children’s well-being and development."
government response to recommendations in health insurance task force 2016 report,"Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the Ministry has completed its study of the recommendations in the report of the Health Insurance Task Force 2016 so as to moderate the escalation of Integrated Shield Plan claims and premiums in the coming years; and (b) if not, when does the Ministry plan to respond to the report.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Health Insurance Task Force (HITF) report made several recommendations to manage escalation in healthcare costs and insurance premiums.We are reviewing the recommendations and discussing with relevant stakeholders. These require support from healthcare providers, insurers and patients. All stakeholders need to work together to achieve a sustainable healthcare system for Singapore."
first-year jc enrolment for 2013-2017 and projected enrolment for 2019,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Education (Schools) (a) what has been the enrolment of first-year junior college students for the years 2013-2017; and (b) what is the projected enrolment for first year junior college students for 2019.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: The number of first-year junior college students from 2013 to 2017 is as follows:The decrease over this period is due to falling birth rates, with the exception of 2017, which corresponds to the 2000 dragon year cohort.The projected enrolment for first-year junior college students for 2019 is about 12,800."
statistics on psle cohorts and their progression to alternative qualifications,"Mr Darryl David asked the Minister for Education (Schools) for the past five years (a) what is the number of students for each PSLE cohort; and (b) what is the percentage of students in each PSLE cohort who go on to take alternative qualifications, such as the Integrated Programme or International Baccalaureate diploma, instead of the GCE ""O"" Level examinations.","Mr Ng Chee Meng: The number of students who sat for the PSLE from 2012 to 2016 is below.The Integrated Programme (IP) is a 6-year programme that culminates in the GCE A-Levels, the International Baccalaureate (IB) or the NUS High School of Mathematics and Science Diploma. Students in IP do not sit for the GCE O-Levels.MOE has planned the IP intake to be able to cater to about 10% of the PSLE cohort each year, starting in the early years of the IP expansion with a smaller percentage and gradually expanding this to reach about 8% in the 2012 PSLE cohort and 10% in the 2016 PSLE cohort."
programmes to teach students to discern fake news,"Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for Education (Schools) (a) whether there are programmes to teach students how to discern fake news; (b) if so, how are the programmes designed and rolled out; and (c) if not, whether there are plans to develop and roll out such programmes in a specific timeline.","Mr Ng Chee Meng: ""Communication, Collaboration and Information Skills"" is one set of the 21st century competencies that MOE develops in our students. It includes the development of information literacy, which refers to the ability to create digital products, connect with others to learn and work with digital information, and curate digital resources and critically discern its authenticity.In schools, information literacy is infused into a variety of subjects like English, History and Social Studies where there are lessons that teach students to critically evaluate different sources of information, both online and offline during information search. Teachers guide students in distinguishing fact from opinion, applying logic and verifying the authority of sources. Students are taught to cross-check the information and views presented with other sources to determine their trustworthiness and usefulness for drawing substantiated conclusions.Information literacy is also taught in the Cyber Wellness (CW) syllabus for primary and secondary schools as part of the Character and Citizenship Education curriculum. Students are nurtured to be safe and responsible users of digital space by learning how to verify the credibility and authenticity of online information sources and refraining from sharing unverified posts.To further reinforce the learning from the Cyber Wellness lessons, schools are provided with timely teaching and learning resources on the latest cyber trends and issues which include real-life case-studies and tips to raise awareness on online misinformation. Teachers, for instance, are given tips on how to nurture students to be discerning of the things they read online to avoid falling prey to scams and fake news. Schools are also regularly provided with CW resources to engage parents as our partners to educate their child to be discerning users of digital space."
"fees charged to international students studying in government schools, colleges, polytechnics and ites","Mr Ong Teng Koon asked the Minister for Education (Schools) whether the fees charged to international students in primary schools, secondary schools, junior colleges, polytechnics and institutes of technical education reflect the full cost of the education system or only take into account the direct operating costs of the school.","Mr Ng Chee Meng: As the priority of our education system is to provide a quality education for students who are Singapore Citizens (SCs), fees are differentiated by nationality across our publicly-funded education system to reflect the privileges of citizenship, from primary schools to university. International Students (ISes) pay the highest fees, followed by Singapore Permanent Residents (SPRs), and SCs. The fees for ISes are much higher than those for SCs and SPRs.However, in determining the various fees to be charged, we may not charge the total costs incurred in running these programmes. We would also take into consideration other factors, such as the benefits that ISes can bring to our schools, institutions, and students. ISes add to the diversity and vibrancy in our schools and institutions, and provide opportunities for our SC and SPR students to interact and develop the cross-cultural skills and versatility needed for the global workplace in the future."
"percentage of international students studying in government schools, colleges, polytechnics and ites","Mr Ong Teng Koon asked the Minister for Education (Schools) what is the percentage of international students studying in primary schools, secondary schools, junior colleges, polytechnics and institutes of technical education.","Mr Ng Chee Meng: Out of the total enrolment in our national schools (Primary Schools, Secondary Schools and Junior Colleges), around 5% are international students.International students make up around 1% of full-time students in ITE and less than 10% of full-time students in the Polytechnics."
accommodation not covered under foreign employee dormitories act,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what percentage of workers are living in accommodation not covered under the Foreign Employee Dormitories Act; and (b) what steps are being taken to ensure that these accommodation that fall outside the Foreign Employee Dormitories Act are of equivalent standards to larger dormitories.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: As of March 2017, about one-third of Work Permit Holders residing in Singapore live in foreign employee dormitories licensed under the Foreign Employee Dormitories Act (FEDA), which imposes additional conditions appropriate to the higher concentration risks posed by large dormitories. The remaining two-thirds live in other smaller accommodation types, such as Factory Converted Dormitories (FCDs), HDB Flats, and Private Residential Premises.Smaller accommodation types which are not covered under the FEDA are nonetheless still required to comply with a set of comprehensive regulations and requirements imposed by various agencies, to ensure a safe and well-maintained living space for foreign workers. They include standards for building structural safety governed by the Building and Construction Authority (BCA), fire safety governed by the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF), as well as proper and adequate sanitary facilities governed by the National Environment Agency (NEA). Once all approvals have been obtained, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) will then grant the owner of the premises with permission to operate a workers’ dormitory.To ensure these accommodation are of comparable standards to larger dormitories, we take three approaches. First, the Government regularly reviews standards across all types of foreign workers’ accommodation, taking into account the unique nature of each type. Where appropriate, the minimum standards will be raised to improve the well-being of foreign workers. For example, MOM has required operators of Factory Converted Dormitories (FCDs) to comply with additional conditions from 1 January 2017, including the provision of Wi-Fi and a sickbay. The Ministry also works closely with various agencies such as NEA, URA and SCDF to conduct routine and ad-hoc inspections.Second, in addition to looking into complaints of poor housing, we also conduct proactive inspections. From 2014 to 2016, MOM conducted close to 4,000 foreign worker housing inspections. MOM ramped up our housing inspections from 700 in 2014 to 1,800 in 2016. Third, enforcement actions are taken against employers and/or dormitory operators who fail to comply with our regulations and requirements."
asian nursing scholarship recipients and their performance,"Ms K Thanaletchimi asked the Minister for Health (a) to date, how many Asian Nursing Scholarships (ANS) have been awarded; (b) how many scholars have (i) failed their exams (ii) failed their employment probation while serving their bonds (iii) absconded without completing their course and (iv) absconded without fulfilling their bonds after graduation; (c) whether the effectiveness of the ANS and selection criteria of the candidates will be reviewed to ensure that they write and speak good English; and (d) whether the Ministry will make it a pre-requisite for ANS applicants to have a good command of the English language.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: With Singapore's ageing population, we need more nurses to meet our growing healthcare needs. Introduced in 1994, the Asian Nursing Scholarship sponsors good students from Asian countries to pursue nursing studies in our polytechnics and supplement our nursing workforce upon graduation.Between 1994 and 2016, an average of about 200 Asian Nursing Scholarships were awarded a year. Less than 1% of scholarship holders were unable to complete their studies or absconded before completing their studies. Less than 3% did not fully serve out their bond after completing their studies, including those who have absconded.We will continue to work with the relevant authorities to attempt to recover the liquidated damages.Information on the number of scholars who started work but failed their work probation are available from the 2013 intake cohort onwards. Thus far, none of the 301 scholarship holders from the cohort has failed work probation. It should be noted that some of them are still in their probation period. Subsequent cohorts have yet to start their work probation.Applicants for the ANS need to meet the polytechnics' academic requirements, of which English is one of the required subjects. Some may be asked to undergo additional selection tests and interviews to assess their English proficiency. We monitor the performance of the scholars closely. Those who have difficulties coping will be counselled and given closer support.The ANS programme has helped develop a pool of locally-trained foreign nurses to supplement our local nursing manpower supply. We will continue to review the programme regularly to enhance its effectiveness."
contingency plans in event of closure of private clinic groups providing government-subsidised primary care,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Health whether there are any private clinic groups providing Government-subsidised primary care that are considered too big to fail by the Ministry and what contingency plans for continuity of care does the Ministry have if any of these groups experience extended temporary closures that do not amount to ceasing operation, or let, sell or in any way dispose of its medical clinics.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: There are many providers in our private primary care sector, comprising solo practitioners as well as medical practice groups of varying sizes. No single provider dominates the private primary care market.MOH encourages clinics to keep their patients informed of temporary closures. If the closure is for an extended period, the clinic should refer their patients to other clinics appropriately to ensure continuity of care. In the event when the clinic is unable to refer patients out, MOH will facilitate the referrals to other clinics and polyclinic(s) in the area, if necessary. Regardless of whether the closure is temporary or permanent, MOH will work with affected clinic(s) to ensure continuity of care for patients.Clinics are required to keep proper records of patient clinical information under the Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act. To facilitate better portability of such information, MOH is stepping up efforts to encourage more medical clinics to be linked to the National Electronic Health Records (NEHR) system including through providing grants for GP clinics to adopt GPConnect, an integrated IT solution which provides seamless connection with the NEHR.In the event of a clinic sale or transfer, an application for transfer of licensee will have to be made to MOH no less than 30 days before the planned day of the sale or transfer. MOH will conduct inspections and other checks to ensure that the safety and quality of clinical care to patients will not be affected."

statistics on vehicles booked for smoky emissions,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) in the past two years, how many vehicles with smoky emissions have been booked; (b) how many of these vehicles are foreign-registered; and (c) how are smoky foreign vehicles checked and turned away at the Checkpoints.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The National Environment Agency (NEA) conducts daily enforcement operations against smoky vehicles at both the Woodlands and Tuas checkpoints, as well as along major roads in Singapore. In 2015 and 2016, a total of 16,755 smoky vehicles were fined. Out of these, 6,339 smoky vehicles were foreign-registered.Smoky foreign vehicles spotted entering Singapore will be stopped for a ‘free acceleration’ smoke test. Drivers of diesel vehicles that emit smoke exceeding 40 Hartridge Smoke Units (HSU) and petrol vehicles with visible exhaust will be fined. Beyond the fine, diesel vehicles that emit excessive smoke exceeding 70 HSU will be turned back. In 2015 and 2016, 390 smoky foreign vehicles were turned back at the Checkpoints.Members of the public who spot smoky vehicles are encouraged to inform NEA via their hotline (1800-2255-632), online feedback form at the NEA website or the ""myEnv"" mobile application."
conversion or bridging programmes for non-ministry kindergarten teachers to gain access to ministry's kindergartens,Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for Education (Schools) whether there are conversion or bridging programmes to allow kindergarten teachers who are currently not under the Ministry's group of early childhood educators to gain access to join the Ministry's kindergartens so as to expand the pool of qualified early childhood educators at these kindergartens.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: To date, there are 15 MOE Kindergartens (MKs) and three more will open in 2018. Like other pre-school operators, MOE employs experienced pre-school educators from the sector, as well as fresh graduates from early childhood education courses (e.g. Diploma in Early Childhood Studies from Temasek Polytechnic). There is no need for conversion or bridging programmes for qualified pre-school educators crossing over from the other pre-schools to MKs.To increase the recruitment pool of MK educators, MOE has partnered Ngee Ann Polytechnic to run the full-time Diploma (Conversion) in Early Childhood Teaching programme, targeted at mid-careerists who do not have the requisite qualifications in early childhood education, to prepare them for their role as MK educators.MOE will continue its efforts in attracting and retaining good MK educators."
compensation from shipping companies to fish farm owners affected by oil spill in january 2017,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether any of the fish farm owners affected by the oil spill in January this year have received compensation from the shipping companies thus far; (b) what measures are being taken by AVA to address the time delay associated with the claims process; and (c) when is the expected date by which the compensation will be paid.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: An insurance claim process is a private matter between the claimant and the insurer. The duration of the process depends on the complexity of each claim and the negotiations between the relevant parties. It is the same in this case where the affected farmers are engaging directly with the relevant insurers.That said, AVA has made additional efforts to help farmers affected by the January oil spill with their claims. For example, AVA helped affected farmers submit their claims and arranged a meeting for the affected farmers to seek clarification from the relevant insurers about their claims. We understand that some farmers have already received compensation."
reason for non-inclusion of rabbits in recent revision of licensing for pet businesses,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for National Development (a) why are rabbits not included in the recent revision of licensing for pet businesses; and (b) whether AVA will consider the inclusion of rabbits.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: AVA takes a risk-based approach in the licensing of animals as pets. Hence it requires licensing for dogs, which are the most common cause of transmission of rabies from animals to humans. For rabbits, AVA requires pet shops to do pre-sale screenings to assess and ensure that their customers will be suitable pet owners. Following the recent revisions to pet shop and pet farm licensing conditions pertaining to dogs and cats, AVA will continue to work with stakeholders to review other licensing conditions, including those related to rabbits."
unsuccessful bto flat applications in 2016,"Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for National Development in 2016, what is the number of unsuccessful Build-To-Order (BTO) applications for the following categories (i) first-timer (ii) second-timer and (iii) third-timer or more.","Mr Lawrence Wong: The number of unsuccessful BTO applicants in 2016 is not available as the selection process is still on-going.Nonetheless, most first-timer families who apply for a BTO flat in the non-mature estates today should be able to book a flat within their first or second try, and definitely on their third try. Families are generally not eligible to purchase BTO flats from HDB beyond two times."
percentage of total land area designated for residential development taken up by hdb public housing and private condominiums from 2013-2016,"Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for National Development from 2013 to 2016, out of the total land area designated for residential development, what is the percentage of land area that is designated for HDB public housing and private condominiums respectively.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Between 2013 and 2016, URA granted planning approval for the development of (a) non-landed private residential units on 160 hectares (35%) of land, and (b) public housing units on 300 hectares (65%) of land."
"percentage of international students studying in government schools, colleges, polytechnics and ites","Mr Ong Teng Koon asked the Minister for Education (Schools) what is the percentage of international students studying in primary schools, secondary schools, junior colleges, polytechnics and institutes of technical education.","Mr Ng Chee Meng: Out of the total enrolment in our national schools (Primary Schools, Secondary Schools and Junior Colleges), around 5% are international students.International students make up around 1% of full-time students in ITE and less than 10% of full-time students in the Polytechnics."
affordability of infant formula,Mr Low Thia Khiang asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) what is being done to ensure that the cost of infant formula remains affordable.,"Mr S Iswaran: The Health Promotion Board (HPB) and international organisations including the World Health Organisation (WHO), strongly encourage breastfeeding as it can provide the nutritional needs of infants, with the added benefits of promoting mother-child bonding. In some cases, infants cannot be exclusively breastfed and will need infant formula. All infant formula sold in Singapore, regardless of price, meets Singapore's Food Regulations and the nutritional needs for infants to grow healthily.Some infant formula companies give the impression that their particular brands of milk powder can do more. The scientific evidence for this is weak. Without better information, parents rely on the claims made by infant formula companies, or are misled into using price as a proxy for the quality of the product.Public awareness is important to support parents in deciding what is best for their children. HPB, together with healthcare institutions and healthcare professionals, will get the message out, especially to mothers-to-be.All hospitals, both public and private, encourage and support breastfeeding. They will provide infant formula when needed. The Ministry of Health (MOH) will work with industry players to make available more infant formula options in hospitals to enhance market competition.All public hospitals offering maternity services are already Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI)-certified today, but private hospitals have yet to come on board. BFHI-certified hospitals are committed to actively encourage and support breastfeeding targets, and are not allowed to enter into sponsorship arrangements with milk powder companies.The Competition Commission of Singapore (CCS) recently completed a market study which examined the formula milk industry in Singapore, and the nature of competition at each level of the supply chain. It will publish its report this week. Should there be any evidence of companies acting in concert to increase prices together, CCS will investigate the anti-competitive behaviour under the Competition Act.There are several measures that can be taken together to encourage greater price competition between brands. The Government will simplify and streamline import requirements, as well as remove unnecessary barriers to entry in order to bring in more options for parents, without compromising food safety.HPB is supporting a review of the Sale of Infant Food Ethics Committee, Singapore (SIFECS) Code of Ethics which will include extending its coverage to all infant formula for infants up to 12 months of age. The Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) will tighten its regulations on labelling and advertising further.MTI and other Government agencies such as MOH, HPB, and AVA will increase consumer awareness, encourage good practices in hospitals, facilitate more formula milk options, and further tighten regulations on labelling and advertising further. The Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) will also remind businesses to price their products fairly, and look into consumer feedback on potential profiteering."
gender budgeting to determine effect of policies on women,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Finance whether the Government practises gender budgeting to determine the effect of policies on women, especially with regard to fertility and labour force participation rates and, if so, for which policies.","Mr Heng Swee Keat: Gender budgeting is an analytical tool to ensure gender-sensitive public resource allocation so as to achieve gender equality in the distribution and impact of government budgets. In the design, planning, and delivery of programmes in Singapore, we take into account the impact of our policies on different segments of the population, including gender, and target benefits at those in need.Our policies over the years have enabled the advancement of women. Our system is underpinned by meritocracy. We invest heavily in education for all, achieving high participation rates in tertiary education among both men and women. To encourage families to have children and to support working mothers, we have made quality pre-school more affordable and accessible, introduced the Work-Life Grant to encourage flexible work arrangements, and enhanced parental leave provisions.There has been steady progress in the advancement of women in Singapore. Over the past 10 yearsa. In the area of education, amongst resident females aged 25 to 34 years old, 80% had tertiary qualifications in 2016, up from 62% in 2006.b. The employment rate of women aged 25 to 64 years old has increased from 63% in 2006 to 72% in 2016. This has brought us from 23rd compared to OECD countries, to 12th.c. Women’s full-time median wage has grown by 5.3% per annum from 2006 to 2016, at a similar rate to that of men.d. The proportion of employees working in establishments with ad-hoc flexible work arrangements increased from 76% in 2015 to 82% in 2016. This benefits not only women, but all workers.Our laws also protect and advance the rights of women and girls in Singapore. The Women's Charter, introduced in 1961, provided for monogamy, gave equal rights and responsibilities over the care of children and home, entitled the wife to maintenance and a share of the matrimonial property, and provided protection against domestic violence. Since then, we have improved specific protections for women, including the enhancement of the protection of workers' maternity leave benefits in 2013, and the amendment of the Women's Charter in 2011 to address divorce and maintenance enforcement issues.There are other laws which, while gender-neutral, benefit women in particular, for example the Protection from Harassment Act, the Family Justice Act, and the Employment Act, as women are more likely to face harassment or workplace discrimination.More details of our efforts towards building an environment where there are equal opportunities for women and men are available in the regular reports that the Singapore Government has been submitting to the United Nations' Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) since 2000."
asian nursing scholarship recipients and their performance,"Ms K Thanaletchimi asked the Minister for Health (a) to date, how many Asian Nursing Scholarships (ANS) have been awarded; (b) how many scholars have (i) failed their exams (ii) failed their employment probation while serving their bonds (iii) absconded without completing their course and (iv) absconded without fulfilling their bonds after graduation; (c) whether the effectiveness of the ANS and selection criteria of the candidates will be reviewed to ensure that they write and speak good English; and (d) whether the Ministry will make it a pre-requisite for ANS applicants to have a good command of the English language.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: With Singapore's ageing population, we need more nurses to meet our growing healthcare needs. Introduced in 1994, the Asian Nursing Scholarship sponsors good students from Asian countries to pursue nursing studies in our polytechnics and supplement our nursing workforce upon graduation.Between 1994 and 2016, an average of about 200 Asian Nursing Scholarships were awarded a year. Less than 1% of scholarship holders were unable to complete their studies or absconded before completing their studies. Less than 3% did not fully serve out their bond after completing their studies, including those who have absconded.We will continue to work with the relevant authorities to attempt to recover the liquidated damages.Information on the number of scholars who started work but failed their work probation are available from the 2013 intake cohort onwards. Thus far, none of the 301 scholarship holders from the cohort has failed work probation. It should be noted that some of them are still in their probation period. Subsequent cohorts have yet to start their work probation.Applicants for the ANS need to meet the polytechnics' academic requirements, of which English is one of the required subjects. Some may be asked to undergo additional selection tests and interviews to assess their English proficiency. We monitor the performance of the scholars closely. Those who have difficulties coping will be counselled and given closer support.The ANS programme has helped develop a pool of locally-trained foreign nurses to supplement our local nursing manpower supply. We will continue to review the programme regularly to enhance its effectiveness."
contingency plans in event of closure of private clinic groups providing government-subsidised primary care,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Health whether there are any private clinic groups providing Government-subsidised primary care that are considered too big to fail by the Ministry and what contingency plans for continuity of care does the Ministry have if any of these groups experience extended temporary closures that do not amount to ceasing operation, or let, sell or in any way dispose of its medical clinics.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: There are many providers in our private primary care sector, comprising solo practitioners as well as medical practice groups of varying sizes. No single provider dominates the private primary care market.MOH encourages clinics to keep their patients informed of temporary closures. If the closure is for an extended period, the clinic should refer their patients to other clinics appropriately to ensure continuity of care. In the event when the clinic is unable to refer patients out, MOH will facilitate the referrals to other clinics and polyclinic(s) in the area, if necessary. Regardless of whether the closure is temporary or permanent, MOH will work with affected clinic(s) to ensure continuity of care for patients.Clinics are required to keep proper records of patient clinical information under the Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act. To facilitate better portability of such information, MOH is stepping up efforts to encourage more medical clinics to be linked to the National Electronic Health Records (NEHR) system including through providing grants for GP clinics to adopt GPConnect, an integrated IT solution which provides seamless connection with the NEHR.In the event of a clinic sale or transfer, an application for transfer of licensee will have to be made to MOH no less than 30 days before the planned day of the sale or transfer. MOH will conduct inspections and other checks to ensure that the safety and quality of clinical care to patients will not be affected."
measures for early diagnostics and treatment to reduce need for hospital admissions,Ms Sun Xueling asked the Minister for Health what measures has the Ministry taken to encourage early medical diagnostics and treatment to reduce the need to ward patients and free up demand for hospital bed space.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Ministry of Health (MOH) has been working with healthcare providers to encourage early diagnostics and reduce unnecessary hospital admissions.First, hospitals provide quick and effective treatment to patients at the Accident and Emergency Department, and enable patients with less serious conditions to return home safely without requiring admission. We have increased the number of procedures which can be done in the outpatient setting or as day surgeries. We are also equipping community care providers to monitor and manage discharged patients, so that they can be cared for in the community without returning to the hospital.Next, we are strengthening primary care to provide medical diagnosis and treatment to patients closer to home. Many non-emergency conditions can be appropriately managed at a primary care setting supported by early diagnostic testing and treatment. Primary care doctors are also able to treat patients requiring minor procedures. We have introduced common escalation and referral protocols where patients may be directly referred for hospital-based tests to help with diagnosis and management.Third, we are encouraging more healthy living and disease screening programmes in the community. This facilitates early detection and management of chronic diseases and selected cancers.Together, these efforts help to improve patient well-being and keep our healthcare system sustainable over the longer term."
average waiting time for scans for suspected cancer patients at government hospitals,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the average waiting time for a patient who is suspected of suffering from cancer to get a scan at the Government hospitals; (b) what is the risk of the cancer metastasising during the waiting period of a week; and (c) what is the total number of PET-CT scan machines in the various Government hospitals.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: At our public hospitals, over 95% of patients with suspected cancers would be given an appointment within three weeks. Depending on his condition, the patient may subsequently require various further investigations including blood tests, biopsies or imaging investigations such as X-rays, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT) or Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography (PET-CT) scans.For patients with suspected cancer, the current waiting time for a CT or MRI scan for initial diagnosis at the National Cancer Centre on Singapore General Hospital Campus, the National University Hospital and Tan Tock Seng Hospital is within two weeks. For cases deemed urgent by doctors, these scans can be arranged within two to three days.For PET-CT specifically, there is one machine each at the Singapore General Hospital and the National University Hospital. PET-CT scans are only recommended as first line investigations for certain types of lymphomas, lung, breast and skin cancers. The current waiting time for cancer patients requiring PET-CT scans is within one week.For most cancers, there is a very low risk of rapid metastases over a three week time period."
unlicensed moneylending-related harassment cases,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) how many unlicensed moneylending (UML) related harassment cases have been reported in the past year; (b) how many cases have been investigated; and (c) how many people have been charged and sentenced for UML harassment.,"Mr K Shanmugam: UML-related harassment cases registered a 10-year low in 2016, falling by 20%, from 4,242 cases in 2015 to 3,375 cases in 2016.Police investigate all UML harassment reports.In 2016, 260 persons were charged and sentenced by the Courts for UML harassment.However, it will be difficult to compare the number of UML cases and the number of persons convicted, and seek to draw conclusions. Many UML offenders are responsible for multiple harassment cases. In addition, not all harassment cases will result in persons being charged or convicted in Court. The Police, in consultation with the Attorney-General's Chambers, consider a range of factors before deciding whether to prosecute an offender."
current average waiting times for dental service appointments in polyclinics,Mr Low Thia Khiang asked the Minister for Health (a) what are the current average waiting times in polyclinics to obtain an appointment slot for (i) simple dental services of a non-emergency nature and (ii) routine services such as scaling and polishing; and (b) how do these waiting times compare with the waiting times five years ago.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The dental appointment waiting times for non-emergency treatment at our polyclinics has declined over the past few years, from 6.4 months in 2013 to 5.0 months in 2016.Middle and lower income patients who are eligible for the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) have the additional option to seek dental treatment at any of the over 700 participating dental clinics."
government response to recommendations in health insurance task force 2016 report,"Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the Ministry has completed its study of the recommendations in the report of the Health Insurance Task Force 2016 so as to moderate the escalation of Integrated Shield Plan claims and premiums in the coming years; and (b) if not, when does the Ministry plan to respond to the report.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Health Insurance Task Force (HITF) report made several recommendations to manage escalation in healthcare costs and insurance premiums.We are reviewing the recommendations and discussing with relevant stakeholders. These require support from healthcare providers, insurers and patients. All stakeholders need to work together to achieve a sustainable healthcare system for Singapore."
first-year jc enrolment for 2013-2017 and projected enrolment for 2019,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Education (Schools) (a) what has been the enrolment of first-year junior college students for the years 2013-2017; and (b) what is the projected enrolment for first year junior college students for 2019.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: The number of first-year junior college students from 2013 to 2017 is as follows:The decrease over this period is due to falling birth rates, with the exception of 2017, which corresponds to the 2000 dragon year cohort.The projected enrolment for first-year junior college students for 2019 is about 12,800."
programmes to teach students to discern fake news,"Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for Education (Schools) (a) whether there are programmes to teach students how to discern fake news; (b) if so, how are the programmes designed and rolled out; and (c) if not, whether there are plans to develop and roll out such programmes in a specific timeline.","Mr Ng Chee Meng: ""Communication, Collaboration and Information Skills"" is one set of the 21st century competencies that MOE develops in our students. It includes the development of information literacy, which refers to the ability to create digital products, connect with others to learn and work with digital information, and curate digital resources and critically discern its authenticity.In schools, information literacy is infused into a variety of subjects like English, History and Social Studies where there are lessons that teach students to critically evaluate different sources of information, both online and offline during information search. Teachers guide students in distinguishing fact from opinion, applying logic and verifying the authority of sources. Students are taught to cross-check the information and views presented with other sources to determine their trustworthiness and usefulness for drawing substantiated conclusions.Information literacy is also taught in the Cyber Wellness (CW) syllabus for primary and secondary schools as part of the Character and Citizenship Education curriculum. Students are nurtured to be safe and responsible users of digital space by learning how to verify the credibility and authenticity of online information sources and refraining from sharing unverified posts.To further reinforce the learning from the Cyber Wellness lessons, schools are provided with timely teaching and learning resources on the latest cyber trends and issues which include real-life case-studies and tips to raise awareness on online misinformation. Teachers, for instance, are given tips on how to nurture students to be discerning of the things they read online to avoid falling prey to scams and fake news. Schools are also regularly provided with CW resources to engage parents as our partners to educate their child to be discerning users of digital space."
areas of focus identified by future nursing career review committee,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked the Minister for Health whether the principles of inter-professional education and practice will be incorporated into the three strategic areas of focus identified by the Future Nursing Career Review Committee in developing a future-ready nursing workforce.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Inter-professional education and practice are integral to our education and training of nurses. For example, degree nursing students at NUS have joint learning and training sessions with medical and pharmacy undergraduates on inter-professional communication and team work. They are also taught advance care planning with social work students. Nanyang Polytechnic organises an annual ""Inter-professional Day"" where students from health science disciplines, including nursing and social work, form teams to work on case scenarios and projects together. At our ITEs, students in nursing undergo simulations of team-based care comprising doctors and nurses. All nursing students will also experience team-based care during their clinical attachments in our public healthcare institutions. As part of continuing education and training efforts, doctors, nurses, pharmacists and allied health professionals in our public healthcare institutions will undergo joint training on areas such as crisis management, patient safety and emergency resuscitation. In addition, MOH has been sponsoring close to 50 in-employment nurses every year to undergo team-based skills training overseas.Going forward, the principles of inter-professional education and practice will be incorporated into the implementation of the three strategic areas of focus identified by the Future Nursing Career Review Committee. The first area of focus is care, which is about enabling nurses to focus more on patient care through job and process redesign. This will entail a streamlining of inter-professional and team-based processes to achieve better care and nursing productivity.The second area of focus is community, which is about strengthening community nursing. Community nurses will be equipped with nursing care competencies to meet patients’ needs by working with inter-professional teams at the primary, transitional, home, as well as long term care settings.The third area of focus is competency, which is about developing broad-based nursing competencies and preparing nurses to practise team-based care across different settings. This work will be undertaken by a Committee involving representatives from various professional groups in order to incorporate an inter-professional perspective in the review of the nursing education and training framework."
new features and utilisation rate of healthhub portal,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Health what are the new features of the HealthHub portal and its utilisation rate.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: HealthHub is a one-stop portal and mobile application developed by the Health Promotion Board (HPB). It provides a range of health related content, e-services and incentives that encourage Singaporeans to stay healthy. It also enables Singaporeans to access some of their personal health information.As of end January 2017, more than 84,000 Singaporeans have downloaded the HealthHub application. The HealthHub portal has an average of 530,000 page views per month.A new Caregiver Access module was introduced in 2016 to allow authorised caregivers to access the medical appointments and records of those whom they are taking care of. This assists caregivers in keeping records and tracking appointments for their loved ones, who can decide on the level of access granted to the caregivers.In April 2017, HPB will introduce a new Personal Health Management module, known as the HealthHub Track. This provides users with digital tools, including action plans, to monitor and manage their health. HPB will also introduce personalised and localised content to support pregnant women in their pregnancy journey. In September 2017, HPB will introduce a new Diabetes Risk Assessment tool that helps adults, especially younger ones aged 18 to 39 years, to assess their risk for undiagnosed diabetes."
impact of 2% budget cut on ministries and agencies from fy2017,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Finance whether the 2% cut in the budget caps for all Ministries and agencies from FY2017 onwards will result in hiring freezes or headcount reductions in the public service.,"Mr Heng Swee Keat: The 2% downward adjustment is applied on the budget caps of Ministries and Organs of State to reinforce the importance of spending prudently and effectively. Ministries and Organs of State are provided with (i) budget caps for ongoing functions under the block budget, and (ii) budget for specific projects on top of the block budget. The budget adjustment applies to the budget caps.Even with the budget adjustment, the total budget of Ministries and Organs of States will continue to grow partly due to the budget for specific projects funded on top of the block budget. Some savings from the budget adjustment will be channelled to projects that enhance service delivery to citizens and businesses.Agencies can decide for themselves how best to meet their objectives under the adjusted budget. MOF does not prescribe specific measures such as cutting particular programmes, hiring freezes or headcount reductions, because each agency faces a different operating context.Agencies are expected to prioritise and deliver their programmes and projects in the most effective manner. To manage the budget adjustment, some agencies may expand certain programmes while phasing out programmes which are no longer relevant. Other agencies may maintain the same programmes but use less resources."
classification of revenue earned from government land leases,"Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for Finance in respect of the revenue earned from leases of Government land, what is the cut-off lease duration (in months or years) that is used to distinguish between revenue that is classified as operating revenue and revenue that is classified as a capital receipt under Sales of Land.","Mr Heng Swee Keat: Under the Protection of Reserves Framework in the Constitution, revenue from the disposal of State land is protected as part of Singapore’s Past Reserves and not available to the Government for spending as operating revenue. State land is deemed to be disposed of when the Government issues freehold titles, or issues leasehold titles for a total period of ten years or more.Our approach of protecting State land, and revenue from land sales, as Past Reserves is fiscally prudent and responsible. It ensures that all budgeting and spending decisions by the Government are based on sustainable, regular revenue sources, including the Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC) from our Past Reserves. In this way, we guard against the possibility of a government attempting to sell land quickly, especially when there is a property boom, just to raise immediate revenues to spend more."
estimated incremental cost to extend health subsidies to long term visit pass holders for fy17/18,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Health what is the estimated incremental cost of extending health subsidies to all Long Term Visit Pass holders for FY17/18.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The subsidy framework for healthcare services is guided by a set of policy principles, which include differentiation by citizenship status. As we had previously explained in this House, Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents receive Government subsidies at public healthcare institutions, with citizens receiving a higher level of subsidies. To support Singaporeans with foreign spouses who are holders of Long Term Visit Pass Plus (LTVP+), they are also eligible for healthcare subsidies for inpatient services. Long Term Visit Pass (LTVP) holders do not enjoy subsidies.It is not meaningful to compute the incremental cost of extending healthcare subsidies to all LTVP holders, as it will involve assumptions on the number of LTVP holders, their healthcare needs, and the extent of the subsidy to be granted when there is currently no plan to do so."
usage of medisave funds,"Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked the Minister for Health how many people have applied, and been successfully approved, in the use of their Medisave funds under the Flexi Medisave scheme since its implementation.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Flexi-Medisave scheme was introduced in April 2015 to allow older Singaporeans to use up to $200 of Medisave each year to pay for their outpatient medical treatments at public sector Specialist Outpatient Clinics, Polyclinics, and General Practitioner clinics under the Community Health Assist Scheme. All Singaporeans aged 65 and older are eligible for this scheme, they do not need to submit applications for approval.In 2016, more than 260,000 Singaporeans, or about one in two Singaporeans aged 65 or older, have benefitted from the Flexi-Medisave scheme."
plans to redevelop katong swimming complex,"Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth whether there are any plans to re-develop Katong Swimming Complex.","Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: The full redevelopment of the Katong Swimming Complex will be considered under later phases of Sport Singapore’s (SportSG’s) Sports Facilities Master Plan. However, SportSG plans to carry out rejuvenation works to enhance the user experience at the swimming complex within the next few years."
employers' attitudes towards hiring of older workers,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether any study has been done to look into local employers' attitudes towards hiring older workers especially in the IT sector; (b) how many complaints has the Ministry received in the past three years on employment practices against older workers; and (c) what is being done to actively engage employers to encourage them to accept qualified older hires.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: From a 2016 survey conducted by the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP), about seven in 10 employers were willing to redesign job scopes to accommodate older workers. This is also evident from the employment rate of older residents aged 55-64 which has steadily increased over the last five years, from 64.0% in 2012 to 67.3% in 2016. We are already among the top in terms of employment rate of older workers aged 55-64, compared to other OECD countries. Specifically for the ICT sector, which Er Dr Lee asked about, the share of older workers remained stable over the same period.In the last three years, TAFEP and the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has, on average, received less than 80 age discrimination complaints against employers per year. This constituted about 10% of the total complaints received by TAFEP and MOM each year. Age discrimination complaints involving workers from the IT sector form around 7% of all age discrimination complaints. For cases with clear evidence of age discrimination, MOM had further investigated and taken action against the errant employers, including curtailment of their work pass privileges.TAFEP had also engaged these employers to help them rectify their employment practices.Older workers are assets to the workforce. To change mindsets, TAFEP runs campaigns to raise awareness of the value that older workers bring to the workforce.However, some employers may still be concerned about the suitability of older jobseekers. To help overcome this, the Career Support Programme under the Adapt and Grow initiative provides greater wage support to employers who hire mature PMETs. We have also increased salary support for mature PMETs who participate in Professional Conversion Programmes, so as to encourage employers to tap on the pool of experienced and skilled PMETs.Older workers must also play their part to continually upskill, reskill and deep-skill to enhance their employability. Skills upgrading is the best safeguard for older workers during this period of economic and job transformation. We encourage older workers to take advantage of the various Government training schemes such as SkillsFuture and Adapt & Grow."
inspections conducted on accommodation for foreign workers,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Manpower (a) in the past three years, how many housing inspections have been conducted and how many employers have been found to have provided unacceptable accommodation for foreign workers; and (b) whether follow-up actions have been undertaken for all errant employers to ensure compliance with the regulations for acceptable accommodation.","Mr Lim Swee Say: From 2014 to 2016, MOM conducted close to 4,000 foreign workers (FW) housing inspections. Over this period, MOM ramped up our housing inspections from 700 in 2014 to 1,800 in 2016, to proactively inspect all larger dormitories and other smaller housing types suspected to be in poor conditions as well as respond to complaints.The foreign worker housing landscape has improved in recent years, with the stepping up of enforcement and raising of regulatory standards. We have seen a decline in the number of public complaints related to foreign workers housing, from close to 600 in 2014 to 500 in 2016.Most of the cases found with poor living conditions were private residential units, typically with multiple employers housing workers in a single unit. The larger FW housing, such as Purpose Built Dormitories and Factory Converted Dormitories, are in better condition.Where infringements were found, MOM has ensured that employers or dormitory operators take immediate rectification action, such as making improvements to the housing condition for minor breaches, or relocating the workers to other approved accommodation altogether for severe breaches. In total, about 4,000 employers and/or dormitory operators were issued with warnings, composition fines, or prosecuted, arising from these inspections."
participation of private healthcare institutions in national electronic health record (nehr) system,"Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Health if he will provide an update on the participation in the National Electronic Health Record (NEHR) system by private healthcare institutions including hospitals, general practitioners and institutions run by voluntary welfare organisations.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Since the National Electronic Health Record (NEHR) was introduced in 2013, usage has been on the increase. Today, more than 21,000 healthcare professionals, including doctors, nurses and pharmacists, from more than 1,000 healthcare providers have access to the NEHR. In a typical month, more than 767,000 patient record searches are being made.The providers using NEHR come from different settings. For example, 56% of GP clinics and 70% of the Intermediate and Long Term Care providers have access to NEHR. In the past year, more care providers from the private sector, including specialist clinics, dental clinics, and x-ray labs, have come on board.We will continue to encourage healthcare providers and professionals to adopt NEHR so as to bring more benefits to patients."
new jobs created for university degree holders,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Manpower what is the proportion of new jobs created in each of the last five years which requires a university degree.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: The Ministry of Manpower does not collect data on new jobs created by specific qualification requirements, including university degrees. This is because such data may not meaningfully reflect the quality of a job or the responsibilities associated with it.In line with the Committee on the Future Economy (CFE)’s recommendations, the Ministry encourages companies to adopt progressive HR practices and focus on skills and competencies as the key yardstick in the recruitment and development of workers, beyond academic grades or qualifications."
waiver of non-transferability of coe for categories a and b vehicles,Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for Transport under what circumstances has LTA waived the policy of non-transferability and permitted a transfer of COEs for Category A or B vehicles from one individual to another.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The Land Transport Authority (LTA) allows the Temporary COE for Category A and B vehicles to be transferred only if there are very serious and unforeseen changes in the COE holder’s circumstances which are beyond his or her control, such as when the COE holder has passed away. The Temporary COE can only be transferred to immediate family members."
police-to-population ratio including and excluding auxiliary police officers,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for Home Affairs what is the current police-to-population ratio in terms of including and excluding auxiliary police officers respectively.,"Mr K Shanmugam: There are about 170 regular Police Officers in the Singapore Police Force per 100,000 population.Including the Auxiliary Police Officers (APOs), there are about 300 regular Police Officers and APOs per 100,000 population."
driving lessons to navigate traffic roundabouts,Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for Home Affairs how many traffic roundabouts are there in Singapore and whether students taking their driving lessons are taught how to navigate traffic roundabouts.,Mr K Shanmugam: There are 46 traffic roundabouts on our public roads. The curriculum for learner drivers as well as the driving theory tests cover the navigation of roundabouts.
sectoral statistics on waste management and recycling from 2014 to 2016,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) in the last three years, what percentage of companies in our industrial and commercial sectors are actively engaged in waste management and recycling; (b) what percentage of households are engaged in recycling; and (c) what measures are in place to improve the recycling rates for companies and households.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The recycling performance of the domestic and non-domestic sectors are key indicators which are tracked by my Ministry. In 2016, the non-domestic sector (comprising industrial and commercial premises) recycled 76% of its waste while the domestic sector (comprising households and trade premises) recycled 21% of its waste.We have set ambitious recycling targets to be achieved by 2030. In addition to an overall recycling rate of 70%, we aim to reach a non-domestic recycling rate of 81% and a domestic recycling rate of 30%.The non-domestic sector has shown consistently higher recycling rates. The National Environment Agency (NEA) works closely with companies to implement waste reduction and recycling programmes. For example, under the mandatory waste reporting initiative, large hotels with more than 200 rooms and shopping malls with net lettable areas of more than 50,000 square feet are required to submit annual waste data and waste reduction plans. Based on the reports received, NEA engages the building managers of these premises on how to better manage their waste streams.NEA also works with stakeholders to develop and update 3R guidebooks for different industry sectors. These step-by-step guidebooks are accessible on the NEA website. Regular engagement is also done with the industry to promote adoption of 3R practices.Our domestic recycling rate has remained at around 20% in the last few years. Our approach to improve the recycling rate for households is to make recycling more convenient and to raise awareness on recycling. Currently, every HDB block and private landed property is provided with a recycling bin while condominiums are mandated to provide recycling receptacles. To further enhance the recycling infrastructure, all new HDB Build-to-Order flats launched since 2014 are installed with dual chutes for refuse and recyclables. As announced earlier, the provision of recycling chutes will be extended to private residential developments. Buildings taller than four storeys in all new non-landed private residential developments will be required to install dual chutes for refuse and recyclables from 1 April 2018. This will make recycling as convenient as refuse disposal for households.However, infrastructure provision alone is not enough, and we need everyone to make recycling a habit. To raise awareness on recycling, NEA provides information on proper recycling habits on its website and the myENV mobile app. A ‘3R’ video for households is also available on YouTube. NEA also works with schools and other community partners on public education programmes to promote recycling habits in households."
building a wet market and hawker centre at upper serangoon crescent,Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether the Government will build a wet market and hawker centre at Upper Serangoon Crescent or its vicinity in view of the new housing developments in the area.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The National Environment Agency (NEA) takes into account several factors in the siting of new hawker centres and markets, such as the location of existing facilities, the availability of suitable land for new sites, and the population of the town.There are currently eating establishments and commercial facilities in the vicinity of Upper Serangoon Crescent. In particular, there are wet markets in Rivervale Plaza and market produce shops in Hougang Central. There are also two hawker centres with wet markets located at Block 209 Hougang Street 21 (Kovan Market and Food Centre) and Block 105 Hougang Avenue 1, as well as a hawker centre located at 51 Hougang Avenue 9 (Ci Yuan Hawker Centre) which was opened in 2015. There are no plans to build a hawker centre nor wet market in Upper Serangoon Crescent. Notwithstanding this, we review the need for new hawker centres to serve new housing developments regularly."
estimate of five-year-old private non-landed properties not subject to seller's stamp duty,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the projected number of five-year old private non-landed properties in 2017 and in the next three years whereby sellers will not be subjected to the seller's stamp duty; and (b) how many of these properties are in the Core Central Region and outside of the Core Central Region respectively.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: From 2017 to 2020, the estimated total number of private non-landed properties that were purchased five years ago, whereby sellers will not be subject to Seller’s Stamp Duty, is about 12,000 in the Core Central Region and 67,000 outside of the Core Central Region.Property transaction data can be obtained via URA’s Real Estate Information System (REALIS) at https//spring.ura.gov.sg/lad/ore/login/index.cfm."
applications from single unwed mothers aged 35 years and below to purchase or rent a hdb flat,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for National Development for each of the years in the past three years (a) how many single unwed mothers under the age of 35 have applied together with their children and without other family members to purchase or rent a flat from HDB; and (b) how many of such applications have been approved.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: From 2014 to 2016, about 100 single unwed parents under the age of 35 appealed to buy a flat with their children and without other family members. Over the same period, about 300 single unwed parents under the age of 35 appealed to rent a flat from HDB with their children. For both types of appeals, HDB approved about one-fifth of the cases. The remainder could continue living with their parents, could afford other housing options or were already co-owners of a flat."
criteria for classification of hdb estates as mature or non-mature,Mr Darryl David asked the Minister for National Development what criteria does HDB use when classifying estates as 'mature' or 'non-mature' and whether this criteria is made known to the public.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Non-mature towns/estates refer to those where there is more land available for public housing development, whereas mature towns/estates are usually those with limited land for public housing development.To guide applicants in Build-To-Order (BTO) and Sale of Balance Flats (SBF) exercises, the estate classifications of the flats on offer are stated in the HDB’s press releases and e-sales brochures."
hdb flats reaching minimum occupation period of five years from 2017 to 2020,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development how many HDB flats will reach their Minimum Occupation Period of five years in 2017 and in the next three years.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB flat owners are required to fulfil a Minimum Occupation Period (MOP) before they are eligible to sell their flats on the open market.For flats bought directly from the HDB, about 12,000 of them will fulfil their five-year MOP in 2017 and another 56,000 flats will fulfil their MOP from 2018 to 2020. For flats bought from the resale market, about 22,000 will fulfil their MOP this year and another 56,000 flats will fulfil their MOP from 2018 to 2020."
statistics on students diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder from 2012 to 2016,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Education (Schools) how many students in Singapore have been diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder in each year over the past five years.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: Based on data reported by both mainstream and Special Education schools, the number of students diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder enrolled in these schools range from about 3500 in 2012 to about 5000 in 2016."
hdb lifts able to accommodate standard-size ambulance stretchers in emergencies,Mr Ong Teng Koon asked the Minister for National Development whether there are plans to ensure that all HDB lifts are able to accommodate standard-size ambulance stretchers in the event of emergencies.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Most of the lifts in HDB residential blocks meet the minimum internal lift car dimension requirement as stipulated by Building and Construction Authority's (BCA) Building Control Regulations. However, some of the lifts in older HDB residential blocks may have smaller lifts that do not meet this minimum requirement. These lifts can accommodate a wheelchair, but not an ambulance stretcher in an inclined position. HDB will work with the respective Town Councils to see what can be done for these lifts."
children who start primary school education without attending pre-school,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Education (Schools) for each year from 2011 to 2016, how many children have started their primary school education without having previously attended kindergarten.","Mr Ng Chee Meng: From 2011 to 2016, 99% of each primary one cohort have attended at least one year of pre-school."
annual breakdown of new jobs created from 2011 to 2016,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the breakdown of new jobs created each year from 2011 to 2016 amongst MNCs, SMEs, GLCs and the public service; and (b) what is the breakdown of net new jobs created each year from 2011 to 2016 amongst MNCs, SMEs, GLCs and the public service.","Mr Lim Swee Say: The net employment change of workers in SMEs1, non-SMEs2 and the Public Service3 from 2011 to 2016 is provided in Table 1. Data on gross job creation is not available."
use of video-conferencing facilities for enforcement of maintenance orders applications,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) in the past three years, how many applications for the enforcement of maintenance orders have been made using video-conferencing facilities at the Singapore Council of Women's Organisations and the Tampines Family Service Centre; and (b) how does this compare to the overall number of applications.","Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: From 2014 to 2016, 23 to 26 applications for the enforcement of maintenance orders were filed annually through video-conferencing at the Singapore Council of Women’s Organisations’ Maintenance Support Central (SCWO-MSC), Tampines Family Service Centre (FSC), and at HELP FSC4, one of the Divorce Support Specialist Agencies (see Table 1).The cases comprised around 1% of the total number of enforcement applications annually from 2014 to 2016, which was around 2,600 to 3,000.The Ministry has been working closely with the Family Justice Courts (FJC) to simplify and increase accessibility of the enforcement process. Apart from video-conferencing and assistance with applications, SCWO-MSC and HELP FSC provide a more comprehensive suite of services to parties seeking enforcement of maintenance, including credit bureau reporting and counselling. The Ministry will continue to work with the FJC and the service centres to raise awareness of the services provided at the centres."
"breakdown of online drug peddling offenders by gender, ethnicity and family income from 2014","Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) if he will provide a breakdown of those arrested for online drug peddling by gender, ethnicity and family income since 2014; and (b) whether the Ministry has identified the factors that have led to a spike in the number of online drug peddling cases between 2014 and 2015.","Mr K Shanmugam: Law enforcement agencies worldwide face the growing challenge of online drugs sale. The anonymity provided by the Internet makes it more difficult to detect and apprehend the offenders. We also face this challenge in Singapore.In 2016, the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) arrested 201 persons for buying drugs and drug-related paraphernalia online. This was a significant increase from the 30 persons arrested in 2015 and the 6 arrested in 2014.For the profile of the offenders, it is more meaningful to look at the 2016 data because the numbers in 2014 and 2015 were small. The majority of those arrested in 2016 for online drug trading were male and between the ages of 20 to 39 years old. Chinese and Malays made up about 50% and 30% respectively of the persons arrested. We do not have data on their individual or family income.The increase in the online drug trade is a direct result of the increasing use of the Internet. More people have taken to the Internet for shopping and other transactions. It not surprising that drug buyers and suppliers are also moving online.Moreover the Internet offers the cloak of anonymity and therefore a perceived sense of safety. The Internet allows buyers to purchase their drugs without physically meeting with the suppliers. The buyers and suppliers may think that in this way they can better evade detection by law enforcement agencies.CNB works closely with partners such as the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) and courier companies to detect and take action against the online drug trade. As part of CNB’s public education efforts, the agency works with the media to publish trends and dangers of people ordering drugs and drug paraphernalia online. CNB also conducts outreach online to engage persons who may be vulnerable to the online drug trade. CNB will continue to monitor the developments closely and keep up its enforcement and public education efforts."
composition of sg enable management team,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) how many persons with disabilities and/or special needs are there on the SG Enable Management Team; and (b) what percentage of the management team do they comprise.,"Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: SG Enable was established in 2013 as an agency to support persons with disability for employment and training, access to schemes as well as provision of information and referral to disability services. SGE is governed by a Board of Directors who provide strategic guidance on the delivery of programmes and services for persons with disabilities as well as ensure proper management of resources of the organisation. Currently, two of the 13 Board members are persons with disabilities. Many of the Board members are also involved in programmes and services that support persons with disabilities. These members provide insights on the needs of persons with disabilities and how SG Enable can play a part in supporting the group.Apart from its Board Members, 6% of SG Enable’s workforce comprise persons with disabilities and this is above the national average of 0.55% amongst the resident labour force. In addition to being an inclusive employer, SG Enable believes that this group of staff have enabled the organisation to better understand the clients they serve, and to be pro-active in meeting their needs."
number of qualified arborists in singapore,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for National Development (a) currently, how many qualified arborists are there in Singapore; (b) of this number, how many are under the employment of NParks; and (c) whether the Ministry regards this number to be sufficient.",Mr Lawrence Wong: There are 500 qualified arborists in Singapore today. Two hundred are employed by the National Parks Board (NParks) to oversee its tree management programme. The pool of 200 NParks arborists is adequate for now. The Ministry of National Development (MND) and NParks are continually reviewing our resources to ensure that there are sufficient arborists to handle the work requirements.
recidivism rates of drug rehabilitation and long term imprisonment cohorts released from 2012 to 2014,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Home Affairs for each year from 2012 to 2014 what are the recidivism rates for the release cohorts from (i) the Drug Rehabilitation Centres (ii) the Long Term Imprisonment 1 regime and (iii) Long Term Imprisonment 2 regime, respectively.","Mr K Shanmugam: The two-year recidivism rates for persons released from the Drug Rehabilitation Centre (DRC), Long-Term Imprisonment 1 (LT1) and Long-Term Imprisonment 2 (LT2) from 2012 to 2014 are as follows.The recidivism rates in recent years for drug inmates have fallen significantly from the 60 – 70% in the 1990s.In the past few years, several new programmes were introduced to better support the rehabilitation of DRC and LT inmates.Singapore Prison Service (SPS) introduced the Enhanced Supervision Scheme (ESS) in 2012 to provide more intensive support for high-risk Long-Term Imprisonment inmates. They undergo a psychology-based programme during incarceration as well as mandatory casework, individual counselling and community supervision after their release. The Prisons Act was also amended in 2014 to introduce the Mandatory Aftercare Scheme (MAS), which provides structured supervision to high-risk offenders as they transition back into the community. In 2014, SPS launched the enhanced Drug Rehabilitation Regime which placed DRC inmates on tailored programmes based on their re-offending risks and severity of drug use."
groups most vulnerable to online drug peddling and recidivism rate of drug abusers aged 20 to 29,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) which are the groups most vulnerable to online peddling of drugs; (b) what is the rate of recidivism for drug abusers between the ages of 20 to 29 over the last three years; and (c) how is the Ministry working to reduce drug abuse in the age group of 20 to 29.,"Mr K Shanmugam: Law enforcement agencies worldwide face the emerging challenge of tackling online drugs sale. Traffickers and drug abusers can trade drugs anonymously on online black market websites. This makes it difficult for law enforcement agencies to detect and apprehend the offenders.We also face this challenge in Singapore. The Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) works closely with partners, such as the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) and courier companies, to detect and take action against online drug trade. In 2016, CNB arrested around 200 persons for buying drugs and drug-related paraphernalia online. The majority of these persons were between the ages of 20 to 39 years old. These individuals are vulnerable to the online sale of drugs as they are tech-savvy and are familiar with online transactions.While the total number of drug abusers arrested fell in 2016, there was an increase in the number of new drug abusers arrested. Close to two-thirds of all new abusers arrested were under the age of 30. This is an area of concern. The two-year recidivism rate for drug abusers between the ages of 20 to 29 has been around 34-36% in the last three years:Preventive drug education (PDE) is our first line of defence in the fight against drug abuse. This is especially true for younger persons, including those between 20 to 29 years old. CNB reaches out to them through multiple channels.CNB partners key influencers in the community to spread the anti-drug message. For example, National Service (NS) Commanders have regular interaction with their NSmen and are well placed to detect signs of drug-related problems. CNB launched the NS Commander Toolkit in June 2016 to equip them with information on drug abuse as well as how to identify and steer potential abusers away from drugs.CNB is also building a community of advocates who will spread the anti-drug message among their peers. Some of our initiatives to advance advocacy for a drug-free Singapore include the forming of the United Against Drugs Coalition and the Anti-Drug Abuse Advocacy (A3) Network. Through these programmes, we aim to mobilise the community to support our zero tolerance approach to drugs.CNB is also enhancing its online presence. CNB uses social media to reach out to this group of abusers to share information about the dangers of drugs, including how drug abuse can harm the abuser’s family and loved ones.In addition to CNB's engagement and PDE efforts, we need rigorous enforcement to keep drugs away from our young. CNB maintains a tough stance against drugs and will not let up on its efforts to arrest drug traffickers who sell to our young.CNB will continue to address the trends of youth drug abuse and online drug peddling through a comprehensive approach of enforcement, education and engagement."
plans to deepen singaporeans' ict capabilities,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) what is the Government's plan to deepen our younger Singaporeans' ICT capabilities so that they are equipped to seize opportunities of tomorrow; and (b) how can the Ministry ensure that ICT and digital training classes such as coding classes are accessible to less privileged Singaporeans.,"Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim: Digital technologies are transforming the way we live, work and play. Increasing digitalisation poses fresh challenges to traditional industries and business models, but also offer exciting opportunities for the bold and enterprising. As the Committee on the Future Economy noted, Singapore must harness the opportunities in the digital economy, by transforming our businesses and people to be digital ready.MCI has many programmes to help our people do this. For ICT professionals, we launched the TechSkills Accelerator (TeSA) last year to train and upskill professionals into ICT job roles. We have made good progress, with over 8,000 professionals trained as at end-2016. In fact, the Company-Led Training programme, which encourages ICT companies to provide On-the-Job (OJT) training to individuals beyond what they intend to hire, has seen 100% of trainees successfully placed into jobs after their training period. In addition, for non-ICT professionals who have aspirations to pursue an ICT career, they can consider our Tech Immersion and Placement Programme, which uses short immersive courses to train professionals with essential ICT skills so as to facilitate their placement into ICT jobs. We will continue to step up efforts to train more professionals, and ensure that Singaporeans, including young professionals, are able to seize opportunities in the digital economy.In a world where digitalisation is more pervasive, we recognise the value in going beyond training ICT professionals, to imbuing every Singaporean with a good understanding of ICT so that we all thrive in the digital economy. To interest and prepare school-going Singaporeans in ICT skills, IMDA and GovTech have programmes, such as Code@SG and Hour of Code, to inspire students and develop their coding and computational thinking skills. Starting this year, IMDA will be extending Code@SG's Code for Fun enrichment programme to all primary and secondary school students. In addition, IMDA also runs the Industry Preparation for Pre-Graduates (iPREP) programme, to equip students with relevant skillsets for a career in ICT, through work attachments, courses and overseas internships.MCI fully agrees that we must bring every Singaporean, especially the less privileged, along with us on our digital journey. The above programmes are accessible to all Singaporeans regardless of age and socio-economic status. In addition, IMDA today also runs digital inclusion programmes, such as the NEU PC Plus and Home Access Programme, to give low-income households, the elderly and persons with special needs access to computers and broadband connectivity."
update on ratification of eu-singapore free trade agreement eusfta,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Trade) in light of the opinion issued by the Advocate General of the Court of Justice of the EU that the EU does not have exclusive competence to conclude the EU-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (EUSFTA), whether he can provide an update on how the relevant parties are working towards a swift ratification of the EUSFTA.","Mr Lim Hng Kiang: On 4 March 2015, the European Commission (Commission) sent the negotiated text of the EU-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (EUSFTA) to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) for a legal opinion to establish the Commission’s and EU Member States' (MS) areas of competence in the EUSFTA. The opinion would clarify which of the EUSFTA provisions fall within (i) the EU’s exclusive competence; or are (ii) shared competence between the EU and MS; or are (iii) within the MS’ exclusive competence.Should the entire EUSFTA agreement be found to be under the EU's exclusive competence, it would only have to be approved by the Council of the EU (Council) and the European Parliament (EP). The agreement would enter into force thereafter on a mutually agreed date.The Advocate General's preliminary opinion released on 21 December 2016 opined that the EUSFTA should be deemed a ""mixed agreement"" with areas of shared competence between the EU and MS. If the ECJ takes the same view, it would mean that the agreement has to be approved by the Council, the EP as well as the 38 national and regional Parliaments of all MS. However, the provisions in the agreement deemed to be under the EU's exclusive competence would be provisionally applied and take effect once the Council and the EP have approved. In comparison, provisions that are under shared competence or MS' exclusive competence would have to go through domestic ratification processes in all MS before they can take effect.The ECJ's final opinion, which is deliberated by a full court of 28 Judges, is typically released three to five months after the Advocate General's preliminary opinion.Singapore is actively working with the EU and MS to ensure that the EUSFTA can proceed with ratification as soon as the ECJ delivers its final opinion so that businesses can reap its benefits as soon as possible."
lasting power of attorneys (lpas),"Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan asked the Minister for Social and Family Development to date, how many Lasting Power of Attorneys (LPAs) or similar instruments have been revoked due to fraud or undue pressure being used to induce the donor to enter into them and due to the donee behaving in a way that contravenes his authority or in a manner not in the donor's best interests.","6 Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan asked the Minister for Social and Family Development since the last amendments to the Mental Capacity Act came into effect in 2016 (a) how many orders of suspension have been made where there is a risk of dissipation of the donor's property; and (b) how many errant donees, deputies or prescribed certificate issuers have been dealt with by the courts or the Office of the Public Guardian.7 Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what are the safeguards to ensure that a certificate issuer verifies that the donor understands the purpose of the Lasting Power of Attorney or a similar instrument and the scope of the authority conferred under it; (b) whether the Ministry will add further safeguards against abuse by donees or deputies; and (c) whether pro bono legal advice will be afforded to donors in the absence of a professional donee or deputy.Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: Since its inception, the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) has processed around 1,000 Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) revocations as at end January 2017. This represents approximately 4% of the LPAs accepted as at end January 2017. The overwhelming majority (98%) of all revocations are due to death of the donor or done, or because the donor decided to make a new LPA.Section 17(3) of the Mental Capacity Act (MCA) allows for the Court to make a determination on an LPA if the Court is satisfied that fraud or undue pressure was used to induce the donor into making an LPA. To date, the Court has not revoked any LPAs under this clause.To better protect those without capacity, the Ministry introduced a new section (S36A) of the MCA in March 2016. Now the Public Guardian can go to Court and apply for a suspension order to preserve the donor's assets where there is clear evidence that a donee or deputy has acted in a way which compromises the interests of the donor and there is no one else to protect him.Once the Court makes the suspension order, OPG will annotate on the original LPA that the LPA is suspended. This information is uploaded on its website so that third parties can check and not proceed with any transactions. The appointed donees and deputies would no longer be able to make decisions and act on behalf of the donor for the time period as stipulated in the Court order.Since the amendments came into effect, the Public Guardian has acted in two cases. She has applied to Court in one case to suspend a donee’s powers and revoke the LPA. She has also filed an application to revoke the powers of a deputy. As both cases are still pending in Court, we are unable to provide more details of the cases.An LPA certificate issuer is required to sign on the LPA certificate to state that he had seen the donor and is of the opinion that the donor understands the purpose of the LPA and the scope of the authority conferred under it. He has to satisfy himself that no fraud or undue pressure was used to induce the donor to make the LPA and there is nothing else that would prevent the LPA from being created.Due to the crucial safeguarding role played by an LPA certificate issuer, the OPG has engaged the Law Society, the Singapore Medical Association and the Singapore Psychiatric Association so that their members understand the roles and responsibilities of a certificate issuer. For doctors who are not specialists in psychiatry, they are also required to undergo an online course administered by the Singapore Medical Association before they can be accredited by the Public Guardian.OPG takes a serious view of breaches made by certificate issuers and will not hesitate to bring them to Court or report them to their professional bodies if they breach their professional duties. To date, OPG has reported one case of professional misconduct of two lawyers to the Law Society, for their investigation. The original LPA application signed by a first lawyer was rejected because of her relationship to the donee. She then asked a second lawyer to sign off on the LPA as the certificate issuer, which he did without meeting the donor. After the OPG report, the Law Society started disciplinary proceedings against the lawyers involved in this one case. The matter was determined to be serious enough to be referred to the Court of 3 Judges. The Court found that both lawyers had acted improperly and suspended the first lawyer from practice for 2.5 years. The second lawyer was suspended for one year. These lawyers can no longer practice law during the periods of suspension.The MCA has also a ""whistle-blower"" clause to protect the identity of a whistle-blower in a report of ill-treatment of a person who lacks mental capacity. Thus, anyone who knows, suspects or believes that a person who lacks capacity is not properly looked after and/or needs care or protection can report this to the OPG. The same whistle blowing measure applies for deputies who have been appointed by the Court. In addition, deputies have to submit an annual report containing information on major decisions made by the deputy in the past year, for the Public Guardian's review. If there are areas of concern highlighted through a report, the Public Guardian will take the appropriate action to safeguard the person’s well-being.These few cases form a very small proportion of the thousands of LPAs made, accounting for only about 0.003% of all LPAs submitted. The vast majority of all certificate issuers act diligently and honestly in carrying out their professional duties. We also need to balance against having excessive safeguards measures which makes the LPA less accessible to many Singaporeans. This is why we encourage donors to choose their donee wisely, and to inform their families and loved ones of their decision.My Ministry also understands that there are costs involved in the making of an LPA. In order to encourage more Singaporeans to make an LPA, the application fee waiver for Singaporeans putting in place a basic LPA has been extended till 31 August 2018. While there is still a professional fee involved to engage a certificate issuer to act as a witness to the donor's statement in the LPA and issue the required LPA Certificate, there is also a social service agency, Lifepoint, which offers help to senior citizens. They organise LPA sessions and work with lawyers to help the elderly get their Forms certified at a lower cost. The OPG website also identifies a list of accredited medical practitioners who are the most active and may offer applicants a more competitive rate for most of the cases they see.Families in financial difficulty can also seek legal assistance from the Legal Aid Bureau under the Ministry of Law to file the deputyship application. Applicants will have to go through a Means Test and Merits Test to qualify for legal aid.When choosing to make an LPA, it is important that the donor appoints someone he trusts, and whom he knows can make the best decisions on his behalf in future if he should become vulnerable one day."
increase in number of eligible electorates since last general election,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Prime Minister (a) to date, what is the total increase in the number of eligible electorates since last general election; (b) which is the electoral division that has the highest number of increase; and (c) what is the projected increase in the number of eligible electorates in three years' time.",Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): The latest certified registers of electors contain the names of all Singapore citizens qualified as electors as at 1 February 2015. The increase in the number of electors since the last General Election in 2015 and the electoral division with the highest increase will only be known when the registers of electors are next revised.The Elections Department does not make projections on the number of qualified electors and works on the basis of the actual number of electors when the registers of electors are revised.
studies on impact of pro-family measures on raising fertility rates,"Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Prime Minister (a) what studies or research have been conducted to understand the impact of various pro-family measures such as baby bonus and faster access to HDB flats, on raising fertility rates; and (b) how will the findings guide implementation of future Government interventions.","Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): The Government regularly reviews the Marriage & Parenthood (M&P) Package to see how we can better provide a supportive and family-friendly environment in Singapore. We conduct surveys and studies to better understand the impact and take-up of our measures. For example, we carry out the M&P Survey every three to five years to better understand Singaporeans’ attitudes towards marriage and parenthood, including their views on relevant support measures. We also draw on studies by academics and other groups, such as the survey by The Straits Times and Employer Alliance on Work-Life Integration in 2014. Relevant studies of M&P trends in other countries are similarly referenced for insights.In addition, we hold consultations with diverse groups of Singaporeans, including married couples with and without children, singles, students in tertiary education institutes, caregivers of young children, and people sector representatives. Through these consultations, we have received positive feedback that measures such as the Baby Bonus Scheme have helped parents defray child-raising costs, while others such as housing measures have facilitated young couples’ plans to settle down and build their families.The learning points from these studies and consultations have been important in helping us to refine the M&P Package, which has been enhanced progressively and significantly since it was first introduced in 2001. For instance, last year, we announced further enhancements to Paternity Leave and Shared Parental Leave to better support shared parental responsibility between mothers and fathers.Even as we continue to refine policy measures, we are cognisant that birth rates do not depend only on government initiatives. Social norms shape M&P decisions and these are in turn a result of multiple factors. Fortunately, aspirations for marriage and parenthood among Singaporeans remain strong. To get ready for Millennial families, we will need the support of the whole of society - employers, co-workers, community organisations, businesses and Government - to promote a more family-friendly environment where marriage and parenthood are achievable, enjoyable and celebrated."
contamination rate of recyclables from household recycling,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether the Ministry can clarify what is (i) the contamination rate of recyclables from household recycling and (ii) the most common form of or reason for this contamination.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Under the National Recycling Programme (NRP), Public Waste Collectors (PWCs) are required to provide a blue co-mingled recycling bin at every HDB block and for all landed residential premises. Recycling receptacles must also be provided in condominium developments. This co-mingled recycling bin system under the NRP makes it convenient for residents as they do not have to spend additional time and effort to segregate the different types of recyclables (that is, paper, metal, plastic and glass) nor set aside space in their homes to store different types of recyclables separately.While much effort has been put into encouraging domestic recycling, our domestic recycling rate was only 19% in 2015. We need to work harder to achieve our target of a domestic recycling rate of 30% by 2030. This includes inculcating responsible recycling habits, such as preventing the contamination of recyclables in the co-mingled recycling bins by placing only items which can be recycled in such bins.According to the PWCs, about 40% of items found in the recycling bins have to be disposed of as they cannot be recycled. Some of the common non-recyclable items found deposited in recycling bins include soft toys and old shoes. Food waste found mixed with recyclables is another problem. Recyclables contaminated with food waste cannot be recycled and also create pest and odour problems.All co-mingled recycling bins in the NRP have clear labels that indicate what items can be recycled, such as clean paper, plastics, metal cans, glass and old clothing. Through public education programmes in schools and at grassroots events, my Ministry and the National Environment Agency strongly encourage everyone to contribute to our recycling efforts and to ensure that only items which are suitable for recycling are deposited in the co-mingled recycling bins."
updates on new and innovative technologies for hdb residents with lift access problems,"Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether there are updates on new and innovative technologies that can offer HDB residents, whose units are located in infrastructurally challenging positions, the lift access to their dwelling units; and (b) what is the proportion of such units within our HDB catchment.","Mr Lawrence Wong: The Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP) was launched in 2001 to provide direct lift access to flats and enhance convenience for residents, especially the elderly and less mobile. At the start of the programme, there were more than 5,300 HDB blocks without 100% lift access. Among them, more than 1,000 blocks were initially found to be unfeasible for LUP due to cost or technical constraints.Over the years, HDB has adopted innovative technical solutions and conducted some lift pilot trials to help such blocks with lift access. Some examples of these solutions that have been successfully implemented include lifts that do not have a machine room at the top of the shafts (that is, machine room-less elevators) and bubble lifts. In some blocks, HDB has also successfully reconfigured lift access with new entry points to residents’ homes. More recently, HDB piloted the Pneumatic Vacuum Elevator and the Vertical Platform Lift in an effort to offer LUP to more blocks. However, both solutions have been assessed to be unfeasible for heavy residential use, and will not be implemented in HDB estates.Through the various innovations solutions, the vast majority of the 5,300 blocks are now able to benefit from LUP. There remains only about 150 blocks where HDB has not found any solutions to overcome the existing constraints. On a flat basis, less than 1% of our sold flats do not have direct lift access. Singaporeans who are in urgent need of direct lift access due to medical conditions or disability may approach HDB for housing and financing assistance. HDB assesses each request on a case-by-case basis to see how best to render help."
forensic medical examination for victims of sex crimes,"Mr Chen Show Mao asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether victims of sex crimes are required to make a police report before they can get a forensic medical examination done and, if so, why; and (b) whether this examination is only available at three hospitals in Singapore and, if so, why is this not more widely available.","Mr K Shanmugam: Sexual crimes are serious and reportable crimes. The Police encourage all victims to come forward to report these offences, so that the perpetrators can be brought to justice.Forensic medical examination is an important part of the criminal investigation into sexual crimes. The Police issue Sexual Assault Examination Kits to Singapore General Hospital (SGH), KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH) and National University Hospital (NUH), because these are the only hospitals with 24/7 Obstetrics and Gynaecology (O&G) Specialist Clinics that can facilitate forensic medical examination at any time of the day.Trained O&G specialists use these kits to gather and preserve physical evidence in cases of serious sexual assault, including semen, blood, body fluids, and hair, in order to assist the criminal investigation and any subsequent prosecution. It is thus important that a Police report is lodged first, to enable the Police to commence investigations swiftly. The forensic medical examination is not a medical treatment process. A Police report is not needed for the victim to seek immediate medical attention.The Minister for Home Affairs recently announced a new initiative to make forensic medical examinations more convenient for rape victims. The Police have partnered SGH’s O&G department to operationalise the new One-Stop Abuse Forensic Examination Centre, or OneSAFE Centre, at Police Cantonment Complex. Since 15 January 2017, adult rape victims whose cases are reported within 72 hours of the assault, and who do not require any other medical attention can go through the necessary forensic medical examination at the OneSAFE Centre, without needing to travel to one of the three hospitals."
community dispute applications received by community disputes resolution tribunals,"Ms Tin Pei Ling asked the Minister for Law (a) over the past 12 months, how many community dispute applications have been received by the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals; (b) of these, how many have been (i) accepted by the tribunals (ii) successfully resolved and (iii) given orders for one of the parties to receive a mental health assessment.","Mr K Shanmugam: The Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals (CDRT) was established on 1 October 2015 as a forum to help neighbours with difficult disputes resolve their conflicts after avenues such as community mediation have been exhausted.Between 1 October 2015 and 31 January 2017, the CDRT received 109 applications. Out of these 109 applications, 102 claims have been disposed of and seven claims are pending. Out of the 102 claims that have been disposed of, a total of 73 claims were successfully resolved - 55 claims were withdrawn/discontinued and a Consent Order was granted in the other 18 claims. As for the remaining 29 claims, the CDRT granted orders after trial or dismissed/struck off the applications.The Community Disputes Resolution Act 2015 does not provide the CDRT with the power to order a party to undergo a mental health assessment. However, there are existing measures in place to facilitate the referral of parties who may be suffering from mental health issues for examination. The CDRT’s in-house psychologists and court counsellors will first conduct a preliminary assessment on the party’s suspected mental health issue. They will then provide inputs to the Judge on whether the party will benefit from a referral to the Institute of Mental Health for medical examination and treatment, and facilitate the referral."
development plans for bedok stadium and bedok sports complex,"Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) whether there are any development plans for the Bedok Stadium and Bedok Sports Complex; and (b) if there are none, whether the running tracks within Bedok Stadium will be upgraded as their current condition poses safety concerns for users.","Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: In 2011, under the Housing and Development Board’s ""Remaking our Heartlands"" initiative for the East Coast area, the Bedok Sports Complex was identified for redevelopment as part of the upcoming ""Heartbeat@Bedok"" integrated complex, which will also house the Kampong Chai Chee Community Club, Bedok Public Library, Bedok Polyclinic, as well as other facilities. When ready, the sports facilities at Heartbeat@Bedok will comprise a sports hall, sheltered tennis courts, gymnasium, as well as aquatic facilities such as a sheltered swimming pool and interactive play pools. The development will be opening in phases at the end of this year.Bedok Stadium was last refurbished in 2002. Sport Singapore plans to replace the stadium’s running track by September 2017."
contamination rate of recyclables from household recycling,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether the Ministry can clarify what is (i) the contamination rate of recyclables from household recycling and (ii) the most common form of or reason for this contamination.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Under the National Recycling Programme (NRP), Public Waste Collectors (PWCs) are required to provide a blue co-mingled recycling bin at every HDB block and for all landed residential premises. Recycling receptacles must also be provided in condominium developments. This co-mingled recycling bin system under the NRP makes it convenient for residents as they do not have to spend additional time and effort to segregate the different types of recyclables (that is, paper, metal, plastic and glass) nor set aside space in their homes to store different types of recyclables separately.While much effort has been put into encouraging domestic recycling, our domestic recycling rate was only 19% in 2015. We need to work harder to achieve our target of a domestic recycling rate of 30% by 2030. This includes inculcating responsible recycling habits, such as preventing the contamination of recyclables in the co-mingled recycling bins by placing only items which can be recycled in such bins.According to the PWCs, about 40% of items found in the recycling bins have to be disposed of as they cannot be recycled. Some of the common non-recyclable items found deposited in recycling bins include soft toys and old shoes. Food waste found mixed with recyclables is another problem. Recyclables contaminated with food waste cannot be recycled and also create pest and odour problems.All co-mingled recycling bins in the NRP have clear labels that indicate what items can be recycled, such as clean paper, plastics, metal cans, glass and old clothing. Through public education programmes in schools and at grassroots events, my Ministry and the National Environment Agency strongly encourage everyone to contribute to our recycling efforts and to ensure that only items which are suitable for recycling are deposited in the co-mingled recycling bins."
updates on new and innovative technologies for hdb residents with lift access problems,"Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether there are updates on new and innovative technologies that can offer HDB residents, whose units are located in infrastructurally challenging positions, the lift access to their dwelling units; and (b) what is the proportion of such units within our HDB catchment.","Mr Lawrence Wong: The Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP) was launched in 2001 to provide direct lift access to flats and enhance convenience for residents, especially the elderly and less mobile. At the start of the programme, there were more than 5,300 HDB blocks without 100% lift access. Among them, more than 1,000 blocks were initially found to be unfeasible for LUP due to cost or technical constraints.Over the years, HDB has adopted innovative technical solutions and conducted some lift pilot trials to help such blocks with lift access. Some examples of these solutions that have been successfully implemented include lifts that do not have a machine room at the top of the shafts (that is, machine room-less elevators) and bubble lifts. In some blocks, HDB has also successfully reconfigured lift access with new entry points to residents’ homes. More recently, HDB piloted the Pneumatic Vacuum Elevator and the Vertical Platform Lift in an effort to offer LUP to more blocks. However, both solutions have been assessed to be unfeasible for heavy residential use, and will not be implemented in HDB estates.Through the various innovations solutions, the vast majority of the 5,300 blocks are now able to benefit from LUP. There remains only about 150 blocks where HDB has not found any solutions to overcome the existing constraints. On a flat basis, less than 1% of our sold flats do not have direct lift access. Singaporeans who are in urgent need of direct lift access due to medical conditions or disability may approach HDB for housing and financing assistance. HDB assesses each request on a case-by-case basis to see how best to render help."

proportion of unsuccessful first-time hdb bto flat applicants after fifth attempt,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked the Minister for National Development (a) what proportion of first-time applicants for HDB BTO flats have not succeeded in getting a unit after balloting for five times or more in the recent years; and (b) what are the main reasons for the unsuccessful attempts.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Most first-timer families who apply for a Build-To-Order (BTO) flat in the non-mature estates are able to book a flat within their first or second try, and definitely on their third try.Those who are unsuccessful in getting a flat after five or more attempts would have applied for BTO flats in the mature estates, or flats under the Sale of Balance Flats (SBF) exercises. Such flats have very high application rates, and lower chances of success in the ballot. Hence we encourage first-timer families to apply for BTO flats in non-mature estates, so that they can get their homes soon."
data on vacant or unused government properties and facilities,"Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for National Development what is the number, size and location of Government properties and facilities that are currently vacant or unused, including schools, institutes, factories and industrial facilities.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Based on returns collated from key Government agencies that own significant number of properties, there are around 1,000 government properties that are vacant. These properties are of various sizes and located all over Singapore.The properties are vacant for various reasons, such as in the process of being leased, under review for redevelopment, or pending demolition."
breakdown on number of foreign domestic workers in singapore from 13 source countries,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Manpower whether he can provide a breakdown of the current number of foreign domestic workers in Singapore from each of the 13 source countries.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: As of June 2016, there were 237,100 foreign domestic workers in Singapore. MOM does not provide a breakdown of the data by nationality."
water consumption and forthcoming price increase,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether there will be assistance for households who cannot cope with the forthcoming increase in the price of water; (b) what is the current percentage of households that are consuming more water than the national average; and (c) whether the Ministry has conducted a study on the water usage of non-residential facilities.,"14 Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources for the past 10 years, what has been the average number and percentage of households whose annual water consumption are below the national average, broken down by HDB flat types and private housing types respectively.15 Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources for the past 10 years, what has been the domestic water consumption per capita of Singapore compared to other First World countries.Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: In raising the water price to ensure sustainability in water supply, the Government will be providing assistance to help lower income households manage the price increase. Details on the revisions in water prices, and measures to assist households, will be announced by Minister (Finance) in the Budget Statement on 20 February 2017.Members have asked about water consumption by households and businesses. Currently, 45% of water demand is from the domestic sector, while 55% is from the non-domestic sector, which covers industries and commercial buildings.Today, the national average water consumption for households is 17 cubic metres of water per month, down from 19 cubic metres ten years ago. About 40% of households consume more water than the national average today, as was the case 10 years ago. [For more details on the monthly average water consumption by dwelling type, members may refer to the SP Services website.]If we look at per capita usage, households’ water consumption in Singapore is 148 litres per capita per day (LPCD). This is lower than that of Melbourne (159), London (155), New York City (476), Tokyo (220), and Hong Kong (211). But, we should not be complacent. We must continue to learn from other cities such as Copenhagen and Amsterdam, which have achieved lower LPCD levels of 101 and 136 respectively. Notwithstanding contextual differences such as climate, we can still save more water by adopting more water-saving habits and making use of more water-efficient appliances in our households.As for the non-domestic sector, PUB has since 2015 required the submission of Water Efficiency Management Plans (WEMP) for large water users that consume 60,000 cubic metres or more a year, equivalent to 24 Olympic-sized swimming pools. These plans help companies identify ways to reduce consumption. In 2016, more than 600 large water users have submitted their plans. With the data collected from WEMP, PUB will develop water efficiency benchmarks and good practice guidelines for water intensive sectors to help them further identify opportunities to improve water efficiency."
encouraging uptake of 'haze-free' cooking oil by restaurants,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources considering the ready availability of 'haze-free' cooking oil (or certified sustainable palm oil) in Singapore (a) whether the Government will consider subsidising its higher cost to increase the uptake by restaurants; and (b) what other methods the Ministry is considering to encourage its uptake.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The Ministry supports efforts by industries and non-governmental organisations to promote the use of certified sustainable palm oil (CSPO). Uncontrolled burning for land preparation is not permitted in the production of CSPO. Wider adoption of CSPO would help to reduce the likelihood of haze pollution in South East Asia where nearly 90% of the world’s palm oil is produced.Globally, the availability of CSPO is limited. The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), an internationally recognised certification body for sustainable palm oil, certifies only about 17% of the total palm oil produced globally. Emerging markets, such as China and India, account for nearly half of the global palm oil imports. We hope that greater awareness of the impact of unsustainable farming practices in the palm oil sector will encourage consumers to demand more CSPO. This is already happening in Europe, where companies and Governments have started to harmonise initiatives across countries to green the palm oil supply chain.The Ministry is pleased to see ground-up efforts in Singapore, by industries and non-government organisations (NGOs), to promote the adoption of CSPO. We support the mission of the Singapore Alliance on Sustainable Palm Oil (SASPO), founded by the World Wide Fund (WWF) Singapore, Unilever, Danone, Ayam Brand, IKEA and Wildlife Reserves Singapore. In addition, the Singapore Environment Council (SEC) has launched a new product category for products that contain palm oil under its Singapore Green Labelling Scheme (SGLS). Consumers can play a part by purchasing products with either the RSPO label or, in future, the SGLS label.We are heartened that Singapore’s biggest supermarket chain NTUC FairPrice carries CSPO products. The People’s Movement to Stop Haze (PM.Haze), a local NGO, has also produced a ""Haze-Free Cooking Oil"" Guide for local consumers and businesses to encourage them to make the switch to cooking oil from CSPO sources. Contrary to general perception, the price of CSPO cooking oil can be comparable to that of non-CSPO cooking oil.Together, we can work towards the vision of CSPO becoming the norm in Singapore and internationally."
reason for rise in littering cases,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what is the reason for the rise in littering resulting in more than 31,000 summons issued by NEA last year; (b) whether any analysis been done to understand the underlying cause; and (c) what is the Ministry doing to address this problem.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: A survey commissioned by the National Environment Agency (NEA) in 2010 found that around a third of Singaporeans would litter if they think they can get away with it. In addition, the survey found that while people realise that littering is an anti-social act, many still hold the false perception that throwing small items such as tissue papers and plastic wrappers does not constitute littering.To tackle the littering problem, NEA has stepped up enforcement against littering. Last year, NEA issued more than 31,000 tickets to littering offenders, about 18% more than in 2015. We have also enhanced the penalties for litterbugs. In April 2014, the Environmental Public Health Act (EPHA) was amended to double the maximum fines for littering to $2,000 for the first court conviction, $4,000 for the second conviction and $10,000 for the third and subsequent convictions. Repeat offenders would also be issued Corrective Work Orders.In 2013, NEA launched a Community Volunteer (CV) programme to foster greater ownership of the environment by engaging volunteers to encourage members of the public to bin their litter. More than 330 individuals have come on board the CV programme and engaged over 3,700 litterbugs.We have also been working with stakeholders such as the Public Hygiene Council (PHC) to encourage everyone to keep Singapore clean and inculcate a sense of responsibility toward our environment. The annual ""Operation WE Clean Up!"" is one such activity by the PHC which aims to galvanise the community through litter-picking activities across the island. The NEA and the PHC, together with partners such as the Singapore Kindness Movement, have also worked with the Ministry of Education (MOE) to encourage students to undertake daily cleaning in their schools, to inculcate a sense of responsibility among the students.The problem of littering cannot be solved just by enforcement or by the Government alone. Everyone has to take greater care of our environment and play a part in keeping Singapore clean."
primary 1 pupil data form,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Education (Schools) (a) when was the Primary 1 registration form (pupil data form) last updated; and (b) whether there are plans to update the form so as to modify the occupations listed for both parents to reflect the gender diversity in an increasing number of occupations.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: MOE periodically updates the Pupil Data Form, when necessary. It was last updated in 2016, to make changes to the declaration clause.The occupations listed in the form are those that have been more commonly reported by parents. Parents whose occupations are not listed can specify their occupation under ‘Others’.MOE is planning to digitise the form via an upcoming online portal for parents called Parents Gateway. As part of this shift, we are undertaking a comprehensive review of the various data fields in the form, including the lists of occupations for both parents."
criteria to operate spa with no massage services in residential areas,"Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for National Development (a) what are the criteria applied when URA considers whether to approve an application for the setting up of a business to operate as a spa with no massage services; and (b) in view of the risk that such businesses may end up providing massage services in contravention of the law, whether such businesses can be restricted from operating in/around residential areas.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Currently, all spas (with or without massage services) and massage parlours are considered as ""Massage Establishment (ME)"" use, and require a license or exemption under the Police licensing framework to operate. URA evaluates ME applications on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration land zoning, local planning intentions, and inputs from other agencies such as the Land Transport Authority for traffic considerations and the Police Licensing and Regulatory Department for vice-related concerns. Where the proposed siting of a ME is assessed to result in disamenities to the surroundings, the application will be rejected.In particular, only MEs given a Category I license or classified as Exempted under Police’s licensing framework can be considered for operation on commercial sites in residential areas. Category I MEs are subject to stringent qualifying criteria, including CaseTrust accreditation and a capital investment of at least $50,000. These conditions help to ensure that the applicant is willing to invest capital to run a legitimate massage business. The ""Exempted ME"" category is for activities that have minimal risk of causing vice or disamenities; examples include physiotherapy clinics and open-concept massage outlets.Should any ME be found to contravene the law, the Police will take enforcement action against the licensee, and revoke the ME license if necessary."
primary one students enrolled in after-school care and school-based student care centres,"Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for Education (Schools) (a) how many Primary One students are currently enrolled in after-school care; and (b) among these students, how many are enrolled in school-based Student Care Centres.","Mr Ng Chee Meng: Around 7,800 Primary 1 students are enrolled in Student Care Centres (SCCs) registered with the Ministry of Social and Family Development. Among these students, 4,800 are enrolled in school-based SCCs whilst the rest are enrolled in community-based SCCs.MOE has increased the number of school-based SCCs from less than 50 five years ago to 147 today. The overall enrolment has risen from 3,000 to more than 18,000 students. MOE will continue to expand the places in each school-based SCC and expand the number of schools with SCCs, at a pace that does not cause quality to be compromised."
update on certified early childhood educators in singapore,"Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for Education (Schools) (a) how many certified early childhood educators are there in Singapore; (b) how many are currently undergoing training; and (c) on average, how many are trained each year.","Mr Ng Chee Meng: There are about 16,000 certified early childhood educators as at end-2016. About 3,000 students are currently undergoing training. On average, about 1,800 students graduate from early childhood courses every year."
k2 enrollment in full-day childcare,Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for Social and Family Development how many children are currently enrolled in full-day childcare at the K2 level.,"Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: Today, more than 90% of Singaporean children aged 5 to 6 years old are enrolled in a pre-school. About 15,000 Singaporean children, or 45% of the cohort, were enrolled in a full-day pre-school programme at K2 level in 2016."
criteria for application of massage establishment licence in residential areas,"Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether the police conducts any additional checks or applies additional considerations when approving applications for a massage establishment licence to operate in/around residential areas; and (b) in view of the risk of vice-related activities being conducted at massage establishments, whether all massage establishments can be restricted from operating in/around residential areas.","Mr K Shanmugam: There are three different categories of Massage Establishments (ME) under Police’s licensing framework – Category I, Category II and Exempted MEs. Only MEs with a Category I licence, which has more stringent licencing conditions; or those under the ""Exempted"" category, which has low risk for vice activities, are allowed to operate in residential areas.Category I MEs are subject to more stringent qualifying criteria than Category II MEs. The criteria for Category I MEs include CaseTrust accreditation and a capital investment of at least $50,000. These conditions ensure that the applicant is a genuine business owner who is willing to invest capital to run a legitimate massage business.The ""Exempted ME"" category is for low-risk activities such as open-concept foot reflexology outlets and physiotherapy clinics. These MEs only need to register with the Police and are exempted from licensing. Exempted MEs are subject to strict operating conditions including no partitions or cubicles within the premises. In addition, all areas in the premises where massage services are carried out must be visible from outside the premises. Police may revoke the exemption of any ME that does not comply with the operating conditions.The Police assess each ME application on a case-by-case basis. The Police will consider other factors that are specific to an area such as the incidence of vice-related activities or any related law and order issues. Where there is information on vice in any ME, the Police will take enforcement action against the licensee, and revoke the ME licence.The ME licensing framework allows legitimate businesses to operate and serve customers in residential areas, while minimising the risk of crime and vice activities through stricter qualifying criteria and operating conditions. Police’s data shows that the majority of vice infringements are detected in unlicensed MEs, and not those which are regulated (i.e. licensed or exempted). The Ministry therefore has no plans to restrict all MEs from operating in residential areas."
persons appointed as non-resident ambassadors from 2011 to 2016,Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he can provide a list of the persons appointed by the Government as Non-Resident Ambassadors from 2011 to 2016.,"Dr Vivian Balakrishnan: There are 45 Non-Resident Ambassadors (NRAs) appointed between 2011 and 2016 who are still holding their appointments as of date. They are accredited to 48 countries and 4 International Organisations (UNESCO, Pacific Islands Forum, CARICOM and African Union). The names of these NRAs are published in the MFA website (https://www.mfa.gov.sg/content/mfa/missions/singapore_mission/mission_locator.html) which Ms Sylvia Lim could refer to for more details."
breakdown of expenditure incurred by grassroots organisation committees for fy2015/16,"Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth for FY2015/16 what is (i) the amount of expenditure incurred by grassroots organisations and (ii) the percentage share of this expense incurred by Citizens' Consultative Committees, Community Club Management Committees, Residents' Committees, Neighbourhood Committees, and others respectively.","Mr Chan Chun Sing (for the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth): For FY2015/2016, the total expenditure for Grassroots Organisations (GROs) was $206 million.The percentage breakdown of this expenditure is:"
extent of codeine substance abuse in singapore,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Health (a) how widespread is the abuse of codeine in Singapore; (b) which are the most vulnerable groups; and (c) what are the measures taken to address such codeine abuse in Singapore.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Codeine is used as a medicine for the relief of cough and pain. As codeine can be addictive, the supply of medicines containing codeine is monitored and controlled in a few ways.First, the manufacture, import and supply of medicines, including codeine cough preparations, is regulated by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA). Under HSA's Health Products Act, doctors and pharmacists can only supply to an individual patient not more than 240 ml of codeine cough preparation on any one occasion. They cannot supply to the same patient within a period of four days.Any person who violates the law can be fined up to $50,000 and/or jailed for up to two years under the Health Products Act.Second, as the professional body which regulates the conduct of doctors, the Singapore Medical Council (SMC) acts on complaints of errant prescribing or dispensation of codeine cough preparations. The SMC Ethical Code and Ethical Guidelines also provide guidance for doctors to prescribe or dispense drugs with potential for dependence or addiction. Doctors who breach the MOH guidelines or the SMC Ethical Code and Ethical Guidelines may face disciplinary action and be liable for suspension of between three months and a year, fine and censure.Third, HSA regulates the wholesale distribution of codeine cough preparations, and works closely with various enforcement agencies, such as the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) and the Singapore Police Force (SPF) to curb the illegal diversion of such preparations into the illegal market.Finally, to help reduce the demand for such preparations by codeine abusers and addicts, HSA has stepped up public education on the harm caused by codeine abuse through public advisories and press releases.From 2012 to 2016, HSA convicted 37 offenders and SMC disciplined 5 doctors for inappropriate prescribing of codeine cough preparations."
update on sme working capital loan scheme,Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (a) what is the number of applications and utilisation rate of the SME Working Capital Loan Scheme since its introduction in 2016; (b) whether SMEs face cash flow concerns or inability to obtain funding for their business growth; and (c) whether there are plans to enhance the attractiveness and availability of the scheme.,"Mr S Iswaran: The SME Working Capital Loan was announced at Budget 2016 to help viable SMEs access working capital and continue growing their businesses. The scheme complements existing Government loan schemes and commercial loans offered by financial institutions. Since its launch in June 2016 to December 2016, the SME Working Capital Loan has catalysed more than S$700 million in loans, benefiting approximately 4,300 SMEs.Based on the 2016 DP Information Group SME Development Survey, 96% of SMEs which applied for Government and commercial working capital term loans of five years and below were successful in their applications. This comprised 79% who received the full amount requested, and 17% who received partial approved amounts6.82% of the approved loans under the SME Working Capital Loan are less than the maximum quantum of S$300,000. The current scheme is therefore sufficient to meet the needs of most applicants. The Government has regular meetings with the financial institutions and chambers and associations to understand and monitor the financing needs of SMEs, and is prepared to provide greater assistance if necessary."
benefits of integrated healthcare clustering,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the average size that each integrated healthcare cluster will serve; (b) how does it compare to Hong Kong; (c) how will this new clustering benefit the public in expediting the waiting time at A&E departments; and (d) how will this improve the average waiting period for a patient who needs to be scanned for suspected serious illnesses like cancer.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Each cluster will serve a population of 1-1.5 million Singapore residents. This is comparable to Hong Kong, which also has healthcare clusters serving populations of 0.5-1.8 million each.Healthcare 2020 outlined our plan to expand capacity, improve quality and enhance the affordability of healthcare services. Even as we implement Healthcare 2020, we need to plan ahead further into the future. Last year, three key shifts to prepare for our healthcare needs beyond 2020 were announced beyond hospital to community, beyond quality to value and beyond healthcare to health. This transformation is necessary as our healthcare needs will grow in volume and complexity due to our ageing population and increased chronic disease burden. For this reason, we need to organise ourselves better so that we can implement the transformation more swiftly and decisively.The reorganisation will enable the integrated clusters to deliver more comprehensive and person-centered healthcare services that are appropriate and closer to the patients. This will help to reduce the need to access specialist care and the A&E at the hospitals.The reorganisation will also facilitate scaling up of programmes and services to benefit more Singaporeans. In addition, the integrated clusters will be able to offer their employees a wider and deeper range of professional development opportunities, and a broader platform for cross-learning that will benefit staff and ultimately our patients."
criteria for auto-renewal of community health assist scheme (chas) card,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) cards have been automatically renewed for households that do not respond to the invitation letter for renewal; (b) whether these households receive the same subsidy tier upon automatic renewal; and (c) whether the Ministry allows for auto-renewal to the same subsidy tier for retired senior citizens with no change in their household situation.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: A household’s eligibility for and level of subsidy under the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) depends on their latest household income or property Annual Value, as well as household composition. To ensure that households receive the correct level of subsidies, households are requested to submit a renewal application form every two years so that we can verify and update their latest household information.The Ministry of Health (MOH) seeks to make the renewal process convenient for CHAS cardholders. Households would receive a reminder letter about three months before their CHAS cards are due to expire. For those who do not respond, another renewal reminder letter is sent about one month before their CHAS cards expire. The renewal application form is included with the reminder letters. The application form is pre-filled based on our existing records, to make it simpler for households to update their household information.MOH also works with partners such as the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) to publicise information about the renewal process, as well as to reach out and provide any necessary assistance to individuals and households who may not be familiar with the renewal process. The CHAS application form is also available online, and at various locations such as polyclinics, public hospitals and Community Centres.We will continue to review the CHAS renewal process from time to time to ensure that it is convenient to the public and enables them to receive appropriate levels of subsidy based on their latest circumstances."
allocation and utilisation of activesg funds,"Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth as at 31 December 2016 (a) what has been the total amount of funds allocated for ActiveSG; (b) what is the size of the ActiveSG membership; (c) what is the total amount of ActiveSG dollars that have been (i) utilised (ii) extended (iii) forfeited; and (d) what happens to the forfeited and unconsumed portion of the allocated funds respectively.","Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: As at 31 December 2016, there were almost 1.2 million ActiveSG members. The budget for ActiveSG, including the operating budget for facilities such as sports stadia and swimming pools, was about $60 million.The complimentary $100 ActiveSG credits given to new members are intended to encourage members to kick-start an active lifestyle and for them to experience the various sports facilities and programmes. Thus far, almost three quarters of members have utilised their credits. The ActiveSG credits amounted to about $10 million in revenue forgone per year.Sport Singapore (SportSG) announced in November 2015 that the validity of the credits will be extended for another year, so long as the member uses them at least once in the last 12 months. More than 630,000 members benefited from the extension. About 150,000 members had their credits lapsed on 31 December 2016 despite email reminders."
impact of changes to smoking and cigarette sales laws on smoking and smokers,"Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked the Minister for Health with recent changes to the smoking and cigarette sales laws, whether there have been changes to the statistics on smoking and smokers, especially amongst women and teenagers.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Based on the Student Health Surveys which are conducted every three years, the prevalence of smoking among Secondary 1-4 students decreased from 8.6% in 2006 to 6.2% in 2009 but has remained at the same level in 2012. Although the rate fell to 2% based on the 2015 survey, there was a change in survey methodology and we are studying the data to better understand if this had an impact.Based on national health surveys which are also conducted once every three years, smoking amongst women increased from 3.7% in 2007 to 4.2% in 2010 and decreased slightly to 3.8% in 2013.Smoking prevalence is determined by complex socio-demographic factors as well as the various tobacco control measures introduced in recent years. My Ministry will continue to monitor smoking prevalence in Singapore, and further strengthen our tobacco control programme as part of a multi-pronged approach."
tax-free withdrawals from supplementary retirement scheme (srs) accounts,"Mr Yee Chia Hsing asked the Minister for Finance whether the Ministry can allow tax-free withdrawals from the Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) accounts to the extent where the SRS contributions do not benefit from any tax deduction due to the personal income tax relief cap of $80,000 that will be effective from the Year of Assessment 2018.","Mr Heng Swee Keat: All personal income tax reliefs, including SRS contributions made on or after 1 January 2017, are subject to an annual cap on personal income tax relief of $80,000 from Year of Assessment 2018. This cap on personal income tax relief preserves the progressivity and fairness of our tax structure.SRS members are advised to evaluate whether they would benefit from tax relief on their SRS contributions, and make an informed decision on whether to make the contribution in the first place. Generally, those who have reached their personal income tax relief cap can place their monies in the same investments outside of the SRS, and can enjoy the same tax treatment on the gains from these investments. This achieves the same outcome as the Member's suggestion to allow tax-free withdrawals from the SRS when the contributions do not benefit from tax relief."
blue and orange chas cards issued in 2015 and 2016,Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for Health how many blue CHAS cards and orange CHAS cards were issued by the Government in 2015 and 2016 respectively.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: 290,000 Blue and 170,000 Orange CHAS cards were issued in 2015, while 400,000 Blue and 240,000 Orange cards were issued in 2016."
statistics on licensed insurance companies/agencies from 2007 to 2016,"Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Prime Minister for each of the years from 2007 to 2016, what is (i) the number of insurance companies/agencies with a valid licence operating in Singapore (ii) the number of staff on full-time employment by all these insurance companies/agencies and (iii) the number of insurance agents engaged by all these insurance companies/agencies.",Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): The statistics are set out in the Table below3:
usage of family visiting privileges by drug rehabilitation centre (drc) inmates,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Home Affairs for each year of the past three years (a) what percentage of inmates in the Drug Rehabilitation Centres (DRCs) use their entire quota of family visiting privileges each month; and (b) how many requests have the DRCs received for additional family visiting privileges by the inmates or by their family members respectively.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The percentage of inmates in the Drug Rehabilitation Centres (DRCs) who received the maximum allowable two visits per month is as follows:Requests for additional family visits by DRC inmates or their family members are rare. When requests for additional visits are made, the Singapore Prison Service would assess each request and grant the visit based on the circumstances of the request."
application fee for enforcement of money order issued by small claims tribunal,"Ms Tin Pei Ling asked the Minister for Law (a) whether a claimant has to pay a fee to apply for the enforcement of a money order issued by the Small Claims Tribunal and, if so, how much; and (b) whether there are measures in place to help a low-income claimant defray this cost.","Mr K Shanmugam: Legal costs for proceedings at the Small Claims Tribunals are kept low as the process is straightforward and parties appear in person. A Money Order issued by the Tribunals is deemed to be a Magistrates' Court Order, and can be enforced through a Writ of Seizure and Sale.The filing fee for a Writ of Seizure and Sale to enforce the Tribunals' order is to be paid by the claimant unless the Court orders otherwise. Currently, the filing fee is $80, which is about half the fee for a case filed under the Magistrates' Court. In addition, there are other associated and ancillary fees, which may bring the total cost of enforcing the Tribunals' Money Order to about $400 to $600. The claimant can recover these enforcement costs from the judgment debtor if the judgment debtor's personal property is successfully seized and sold, and the proceeds of sale are sufficient to cover the costs incurred.The claimant may also apply to the Registrar of the State Courts to waive or defer the payment of such costs.The Registrar will consider all the relevant facts in the specific case, including the claimant's financial circumstances, in deciding whether to waive or defer such fees. The claimant will not be charged a fee for making a waiver or deferment application.The Legal Aid Bureau may also provide legal aid for the execution of a Writ of Seizure and Sale, provided that the applicant satisfies the requisite means and merits tests."
appointment considerations for heads of overseas missions,Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs (a) what proportion and number of Singapore's current Heads of Overseas Missions are career diplomats and political appointees respectively; and (b) what are the specific considerations to determine which Missions will be headed by career diplomats as opposed to political appointees.,"Dr Vivian Balakrishnan: No resident Heads of Overseas Missions are political appointees. All our resident Ambassadors are Foreign Service Officers, recruited and appointed strictly based on merit, like the entire Foreign Service and indeed Civil Service.Our diplomats operate in a challenging and uncertain global environment. They are expected to robustly defend and advance Singapore’s interests in the international arena. To build the strongest possible team of diplomats for Singapore, the Foreign Service recruits both fresh graduates and mid-career professionals through rigorous recruitment processes. In particular, mid-career officers are considered based on their past experience, performance and relevant skillsets. Appointments of senior Foreign Service Officers are also subject to approval by the Special Personnel Board in the Civil Service or Public Service Commission. Currently, about 10% of Ambassador-level Heads of Missions joined MFA mid-career.Our guiding principle is to appoint the best person for the job, whether he or she has joined the Foreign Service as a fresh graduate or mid-career recruit. We will not allow any compromise to the professionalism and excellence of our Foreign Service."
update on case of eight deported indonesian isis suspects,Mr Ang Wei Neng asked the Minister for Home Affairs if he can provide an update on the case of eight Indonesians deported to Malaysia due to their suspected link to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and why they were subsequently released by the Indonesian police.,"Mr K Shanmugam: On 9 January 2017, a group of eight Indonesians tried to enter Singapore through the Woodlands Checkpoint. The Indonesians were referred for secondary checks by ICA officers when they presented themselves for immigration clearance. One of them said that he was a religious teacher and that his travelling companions were his students. He was found to possess images of security concern, including that of a shoe-bomb and fighters from the terrorist group that calls itself the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). The group was denied entry into Singapore and turned back to Malaysia from where they last departed.The Malaysian authorities repatriated the Indonesians back to their country of origin after they had completed their investigations. It is the prerogative of the Indonesian authorities to decide on the course of action to take with regards to their citizens.On our part, we have shared our investigation findings on the case with our Malaysian and Indonesian counterparts. We will continue to watch our borders closely and work with our partners to counter the terrorism threat in the region."
total subsidised and private nursing home capacity,"Ms Tin Pei Ling asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the current total subsidised and private nursing home capacity; (b) in the past five years, how many applications for these nursing homes have been received and what has been the queue time in each of those years; and (c) within the same period, how many of the patients in these nursing homes are ambulant and how many can be cared for at home or within the community.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: We have about 12,800 nursing home beds as at end-December 2016. Of these, about 11,000 beds are subsidised.Between 2012 and 2016, the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) received an average of 3,400 applications for subsidised nursing home beds per year. The waiting time depends on several factors such as care needs of patients, family preferences and available capacity. On average, successful applicants wait about four months for a subsidised nursing home bed.Very few nursing home residents are ambulant. This is because in assessing the needs of applicants, AIC generally prioritises nursing home placements for patients who require help and supervision in three or more activities of daily living such as feeding and toileting, and have weak family support. For seniors who are ambulant and can be supported in the community, AIC refers them for home-based and community services instead. We are strengthening these services to enable more seniors to age in place, rather than be cared for in a nursing home. In 2016, more than 6,000 seniors were placed in home care and/or day care."
processes involved in producing weekly muis friday prayer sermon text,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (a) what are the processes involved in producing the weekly MUIS Friday prayer sermon text; (b) who determines or approves the final draft of the sermon text; and (c) whether the sermon text has to be vetted and approval obtained from the Ministry of Home Affairs as well as the Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs prior to its delivery.,"Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim: The weekly sermon text is written by the Office of the Mufti in MUIS under the guidance of the Mufti. The themes for the sermons are based on an annual framework developed by the Office of the Mufti.The Office of the Mufti seeks public feedback, including through an annual survey, on the topics for the sermons. Such feedback helps ensure that MUIS continues to provide religious content that is relevant to issues faced by Muslims in Singapore.The Office of the Mufti is entirely responsible for the sermon texts. They do not seek approval from other government agencies or ministries. Although MUIS is a statutory board, the Government does not dictate how MUIS should administer matters relating to religious doctrine."
prison inmates with identified intellectual disabilities and their recidivism rate,"Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) how many prison inmates are there currently with identified intellectual disabilities, with a breakdown by type and severity of intellectual disability; (b) what is the overall recidivism rate of this group of offenders; and (c) how does this compare with the recidivism rate of able-bodied, neuro-typical offenders with similar offences.","Mr K Shanmugam: The Singapore Prison Service (SPS) will assess every inmate upon admission to understand whether they have any condition, for example, medical, physical or intellectual disability, which may require special attention. Depending on the individual’s profile and needs, SPS would tailor the management approach and rehabilitation programmes for the inmate such as housing arrangements, where this is practicable.SPS does not currently collate detailed data on the overall number, profile and recidivism rate of inmates with intellectual disabilities. It plans to do so going forward."
minimum compassionate leave for children and grandchildren,"Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Ministry will consider mandating a minimum number of days of compassionate leave for children and grandchildren in view of the limited number of days of annual leave, particularly for those working in junior positions or lower paying jobs, smaller families and our rapidly ageing population.","Mr Lim Swee Say: We recognise that employees need our support during the time of bereavement. Already more than nine in 10 companies (92%) provide compassionate leave based on MOM's survey in 2016. We will continue to work with our tripartite partners to encourage employers to voluntarily adopt such progressive workplace practices.The Government has introduced several family leave enhancements over the last few years. We should allow time for businesses to adjust and adapt. At this stage, we have no plans to make it mandatory for all firms to provide specifically for compassionate leave for their employees."
additional nursing home beds from 2021 to 2030,Ms Tin Pei Ling asked the Minister for Health (a) how many nursing home beds will be added from January 2021 to December 2030; and (b) how much of the expected demand will be fulfilled by 2020 and 2030 respectively given our ageing population.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: MOH plans for nursing home capacity to meet projected demand based on a combination of factors, such as demographics and incidence of disability. We have increased our capacity from 9,400 beds in 2011 to 12,800 beds today, and will develop more nursing homes to reach a total of 17,000 beds by 2020. This is expected to meet the demand for nursing homes in 2020.Beyond 2020, we will continue to add more nursing home capacity. However, the number of beds added will have to be constantly reviewed and calibrated as demand patterns change. We are also meeting seniors' care needs holistically in different ways. Even as we continue to build more nursing homes, we are also focusing on upstream efforts to keep Singaporeans healthy, and growing our suite of home and community care services to help seniors age in place."
management of food wastage through schools and neighbourhood communities,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether the Ministry will be working with schools to raise awareness about food wastage and ways to manage the issue; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider setting up a network of food banks within communities so that households with excess food items can donate them via these neighbourhood food banks.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: My Ministry works closely with schools to raise awareness on the importance of reducing food wastage. The National Environment Agency (NEA) supports schools by providing educational resources such as posters, videos and presentation materials on food waste reduction.Later this year, the NEA will implement a two-year food waste reduction and recycling project for schools. Under this project which will involve 10 schools, emphasis will first be placed on reducing the amount of food waste produced and then on recycling the remaining food waste using on-site food waste recycling machines. There will be assembly talks on managing food waste in participating schools and training will also be provided on the proper segregation of food waste for recycling to the schools' staff, students and canteen stall-holders. In addition, they will host learning journeys for neighbouring schools and their community partners to share about their food waste reduction and recycling efforts. Apart from raising awareness about food wastage, the project will demonstrate the benefits of proper food waste management to other schools and encourage them to set up similar systems.Currently, food redistribution organisations such as The Food Bank Singapore, Food from the Heart and Fei Yue Community Services accept donations of excess food items from households. For example, The Food Bank Singapore currently has 15 collection points for households to drop off their food items. As these organisations are located within the communities, they are able to channel food efficiently to those in need. My Ministry will continue to support these organisations' efforts on food redistribution and encourage companies and households to donate their excess food to them.While food redistribution is one step towards reducing food waste, we should move upstream to avoid generating food waste in the first place. The NEA has developed a food wastage reduction guide for households with a wide range of useful tips on how to reduce food wastage, such as planning food purchases to avoid having to throw out expired food items that are not consumed.To raise awareness and minimise food wastage in the community, my Ministry works with the Community Development Councils (CDCs) and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs). For example, the NEA has partnered the South East district on the 'Eco-Kepalas @ South East Organisations' programme and North East district on the 'I Love My Food' initiative to encourage households to reduce food wastage."
measures taken to manage e-waste,"Mr Chen Show Mao asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what measures are being taken to encourage consumers and waste management companies to adhere to environmentally sound practices in managing e-waste; (b) how effective have these measures been; and (c) whether the Government will consider establishing strict guidelines on e-waste collection, disposal and recycling for consumers, businesses and waste management companies.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Electrical and electronic waste (e-waste) is a key waste stream in Singapore. Approximately 60,000 tonnes of e-waste is generated in Singapore each year. E-waste contains valuable and scarce materials, but also small amounts of hazardous substances such as mercury and cadmium. The release of such substances into the environment may pose pollution and health problems.To encourage environmentally sound management of e-waste, my Ministry supports voluntary recycling programmes such as REcycling Nation's Electronic Waste (RENEW), which is led by Starhub, DHL and recycler TES-AMM. Under this programme, consumers can place their e-waste in bright green e-waste recycling bins which are conveniently located in shopping malls and commercial buildings. The e-waste will then be collected by DHL and delivered to TES-AMM. RENEW, which is an expansion and replacement of its predecessor StarHub E-waste Recycling Programme, now covers almost 280 locations around Singapore. Since 2012, these programmes have collected and recycled about 110 tonnes of e-waste. Businesses that want to recycle their e-waste, can participate in the HP Planet Partners Programme or Dell Recycling Programme. The e-waste collected is sent to e-waste recycling facilities, which are subjected to pollution control requirements.As the amount of e-waste generated in Singapore is likely to increase as technological advancement leads to faster product replacement, my Ministry has been exploring options for a comprehensive nationwide system for the collection, disposal and recycling of e-waste.The National Environment Agency (NEA) commissioned a study in March 2016 to develop possible options for an e-waste management system. The ongoing study includes a survey of the entire e-waste collection and recycling value chain, including treatment and disposal. In addition, consultations were conducted in October and November 2016 to seek industry's views on elements of an e-waste management framework. The results from the study and industry consultations are expected to be released this year."
statistics on time taken by institutes of higher learning graduates to secure full-time employment,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (a) what is the average and median time taken for graduates of institutions of higher learning to secure full-time employment; (b) whether the time taken is lengthened with the economic slowdown; and (c) what are the steps taken to help these graduates find employment.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: The Ministry of Education does not measure the statistics as requested by the Member. Instead, the Graduate Employment Survey (GES), conducted by the Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) annually, provides an indication of the employment outcomes of graduates six months after the completion of their final examinations.For 2016 fresh and post-National Service Polytechnic graduates, the overall employment rates were 90.6% and 95.4% respectively, slightly higher than 88.9% and 91.5% in 2015. Full-time permanent employment rates for the fresh and post-National Service Polytechnic graduates in 2016 were 55.8% and 70.1% respectively, also comparable to 2015 figures. Many Polytechnic graduates chose to work in part-time/temporary jobs as they prepared to commence further studies.The results of the 2016 GES for Autonomous Universities (AUs) are being tabulated. Based on the 2015 GES results, the overall employment rate six months after graduation was 89.5%; full-time permanent employment rate was 83.1%.The IHLs have in place various programmes and initiatives to help fresh graduates find employment after graduation. For example, education and career guidance are provided to students to broaden their awareness of the jobs and careers available. The IHLs also organise annual career fairs for graduating students, and provide resources to help graduating students as well as fresh graduates in their job search. Workforce Singapore (WSG) programmes and initiatives are also extended to fresh graduates to help those who require more support in their job search."
breakdown of expenditure incurred by grassroots organisation committees for fy2015/16,"Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth for FY2015/16 what is (i) the amount of expenditure incurred by grassroots organisations and (ii) the percentage share of this expense incurred by Citizens' Consultative Committees, Community Club Management Committees, Residents' Committees, Neighbourhood Committees, and others respectively.","Mr Chan Chun Sing (for the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth): For FY2015/2016, the total expenditure for Grassroots Organisations (GROs) was $206 million.The percentage breakdown of this expenditure is:"
nationwide study on employment for persons with disabilities and special needs,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Social and Family Development whether the Ministry will conduct a comprehensive nationwide study on the employment rate and employment conditions of persons with disabilities and special needs, with a focus on finding out the employment difficulties they face and how their salaries compare to other workers with similar qualifications.","Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: Employment is integral to enabling persons with disabilities to live independently and integrate with society. In 2013, SG Enable (SGE) was set up to enhance employability and employment options for persons with disability. SGE works with voluntary welfare organisations to seek out employment opportunities for persons with disabilities and to place and support them in these jobs.Over the past two years, SGE and its partners have collectively placed more than 1,000 persons with disabilities into employment. SGE has also supported internships for about 75 tertiary students with disabilities in our Institutes of Higher Learning. Employment support for persons with disabilities range from training for employability, to job placement and support, to working with employers to put in place arrangements for better integration.Through these employment support efforts, SGE has gained a better understanding of the needs and challenges of persons with disabilities seeking employment. With this knowledge, SGE will continue to render timely and customised support to persons with disabilities in seeking and sustaining employment.Persons with disabilities comprise about 0.55% of the resident labour force. 60% of them tap on the various employment support schemes ranging from transportation subsidy, income supplement and training support. These persons with disabilities are mainly employed in the hospitality, food and beverage, wholesale and retail and administrative support sectors. Their median monthly gross wage ranged from $1,000 to $2,800.MSF will continue to explore means of capturing information on the employment status and conditions of persons with disabilities, so that we have a more complete picture of the situation, and can better support them as part of our diverse workforce."
complaints received by bca against managing agents of management corporations of strata titles (mcsts),Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether there is an increasing trend over the last five years on the number of complaints received by BCA on managing agents of Management Corporations of Strata Title (MCSTs) over their non-delivery of service or compliance; and (b) whether there are processes in place to ensure only managing agents of MCSTs with the necessary credentials are allowed to operate their business.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: We have not seen an increase in the number of complaints received about service standards of managing agents (MAs). BCA receives about 30 cases of such feedback annually. This number has been consistent over the last five years.MCSTs have the flexibility to appoint MA firms that best serve their needs. To aid them in their choice, MCSTs can select from a list of MA firms accredited under the voluntary Accredited Managing Agent (AMA) scheme. This scheme is jointly administered by two industry associations - the Singapore Institute of Surveyors and Valuers, and the Association of Property and Facility Managers. Accredited firms are required to have staff who are trained in recognised estate or building management courses, and who also possess sufficient experience and knowledge in property and strata management.To help raise the overall competency of MAs, the BCA Academy also offers courses covering the strata management framework and relevant rules and regulations. We encourage MAs to make use of these training opportunities."
specialist team for attempted suicide cases,Mr Kok Heng Leun asked the Minister for Social and Family Development whether the Ministry will consider having a specialist team who provides psychological support and mental health expertise to go with the police when the police responds to cases of attempted suicide.,"Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: Singapore adopts an inter-agency, multi-pronged approach to address suicides through promoting upstream prevention, encouraging help seeking behaviour, providing support to at-risk groups, and offering crisis intervention and support.For cases of attempted suicide, the priority is to ensure the immediate safety of the person attempting suicide. The Police are thus activated as the first responder to attend to the crisis situation immediately.Police officers will, when they notice signs of suicidal tendencies, recommend the appropriate follow-up including engaging the next-of-kin to assist in caring for the person, or referring the case to the Samaritans of Singapore for counselling. If there are signs indicating possible mental instability, the Police may refer the person to the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) for an assessment of the person’s mental state, and treatment if necessary.The current staged approach works well and it rightfully prioritises the immediate safety of the person attempting suicide. Time taken to mobilise a larger team, including psychological and mental health experts, may delay our response."
allocation and utilisation of activesg funds,"Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth as at 31 December 2016 (a) what has been the total amount of funds allocated for ActiveSG; (b) what is the size of the ActiveSG membership; (c) what is the total amount of ActiveSG dollars that have been (i) utilised (ii) extended (iii) forfeited; and (d) what happens to the forfeited and unconsumed portion of the allocated funds respectively.","Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: As at 31 December 2016, there were almost 1.2 million ActiveSG members.

More than 630,000 members benefited from the extension. About 150,000 members had their credits lapsed on 31 December 2016 despite email reminders."
fake food imports detected,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for National Development (a) how many cases of fake food imported from overseas have been detected by AVA over the past three years; (b) what is the breakdown of the country of origin in these cases; and (c) what action has been taken against the suppliers.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA) has not detected any cases of fake food products in Singapore to date. Fake food is defined as food that is made from ingredients that are not edible and can be hazardous when consumed.The Government places great importance in ensuring that our food is safe. In addition to sampling food imports for safety tests, AVA also conducts checks to ensure that food is accurately labelled. From 2014 to 2016, AVA took enforcement action against 26 cases of mislabelling of food products, including honey, black moss and chai seeds. The traders involved were warned or fined, and required to correct the labels.The maximum penalty for importing fake food or mislabelling food products is a fine not exceeding $10,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months or both."
tax-free withdrawals from supplementary retirement scheme (srs) accounts,"Mr Yee Chia Hsing asked the Minister for Finance whether the Ministry can allow tax-free withdrawals from the Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) accounts to the extent where the SRS contributions do not benefit from any tax deduction due to the personal income tax relief cap of $80,000 that will be effective from the Year of Assessment 2018.","Mr Heng Swee Keat: All personal income tax reliefs, including SRS contributions made on or after 1 January 2017, are subject to an annual cap on personal income tax relief of $80,000 from Year of Assessment 2018.

Under this project which will involve 10 schools, emphasis will first be placed on reducing the amount of food waste produced and then on recycling the remaining food waste using on-site food waste recycling machines. There will be assembly talks on managing food waste in participating schools and training will also be provided on the proper segregation of food waste for recycling to the schools' staff, students and canteen stall-holders. In addition, they will host learning journeys for neighbouring schools and their community partners to share about their food waste reduction and recycling efforts. Apart from raising awareness about food wastage, the project will demonstrate the benefits of proper food waste management to other schools and encourage them to set up similar systems.Currently, food redistribution organisations such as The Food Bank Singapore, Food from the Heart and Fei Yue Community Services accept donations of excess food items from households. For example, The Food Bank Singapore currently has 15 collection points for households to drop off their food items. As these organisations are located within the communities, they are able to channel food efficiently to those in need. My Ministry will continue to support these organisations' efforts on food redistribution and encourage companies and households to donate their excess food to them.While food redistribution is one step towards reducing food waste, we should move upstream to avoid generating food waste in the first place. The NEA has developed a food wastage reduction guide for households with a wide range of useful tips on how to reduce food wastage, such as planning food purchases to avoid having to throw out expired food items that are not consumed.To raise awareness and minimise food wastage in the community, my Ministry works with the Community Development Councils (CDCs) and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs). For example, the NEA has partnered the South East district on the 'Eco-Kepalas @ South East Organisations' programme and North East district on the 'I Love My Food' initiative to encourage households to reduce food wastage."
measures taken to manage e-waste,"Mr Chen Show Mao asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what measures are being taken to encourage consumers and waste management companies to adhere to environmentally sound practices in managing e-waste; (b) how effective have these measures been; and (c) whether the Government will consider establishing strict guidelines on e-waste collection, disposal and recycling for consumers, businesses and waste management companies.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Electrical and electronic waste (e-waste) is a key waste stream in Singapore. Approximately 60,000 tonnes of e-waste is generated in Singapore each year. E-waste contains valuable and scarce materials, but also small amounts of hazardous substances such as mercury and cadmium. The release of such substances into the environment may pose pollution and health problems.To encourage environmentally sound management of e-waste, my Ministry supports voluntary recycling programmes such as REcycling Nation's Electronic Waste (RENEW), which is led by Starhub, DHL and recycler TES-AMM. Under this programme, consumers can place their e-waste in bright green e-waste recycling bins which are conveniently located in shopping malls and commercial buildings. The e-waste will then be collected by DHL and delivered to TES-AMM. RENEW, which is an expansion and replacement of its predecessor StarHub E-waste Recycling Programme, now covers almost 280 locations around Singapore. Since 2012, these programmes have collected and recycled about 110 tonnes of e-waste. Businesses that want to recycle their e-waste, can participate in the HP Planet Partners Programme or Dell Recycling Programme. The e-waste collected is sent to e-waste recycling facilities, which are subjected to pollution control requirements.As the amount of e-waste generated in Singapore is likely to increase as technological advancement leads to faster product replacement, my Ministry has been exploring options for a comprehensive nationwide system for the collection, disposal and recycling of e-waste.The National Environment Agency (NEA) commissioned a study in March 2016 to develop possible options for an e-waste management system. The ongoing study includes a survey of the entire e-waste collection and recycling value chain, including treatment and disposal. In addition, consultations were conducted in October and November 2016 to seek industry's views on elements of an e-waste management framework. The results from the study and industry consultations are expected to be released this year."
considerations for replacement of bathroom doors in new hdb residential developments,Ms Sun Xueling asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether there has been an assessment on the practicality of providing wooden laminated doors for HDB bathrooms given usage patterns; and (b) whether HDB will consider replacing the wooden laminated doors with aluminium bi-fold doors for the bathrooms of new HDB residential developments.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB has provided laminated timber bathroom doors for standard BTO flats since 2001. These doors have undergone performance tests, including repeated wetting and drying cycle tests, and meet the requisite industry standards for use.However, depending on their usage habits, some residents could find such timber doors unsuitable; for example, in bathrooms where the door could be frequently splashed with water due to floor washing, bathing patterns or lack of shower screen. In such cases, deterioration would appear over time.It is thus the flat owners' responsibility to use and maintain the doors properly. Nonetheless, if issues with the laminated timber doors occur within the one-year Defects Liability Period (DLP), HDB will perform rectification, which may include one-for-one replacement.Separately, HDB has been carrying out studies on new bathroom door options as part of its regular effort to keep flat fitting designs up to date. One new option is laminated UPVC folding doors. These doors are durable, easy to maintain, and offer a modern timber look and feel that complements the bedroom doors. They are also more resistant to fungus growth. Since November 2015, HDB has introduced laminated UPVC folding doors for bathrooms in new public housing development launches."
statistics on time taken by institutes of higher learning graduates to secure full-time employment,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (a) what is the average and median time taken for graduates of institutions of higher learning to secure full-time employment; (b) whether the time taken is lengthened with the economic slowdown; and (c) what are the steps taken to help these graduates find employment.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: The Ministry of Education does not measure the statistics as requested by the Member. Instead, the Graduate Employment Survey (GES), conducted by the Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) annually, provides an indication of the employment outcomes of graduates six months after the completion of their final examinations.For 2016 fresh and post-National Service Polytechnic graduates, the overall employment rates were 90.6% and 95.4% respectively, slightly higher than 88.9% and 91.5% in 2015. Full-time permanent employment rates for the fresh and post-National Service Polytechnic graduates in 2016 were 55.8% and 70.1% respectively, also comparable to 2015 figures. Many Polytechnic graduates chose to work in part-time/temporary jobs as they prepared to commence further studies.The results of the 2016 GES for Autonomous Universities (AUs) are being tabulated. Based on the 2015 GES results, the overall employment rate six months after graduation was 89.5%; full-time permanent employment rate was 83.1%.The IHLs have in place various programmes and initiatives to help fresh graduates find employment after graduation. For example, education and career guidance are provided to students to broaden their awareness of the jobs and careers available. The IHLs also organise annual career fairs for graduating students, and provide resources to help graduating students as well as fresh graduates in their job search. Workforce Singapore (WSG) programmes and initiatives are also extended to fresh graduates to help those who require more support in their job search."
impact of selective en bloc redevelopment scheme (sers) on community social capital,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for National Development whether there has been a study done or planned on (i) the degree of preference of Singaporeans to sink deep roots in a local community as opposed to having to move out under the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS) with no guarantee of relocation in the vicinity and (ii) the erosion of social capital when people who have lived in the area for a long time and contributed to the community move out under SERS.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Under the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS), residents move en bloc to a new precinct nearby, preserving the existing community ties built over the years. HDB has also put in place the Joint Selection Scheme, where up to six households affected by SERS can book their new replacement flats together, to continue living near their old neighbours.HDB conducts a biennial survey to gauge residents’ level of support and satisfaction for SERS, including the extent to which SERS has impacted their family and community ties. Over the years, our surveys have consistently shown a strong support level for SERS, at 85% or more, with residents affirming benefits such as having a brand new living environment, being able to move nearby and with their old neighbours."
guidelines for schools on retention of prizes won during competitions,"Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Education (Schools) whether there is a policy to guide schools in deciding on the retention of prizes, especially cash prizes or those with cash value, won by students representing the schools during competitions.","Mr Ng Chee Meng: Schools set their own internal guidelines in managing prizes won by student representatives in competitions. This is done based on factors such as the school's education philosophy, type of prizes and competition rules.Some schools have a practice that book vouchers are shared equally amongst team members. When cash prizes are given, winners may be encouraged to donate a portion of the cash to support needy students or for their own Co-curricular Activity (CCA). This inculcates in our students a sense of gratitude to the larger community supporting them in the competition, and to pay it forward to benefit fellow students through the school programmes.The preparation for, and experience of the competition are the most valuable aspects. This is the educational value the students gain irrespective of prizes won. We will remind schools to explain the purpose of their management of cash prizes to students and parents clearly."
applicants above income cap for rental flats,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for National Development for each year of the past three years (a) how many applicants above the income cap for rental flats have applied for rental flats; and (b) how many of such applications have been approved.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB exercises flexibility for deserving households who do not meet the eligibility criteria, such as the income ceiling, to rent a flat from HDB on a case-by-case basis.Between 2014 and 2016, about 1,900 households requested for a waiver of the income ceiling criterion, of which 273 applications were approved. The other applicants were assessed to be able to afford other housing options, or had family support."
"employment eligibility in police, auxiliary police and private security industry","Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether the Government has changed its policy on restricting eligibility for employment in the police, auxiliary police and private security industry to Singaporeans, permanent residents and Malaysians; (b) if so, which additional source countries have been approved for each of the three sectors respectively, and from which effective dates; and (c) what is the prevailing quota or dependency ratio ceiling set by the Government, if any, for the employment of foreigners to Singaporeans for each sector respectively.","Mr K Shanmugam: The Singapore Police Force’s current practice has been to recruit Singaporeans and Permanent Residents (PRs) as police officers. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) requires the majority of Auxiliary Police Officers (APOs) in the Auxiliary Police Forces (APFs) and security officers in the private security industry to be Singaporeans. The APFs and security companies are also required to adhere to the dependency ratio ceiling set by MOM. For APOs, Malaysia had been the only approved foreign source country.Demand for APOs is growing due to new infrastructure such as Changi Airport Terminal 4 and Tuas Terminal, and heightened security threats. It is estimated that another 600 APOs will be required over the next few years. The APFs have indicated that they will not be able to recruit sufficient suitable Singaporeans to meet this projected demand. In the last five years, despite their best efforts the APFs have only been able to expand the pool of Singaporean APOs by 250 officers.To meet the growing demand, APFs are exploring Taiwan as a possible source for APOs. MHA has decided to allow the APFs to recruit Taiwanese APOs to supplement the current pool of Singaporean and Malaysian APOs.These Taiwanese APOs are required to meet the same training, education and physical fitness criteria as imposed on Singaporean and Malaysian APOs. In addition, the Taiwanese APOs must be able to communicate in English and pass an English proficiency test. Their specific deployment will be determined based on our risk assessment and operational requirements.MHA will assess and review the performance of the Taiwanese APOs after they have been deployed for a period of time."
source of distributed denial of service attack on starhub in october 2016,Mr Leon Perera asked the Prime Minister (a) whether the Cyber Security Agency (CSA) has identified the possible source responsible for the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack on StarHub in October 2016; (b) what response the CSA and the Government intend to take against the person or entities responsible; and (c) what steps the CSA and the Government intend to take to prevent and mitigate similar attacks in future.,"Mr Lee Hsien Loong: The Infocommunications Media Development Authority (IMDA) takes a serious view of the disruptions to StarHub’s residential broadband services on 22 and 24 October 2016. Joint investigations by IMDA and the Cyber Security Agency (CSA) are nearing completion, and findings will be released soon.Cybersecurity is increasingly important, given Singapore’s reliance on digital technologies and the interconnectedness of digital systems. Collective effort from the Government, industry and the public is needed to build a resilient and trusted cyber environment.As the regulatory authority for the telecommunications sector, IMDA places stringent standards and requirements on our Internet Service Providers to ensure that their networks are resilient against cyber disruptions. Companies too, must ensure that they have robust and resilient systems, and measures to quickly detect and respond to any disruptions, to minimise the inconvenience to their customers. Users of Internet-connected devices should also adopt good cyber hygiene practices to secure their devices. While there is no fool-proof solution, we must all work together to strengthen our cyber resilience."
taxi driver's vocational licence (tdvl) re-application criteria,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for Transport what are the conditions for re-application or re-qualification for a Taxi Driver's Vocational Licence (TDVL) where the TDVL has been revoked due to the conviction of a criminal offence that is unrelated to road traffic and/or driving matters.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Land Transport Authority (LTA) considers the nature of the offence when assessing the re-applications of ex-offenders for a Taxi Driver Vocational License (TDVL), with a view to protecting the safety of passengers. Those who have committed extremely serious offences, such as rape, murder or kidnapping, are barred from re-obtaining a TDVL for life. Those who have committed less serious offences like housebreaking are barred for three to five years from the date of conviction, after which their re-applications will be considered. Other offences which do not pose any danger to the physical safety of the public, such as forgery, would not attract any debarment.This calibrated approach is needed to maintain public confidence in the safety of our taxi services. At the same time, it provides some ex-offenders with a second chance."
foldable bikes and e-scooters pilot project findings,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Transport (a) what are the findings of the ongoing pilot project to allow foldable bikes and e-scooters on MRT trains and buses; (b) whether the Ministry will consider disallowing this during peak hours when the trains are very crowded; and (c) what action can be taken if a passenger fails to fold the bike or e-scooter on the trains.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The six-month trial to allow foldable bicycles and personal mobility devices to be brought onto public transport at all times of the day, started only about a month ago. We should allow the trial to run its course before making any policy decisions.So far, the public response has been positive and there have been few complaints. From our observations, the very large majority of the commuters who brought bicycles or personal mobility devices on board buses and trains behaved responsibly and courteously, and in particular, folded the devices. Those who do not do so are liable to a maximum fine of $500 upon conviction."
rank-and-file workers on adapt and grow programme,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the retention rate of rank-and-file workers who have completed the 'Adapt and Grow' programme; and (b) what is the number of rank-and-file workers who have embarked on this programme so far.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: The ""Adapt and Grow"" initiative supports workers, including rank-and-file workers, in finding jobs. The initiative includes career matching services and programmes such as Place-and-Train and Work Trials.In the first three quarters of 2016, more than 7,300 rank-and-file workers were placed by Workforce Singapore (WSG) and NTUC’s Employment and Employability Institute (NTUC-e2i) through the ""Adapt and Grow"" initiative.For rank-and-file workers placed through the Adapt and Grow career matching services in 2015 (about 10,000), seven in 10 remained in employment for at least six months after their placements.MOM, WSG and our tripartite partners will press on with efforts to support jobseekers to find and remain in employment through the ""Adapt and Grow"" initiative."
developing and maintaining a singaporean core in commercial aviation pilot sector,Mr Low Thia Khiang asked the Minister for Transport what measures are being taken to maintain and develop a Singaporean core in the commercial aviation pilot sector.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: There are currently about 3,200 commercial pilots employed by Singapore-based airlines. About nine in 10 of them are Singapore Citizens or Permanent Residents.To ensure that our airlines continue to have access to a sizeable pool of Singaporean pilots, CAAS has approved four pilot training academies in Singapore, which supplement the airlines' in-house training programmes. There are also programmes to support Singaporean pilots to up-skill themselves. Those who are keen to deepen their management or specialist skills are able to tap on various avenues of support, including CAAS' Aviation Leaders Scholarship, the SkillsFuture Study Awards and the SkillsFuture Credit scheme."

labour court orders on employee salary non-payment,Mr Kok Heng Leun asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how many complaints about salary non-payment or short-payment were lodged by employees in each year from 2015-2016; (b) how many cases were referred to the Labour Court; (c) how many Labour Court Orders were issued in favour of claimants; (d) how many Orders remained unpaid by the 14th day after their issuance; and (e) how many employers were prosecuted for non-payment or short-payment of salary in these two years respectively.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: About 6,000 salary non-payment and short payment cases were lodged by employees each year in 2015 and 20161. For each year, the breakdown of the cases were similar and broadly as follows:Among the 1,400 Labour Court orders issued in favour of employees, the payment status is as follows:The 350 defaulted orders involved 200 companies which were mostly in financial difficulties or had ceased operations. MOM took enforcement actions against all of them which included warnings, fines and restriction of work pass privileges. About 25 employers were charged in court for more egregious offences each year in 2015 and 2016. Such offences carry a maximum fine of $15,000 and/or imprisonment of up to six months per charge."
"profile and allocation of additional 30,000 healthcare workers required by 2020","Ms Tin Pei Ling asked the Minister for Health of the additional 30,000 healthcare workers required by 2020 (a) how many will be from the Singaporean core; (b) how many are expected to come through the professional conversion programme; (c) how many are expected to be retired healthcare workers; (d) how many will be allocated to the eldercare sector; (e) what will be the allocation of these workers broken down by roles; and (f) what will be the expected increase in annual manpower expenditure.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: In tandem with the expected increase in demand for healthcare services that comes with an ageing population, we projected that an additional 30,000 healthcare workers could be needed between 2015 and 2020. Over 10,000 of the additional healthcare manpower demand is projected to come from the aged care sector, while the remaining will come from the acute and primary care sectors. About 50% of the new jobs are projected to be PMET (Professionals, Managers, Executives and Technicians) positions, which include doctors, nurses, allied health professionals, and managerial and administrative staff such as centre managers, and operations and administrative executives.MOH has been and will continue to grow a strong local core to anchor our healthcare sector. Locals made up about 75% of the healthcare workforce in 2015. MOH has been making efforts on a few fronts to attract, develop and retain the local healthcare workforce.First, we have expanded intakes at local medical and nursing schools to attract more young Singaporeans to join the healthcare sector. Between 2012 and 2015, local medical and nursing intakes have increased by 29% and 17% respectively. In addition, the four allied health profession (AHP) courses in Physiotherapy, Occupational Therapy, Diagnostic Radiography and Radiation Therapy have transited from diploma courses in Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP) to four-year degree programmes at the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) in 2016, and the intake will grow over time.Apart from attracting fresh school leavers, we have put in place Healthcare Professional Conversion Programmes (PCPs) for mid-career professionals to acquire relevant training to join the healthcare sector as nurses and allied health professionals. Since the commencement of the PCPs, more than 1,000 PCP candidates have undergone healthcare training. To bring in more mid-career entrants into the community care sector, the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) has also facilitated a series of manpower recruitment initiatives for the sector, which includes organising recruitment fairs, introducing the Community Care Traineeship Programme (CCTP) to train new local support care staff for their new roles as well as the Senior Management Associate Scheme (SMAS) to train mid-career talents to take on managerial and operational positions in the sector. We will continue to provide more training pathways to enable more mid-career professionals to join the healthcare sector.Second, we are leveraging SkillsFuture (SF) initiatives to support professional development and capability building in the healthcare workforce. MOH launched the Healthcare SF Study Awards in June 2016 to encourage skills acquisition in the areas of aged care, healthcare IT and data analytics, and healthcare design, organisation and delivery. NYP is also rolling out a new Earn and Learn Programme (ELP) in gerontology nursing for nursing graduates to deepen their skills and knowledge to provide aged care in the community.Third, we seek to better retain healthcare workers. We have strengthened career pathways for clinical and support care staff across the public healthcare sector through more upgrading opportunities and better career progression, and are making efforts to increase workforce longevity in the healthcare sector. Nearly all eligible public healthcare staff were offered re-employment upon reaching age 62. The public healthcare clusters have also extended the re-employment age of public healthcare workers to age 67 since 1 July 2016, one year ahead of the statutory change. We are pursuing efforts to re-design jobs through the use of assistive equipment such as patient mobility aides and hoists, as well as encouraging healthcare institutions to offer more flexible work arrangements, to enable older staff to continue working.In parallel with efforts to increase the supply of local healthcare workers, we are stepping up productivity efforts to reduce manpower demand through improving workflows, redesigning roles and leveraging technology. Our public healthcare institutions are rolling out more self-service formats and training patients, caregivers and volunteers to support the healthcare workforce in care delivery. With productivity efforts, we will strive to keep manpower expenditure growth sustainable so as to maintain affordability of healthcare services for Singaporeans."
asean meeting update on developments in myanmar rakhine state,"Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he can provide an update on the ASEAN meeting on 19 December 2016 on recent developments in the Rakhine State, in particular (a) what was discussed at the meeting; (b) whether concerns about the treatment of the Rohingya people are valid; and (c) if valid, what will be done to encourage Myanmar to avert discrimination against the Rohingya people.","Dr Vivian Balakrishnan: On 19 December 2016, I attended the ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Retreat, which was an informal meeting called by Myanmar's State Counsellor and Minister for Foreign Affairs Daw Aung San Suu Kyi to brief ASEAN Foreign Ministers on the situation in Rakhine State. The meeting was timely and useful in helping the ASEAN Member States better understand Myanmar’s efforts to address the complex situation.There was an open, frank and constructive exchange of views among the Ministers. The Ministers also discussed how ASEAN can best support the Myanmar Government in its efforts to find a viable, long-term and sustainable solution to the problems in Rakhine State. The focus was on making sure that humanitarian aid would reach the communities in need. Following the meeting, the Myanmar Government has expressed readiness to grant necessary humanitarian access and to continue to keep ASEAN informed on developments in Rakhine State.On Singapore's end, we have emphasised that every government must ensure the safety and protection of its people regardless of race and religion, and that all people must enjoy the same basic rights. At the same time, it is also the right and the responsibility of every state to secure its borders and maintain internal security.Issues of race, language and religion in every country, including Singapore, are sensitive and complex. Similarly, inter-communal relations in Rakhine State are highly complicated with longstanding historical roots. These issues are not going to be resolved easily or quickly in the short term. Patience, restraint, and time will be required to build trust among the different stakeholders and communities, foster racial harmony, and to restore peace and stability.We continue to encourage all parties, including the Myanmar Government and international community, to continue working together towards a long-term solution so that affected communities can rebuild their lives. In Singapore, our local communities initiated a fundraising campaign in December 2016 to provide humanitarian support to affected communities in Rakhine State, as well as those affected by the earthquake in Aceh. It is heartening that Singaporeans across various communities have come forward to contribute more than $350,000. The funds raised will be divided and distributed equally to affected communities in Rakhine State and Aceh. The funds for Rakhine State will be channelled through Myanmar-based organisations to assist all affected communities, regardless of ethnicity and religion. President of the Singapore Islamic Scholars and Religious Teachers Association (PERGAS) Ustaz Mohamad Hasbi Bin Hassan had also written to the Prime Minister to offer PERGAS' assistance. In his reply, the Prime Minister encouraged PERGAS to contribute to humanitarian relief efforts through the fundraising campaign."
ministry of communications and information public opinion polls,Mr Chen Show Mao asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) how many public opinion polls did the Ministry commission in 2016; (b) what were the topics for each of these polls; (c) what was the cost of commissioning each of these polls; (d) what were the summary findings of each of these polls; and (e) whether and when will the Ministry publish the results of these polls.,"Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim: MCI conducts occasional surveys to understand public sentiment on issues, and to assess public awareness of, and response to, specific Government policies and programmes. Survey data has helped the Government evaluate if there are segments of the population who might benefit from a better understanding of a policy or programme. The data also helps the Government adjust the way it delivers services or implements policies, to better meet the needs of citizens.In 2016, we commissioned a number of surveys on a range of issues, including public perceptions of the annual Budget, public transport, changes to the elected presidency, as well as attitudes towards the death penalty in Singapore. REACH periodically releases findings that may be of interest to the public. The amount spent by the Government on surveys is in line with market rates."
convictions from total number of crime cases reported from 2010-2015,Mr Low Thia Khiang asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is the number of convictions from the total number of crime cases reported from 2010-2015; and (b) what is the number of convictions broken down by the different types of crime reported from 2010-2015.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The Police report the crime statistics annually, broken down into the different crime classes. This information is available on https://data.gov.sg/dataset/overall-crime-cases-crime-rate.Between 2010 and 2015, the conviction rate of persons charged in Court was about 97%.The Member has asked for a comparison between the number of convictions and the total number of crime cases reported. This is not likely to be meaningful for various reasons, includinga) Multiple cases attributed to the same offender.b) Not all reported cases require arrests and prosecution. For example, there are, not infrequently, unmeritorious Police reports, and other cases, which for many reasons, result in no further action.c) Even where investigations are necessary, prosecution may not be the most appropriate option. For example, over 80% of cases (running into several thousands) involving young people are not prosecuted, for reasons which have been publicly disclosed.Thus, Police do not actively track the comparison between the number of all Police reports made versus the number of convictions – which as has been stated earlier, is not a meaningful comparison."
subsidies received by chas cardholders for dental services,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Health (a) in the last year, how much subsidies for dental services has each CHAS cardholder and each CHAS cardholder aged 60 years and above received on average; (b) whether a review has been conducted to determine that the subsidies are adequate for seniors; and (c) whether the subsidies should be increased for seniors to match their needs.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: The dental subsidies under the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) vary, depending on the status of the cardholder and the dental procedure required. For example, to make a complete upper denture, CHAS Blue and Orange cardholders can receive a subsidy of up to $256.50 and $170.50 respectively. The subsidy for Pioneer Generation (PG) cardholders is $10 higher per procedure than that for CHAS Blue cardholders.Those who have made a claim received about $320 on average in dental subsidies in 2015. Those aged 60 years and above received about $370.The existing dental subsidies already cover close to 85% of the bill for the majority of visits, including for seniors. The Ministry of Health will continue to review CHAS from time to time so as to meet our objective of providing accessible and affordable dental care to Singaporeans, including our senior citizens."
collection and disbursement of zakat by muis,"Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs for 2015 (a) what is the total amount of zakat collected by MUIS; (b) what is the total amount disbursed; and (c) whether there is any undisbursed amount and, if so, how much is the undisbursed amount and what is the reason for not disbursing the monies.","Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim: In FY2015, MUIS collected $35.3million of zakat and disbursed $36.3million to the eight Asnafs, or categories, as prescribed by Muslim Law. This figure is reported yearly in MUIS’ Annual Report.Annually, more than 70% of zakat is collected during the month of Ramadhan. This is the period when MUIS would have greater clarity on the zakat funds available for disbursement in the year. However, zakat disbursement is spread throughout the year. There may be a slight surplus or deficit in any particular year. To ensure the continued funding of programmes under the zakat, MUIS maintains a reserve to buffer against shortfalls and unforeseen situations which may affect collections and needs, such as an economic downturn."
personal data collection at reach's public events,"Mr Low Thia Khiang asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) what is the rationale for collecting the NRIC number, phone number, address, and occupation of every participant at REACH's public forums; (b) how is this information used; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider doing away with this onerous registration process to encourage participation at its events.","Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim: REACH organises public forums to engage Singaporeans on various national issues. Like organisers of other conferences, REACH collects participants' NRIC numbers to verify the identity of the attendee, and facilitate the registration process. REACH also collects contact details such as phone numbers and email addresses to maintain communications with the participants before and after the forums. REACH does likewise with those who write or email in."
mendaki educational loans for post-graduate programmes,"Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (a) whether Mendaki offers educational loans for post-graduate programmes; (b) if no, what is the reason for not providing so; and (c) how many requests or appeals Mendaki has received for such educational loans in the past five years.","Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim: From 2011 to 2014, MENDAKI offered interest-free study loans to Muslim students pursuing post-graduate programmes. During this period, MENDAKI received 78 applications for such loans. However, this initiative was discontinued from 2015 to focus MENDAKI’s resources and support for Muslim students pursuing first-time degrees and diplomas."
"statistics on approved training organisations (atos), public and inhouse atos and inhouse atos","Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (a) what is the current number of approved training organisations (ATO), public and inhouse ATOs, and inhouse ATOs respectively; (b) what is the number of WSQ trainees who have completed courses offered by each of the three types of ATO in 2016; and (c) how will the SkillsFuture movement expand to employer-led and employer-owned training.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: As of end 2016, there are 419 Approved Training Organisations (ATOs) that are delivering Singapore Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ) training. Of these, 154 are in-house ATOs, 144 are public ATOs and 121 are both public and in-house ATOs.For the first three quarters of 2016, a total of about 229,000 unique local trainees completed WSQ training. The number of local trainees who completed WSQ training within each category of ATOs are as follows:Historically, Continuing Education and Training has emphasised employers training their employees. It was only much later, after the setup of Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund, that the Government also promoted individual-initiated training. Employers will continue to play an important role in training and skills development of the workforce and this has been a priority for SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG)."
taxi driver's vocational licence (tdvl) re-application criteria,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for Transport what are the conditions for re-application or re-qualification for a Taxi Driver's Vocational Licence (TDVL) where the TDVL has been revoked due to the conviction of a criminal offence that is unrelated to road traffic and/or driving matters.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Land Transport Authority (LTA) considers the nature of the offence when assessing the re-applications of ex-offenders for a Taxi Driver Vocational License (TDVL), with a view to protecting the safety of passengers. Those who have committed extremely serious offences, such as rape, murder or kidnapping, are barred from re-obtaining a TDVL for life. Those who have committed less serious offences like housebreaking are barred for three to five years from the date of conviction, after which their re-applications will be considered. Other offences which do not pose any danger to the physical safety of the public, such as forgery, would not attract any debarment.This calibrated approach is needed to maintain public confidence in the safety of our taxi services. At the same time, it provides some ex-offenders with a second chance."
foldable bikes and e-scooters pilot project findings,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Transport (a) what are the findings of the ongoing pilot project to allow foldable bikes and e-scooters on MRT trains and buses; (b) whether the Ministry will consider disallowing this during peak hours when the trains are very crowded; and (c) what action can be taken if a passenger fails to fold the bike or e-scooter on the trains.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The six-month trial to allow foldable bicycles and personal mobility devices to be brought onto public transport at all times of the day, started only about a month ago. We should allow the trial to run its course before making any policy decisions.So far, the public response has been positive and there have been few complaints. From our observations, the very large majority of the commuters who brought bicycles or personal mobility devices on board buses and trains behaved responsibly and courteously, and in particular, folded the devices. Those who do not do so are liable to a maximum fine of $500 upon conviction."
rank-and-file workers on adapt and grow programme,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the retention rate of rank-and-file workers who have completed the 'Adapt and Grow' programme; and (b) what is the number of rank-and-file workers who have embarked on this programme so far.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: The ""Adapt and Grow"" initiative supports workers, including rank-and-file workers, in finding jobs. The initiative includes career matching services and programmes such as Place-and-Train and Work Trials.In the first three quarters of 2016, more than 7,300 rank-and-file workers were placed by Workforce Singapore (WSG) and NTUC’s Employment and Employability Institute (NTUC-e2i) through the ""Adapt and Grow"" initiative.For rank-and-file workers placed through the Adapt and Grow career matching services in 2015 (about 10,000), seven in 10 remained in employment for at least six months after their placements.MOM, WSG and our tripartite partners will press on with efforts to support jobseekers to find and remain in employment through the ""Adapt and Grow"" initiative."
developing and maintaining a singaporean core in commercial aviation pilot sector,Mr Low Thia Khiang asked the Minister for Transport what measures are being taken to maintain and develop a Singaporean core in the commercial aviation pilot sector.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: There are currently about 3,200 commercial pilots employed by Singapore-based airlines. About nine in 10 of them are Singapore Citizens or Permanent Residents.To ensure that our airlines continue to have access to a sizeable pool of Singaporean pilots, CAAS has approved four pilot training academies in Singapore, which supplement the airlines' in-house training programmes. There are also programmes to support Singaporean pilots to up-skill themselves. Those who are keen to deepen their management or specialist skills are able to tap on various avenues of support, including CAAS' Aviation Leaders Scholarship, the SkillsFuture Study Awards and the SkillsFuture Credit scheme."
update on cross island mrt line environmental impact assessment (eia),Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the Ministry can provide an update on site investigation works on the two alignment options as part of Phase 2 of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for the Cross Island MRT Line; and (b) how is the Ministry engaging volunteers from the nature community to monitor and manage the impact on the ground as the rainy season increases the risk of spills into forest streams caused by boring works.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Site investigation works on the two alignment options have commenced, and are expected to complete by end-2018. We consult with the nature groups regularly. LTA has also appointed one of the nature group representatives as an advisor to monitor and audit the implementation of the Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan developed in Phase 1."
review of traffic flow at junction outside trade association hub,"Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng asked the Minister for Transport that in view of the completion of the Trade Association Hub at Jurong Town Hall in 2017 and the subsequent increase in trade association activities and programmes at the Hub, whether the Ministry can review and redesign the traffic flow around the area, particularly the traffic junction outside the Trade Association Hub so as to facilitate entry and exit out of the Hub.",Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Jurong Town Hall Road and Jurong East Street 11 have already been widened in 2012 and 2014 respectively in anticipation of the Trade Association Hub opening. The junction outside the Trade Association Hub has also been designed to allow vehicles to enter and exit the Trade Association Hub without interrupting traffic flow on Jurong Town Hall Road.Public transport is another option as the Trade Association Hub is conveniently located within a 10-minute walk from Jurong East MRT Station.
considerations for lrt service bi-directional operations,Ms Sun Xueling asked the Minister for Transport what are the parameters to determine when a LRT service can operate bi-directionally as the LRT service in the west loop of the Punggol LRT service travels in one direction before 3pm and in the other direction after 3pm.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The Punggol West Loop LRT service is currently operating unidirectionally as its ridership of 7,000 passengers a day is still low. The Punggol East Loop, for example, has a ridership of 45,000. When ridership grows requiring additional capacity, we will increase the service frequency and/or operate it bi-directionally."
update on construction of lifts at pedestrian overhead bridges,Mr Ang Wei Neng asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether he can provide an update on the construction of lifts at pedestrian overhead bridges; and (b) whether LTA can consider expediting the construction of lifts at the pedestrian overhead bridge that links to the Chinese Garden MRT station.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Lifts have been installed at 18 of the 47 pedestrian overhead bridges identified for the lift retrofitting programme. Preliminary works at the overhead bridge at Chinese Garden MRT station have begun, and the lift installation should be completed by the end of the year."
inclusion of potong pasir in silver zone programme,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for Transport whether LTA will consider including the Potong Pasir area (in addition to Lorong 8 Toa Payoh) in the Silver Zone programme as it is a mature estate with a high number of elderly residents.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: In the implementation of the Silver Zone programme, Land Transport Authority (LTA) has prioritised areas where there is a relatively higher number of traffic accidents involving the elderly. We will include the Potong Pasir area in the programme."
"update on sg50's '50 schools, 50 smes' initiative","Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (a) whether the ""50 schools, 50 SMEs"" initiative of SG50 has been completed; (b) whether the Ministry has achieved its target of pairing 50 schools with 50 different SMEs; and (c) whether the Ministry has evaluated each school-SME partnership to find out if the learning outcomes have been met.","Mr S Iswaran: The ""50 Schools, 50 SMEs"" was a joint initiative by SPRING Singapore and the National Library Board (NLB) carried out from April 2014 to May 2015 in conjunction with the SG50 celebrations. The programme aimed to connect the younger generation with companies which had made contributions to Singapore. Students were given the opportunity to understand Singapore businesses up close and appreciate how local businesses had persevered through difficult times and contributed to Singapore’s economic development.The programme matched 250 Secondary school students (comprising 62 teams) from 51 schools with 62 SMEs, exceeding its target of pairing 50 schools with 50 SMEs. Students were matched with companies from a broad range of industries and after the attachment were required to submit a write-up on the company based on their learning experiences. Some of the featured companies which participated in this programme included Eu Yan Sang, Muthu's Curry, Malayan Daching, Epigram Books, Gardenasia and Pet Lovers Centre.The feedback received from the programme was positive. Students found the experience beneficial and were able to appreciate how businesses had to adapt and innovate to remain competitive. Some students were motivated to consider working for an SME or setting up their own business. Many also shared that the experience helped them appreciate the important role SMEs played within the economy. The companies which participated also felt that they had benefited from the energy and fresh ideas the students brought with them. The write-ups from the completed projects have been uploaded onto the Singapore Memory Project portal, Wikipedia and Infopedia."
factors determining number and capacity of senior activity and care centres in hdb towns,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) how is the number and capacity of senior activity and care centres determined in existing HDB towns; (b) whether the current planning parameters are sufficient; and (c) how many senior activity centres are there in the Bedok South area.,"Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: MSF and MOH have been working closely together to meet the full spectrum of social and healthcare needs of our seniors so they can age gracefully within the community.MSF sets up Senior Activity Centres (SACs) to reach out to low-income and vulnerable seniors staying in HDB rental flats. SACs conduct activities such as outreach, home visits and centre-based activities, to encourage seniors to form social support networks and help detect risks early. An SAC is usually established when there is a reasonable number of seniors in the rental blocks. Larger centres are built in locations with more seniors within a cluster of rental blocks. MSF regularly reviews the planning and development of SACs, taking into account factors such as the projected elderly population in upcoming rental blocks, the SAC utilisation patterns and users' feedback. There is currently a total of five SACs in Bedok planning area, including one in Bedok South subzone.MOH develops Senior Care Centres (SCCs) to provide day care and rehabilitation services to seniors with care needs. MOH plans for these centres, taking into account projected demand based on a combination of factors such as demographics and incidence of disability. MOH conducts regular reviews of projections and adjusts development plans, based on updated information, to ensure that our seniors’ care needs are adequately met. Within Bedok planning area, there are five centres that can serve about 300 seniors every day. In 2017, the new Chai Chee nursing home will also have a new day centre that can serve an additional 100 seniors.SACs and SCCs complement each other to meet the social and healthcare needs of our seniors in the community. MSF and MOH will continue to work together to ensure that seniors are able to access the support and care services they require."
"raising income cap of $1,500 for public rental housing","Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry will consider raising the current income cap of $1,500 for public rental housing in view of the rising cost of living and the higher income caps of Government subsidies such as the child care/infant care subsidy and ComCare Short-to-Medium Term Assistance.","Mr Lawrence Wong: The income ceilings set for various Government subsidies serve different purposes, and differ based on the nature of help provided and the target population. HDB reviews the income ceiling and other eligibility criteria for HDB rental flats from time to time. This enables us to prioritise the rental flat supply to benefit low-income families who are without family support and other housing options.In practice, HDB has exercised flexibility to enable some families with higher income get a public rental flat, if their circumstances are deserving of such assistance."
number of hdb blocks qualified for home improvement programme,Mr Ang Wei Neng asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the total number of HDB blocks that qualify for the Home Improvement Program (HIP); (b) how many blocks have been selected for HIP by December 2016; and (c) whether HDB can consider announcing the precincts selected for HIP in 2017 and 2018 by the first quarter of 2017.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The Home Improvement Programme (HIP) was introduced in 2007 with about 3,000 eligible blocks. Blocks built up to 1986 and have not undergone the Main Upgrading Programme are eligible for the HIP.To date, HIP has been announced for more than 2,000 blocks.The next nomination exercise to select blocks to undergo HIP is scheduled to take place in early FY2017. Like the last exercise for 2015 and 2016, we are planning to select the HIP projects for 2017 and 2018 at one go, so that residents who may have plans to renovate their flats can make a better-informed decision."
dedicated rest areas set aside for outsourced workers in government buildings,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for National Development (a) how many Government buildings have set aside dedicated rest areas for outsourced workers; and (b) and how many of these are inspected regularly to ensure that they are not allocated for other purposes.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: There are 115 Government-owned buildings with at least 3,000 square metres net floor area of commercial space. This is a reasonable threshold for which rest areas for outsourced workers could be provided as part of the building infrastructure.Out of these 115 buildings, the vast majority – 96 buildings – have dedicated rest areas for outsourced workers. These buildings are also inspected to ensure that the rest areas are not allocated for other purposes. While there are no dedicated rest areas in the other buildings, the workers there are allowed to use shared spaces (eg, visitors' rest areas and pantries) to rest."
measures to prevent lingering in changi airport's departure lounge,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Home Affairs with regard to the recent case of a man who stayed in Changi Airport's departure lounge for 18 days (a) how did the overstayer escape detection for so long; and (b) whether there are measures in place to ensure that this will not recur.,"Mr K Shanmugam: On 21 August 2016, a Malaysian, Raejali Buntut, entered the airport transit areas after clearing departure immigration. He checked into Plaza Premium Lounge in Terminal 1 using a valid boarding pass and a Priority Pass card, which allows the card holder access to various airport lounges at Changi Airport. He was due to depart for Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia at 7.05am on the same day.Raejali overslept in the lounge and missed his flight. Instead of informing the airline, which would have assisted to book him onto another flight, he remained in the airport transit areas for 18 days. He visited various transit lounges using his Priority Pass and forged electronic boarding passes.On 7 September 2016, Raejali re-entered the Dnata transit lounge at Terminal 1. Dnata lounge staff became suspicious after seeing his visits to the lounge and alerted the police. He was then arrested.Police investigations revealed that Raejali had come to Singapore for job interviews. After missing his return flight to Kuala Lumpur, he decided to stay on in the transit lounges as he waited for the result of his job interviews. Raejali was charged in court for forging boarding passes to cheat the airport lounges and was sentenced to two weeks imprisonment.This year, about 4.85 million passengers passed through the transit areas every month (more than 160,000 passengers per day) in Changi Airport. Our security agencies conduct regular patrols and checks on persons, and identify those who do not have a valid reason to remain within the transit areas. Every day, on an average, about eight passengers are escorted out of the transit areas because they do not have a valid reason to be in the transit areas. These include passengers who arrived in Singapore at the early hours of the morning and choose to stay in the transit areas until public transportation is available; or passengers who have missed their flight.The Airport Police also partner with the airport community to keep a lookout on the ground, and exercise vigilance against suspicious behaviour or objects which may pose a threat to our Airport. The airport community including staff working at the transit lounges are trained by our security agencies to detect and report suspicious people and articles so that further checks can be conducted.The Airport Police have engaged the transit lounge operators, advising them to be vigilant against possible abuses of boarding passes and to promptly report any suspicious cases. The Airport Police are also working with the transit lounge operators to review the process of screening travellers entering the transit lounges.The Airport Police are also liaising with airlines. Airlines need to assist by alerting when passengers do not turn up for a flight.In this case, it was the vigilance of four airport staff that had led to the detection and arrest of Raejali. Police have also recognised them by commending them with the Public Spiritedness Award on 20 September 2016."
hiring of ex-offenders in financial services sector,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Prime Minister (a) whether any MAS rules prevent the hiring of any category of ex-offenders for positions in the financial services sector; (b) in how many instances has MAS found any financial institution to be in breach of the ""fit and proper"" guidelines in their recruitment process over the last ten years; (c) what have been the types of breaches deemed to have occurred in such cases; and (d) whether MAS is alerted if an individual's job application is rejected by a financial institution due to his/her being an ex-offender.","Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): A critical success factor for the financial industry is the trust that depositors, investors and policyholders place in financial institutions (""FIs""). Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) expects employees and representatives of FIs to be fit and proper in order to safeguard the interests of consumers as well as to uphold Singapore’s reputation as a trusted financial centre.MAS has no rules against the hiring of ex-offenders for positions in the financial industry. MAS has issued guidelines on its expectations and criteria for what it means to be fit and proper. To-date, MAS has not found any FIs to be in breach of the due diligence requirements set out in these guidelines.FIs are responsible for their own hiring decisions and ensuring that the persons they employ are fit and proper. They perform their own due diligence on potential candidates and do not have to inform MAS of candidates that they have hired or rejected. There are two exceptions to this rule. For key positions in FIs such as CEOs, board directors and selected senior management roles, FIs are required to seek MAS’ approval for their appointments after assessing them to be fit and proper. Secondly, FIs are also required to notify MAS before appointing representatives to conduct financial advisory and capital markets activities.For such positions, MAS does not automatically reject an FI’s application just because the candidate is an ex-offender. MAS’ guidelines also make clear that a candidate who fails to meet any particular criterion is not automatically deemed as being not fit and proper. MAS adopts a proportionate approach which takes into consideration the nature and responsibilities of a person in determining the relative emphasis and standard expected of that person. In the case of ex-offenders, MAS would also have regard to the seriousness and circumstances of the offence, the time that has elapsed since their conviction, and the duties and responsibilities to be assumed.Like other financial regulators, MAS has the power to issue prohibition orders (""POs"") to prevent persons with serious criminal convictions, such as dishonesty, fraud, and criminal breach of trust, from working in the financial advisory, insurance and capital markets industry for a specified period of time. Such actions serve as deterrent, and help to uphold high standards of honesty and integrity in the financial sector. Individuals who have been issued POs may still be considered for positions in the financial industry after the expiry of their POs."
benefits from productivity and innovation credit and capability development grant,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (a) how many workers have benefited from the Productivity and Innovation Credit (PIC) and Capability Development Grant (CDG) over the last three years; and (b) how can the Ministry work towards having productivity gains from public schemes such as the PIC and CDG be shared equitably with workers.,"Mr S Iswaran: The Productivity and Innovation Credit (PIC) and Capability Development Grant (CDG) are aimed at helping Singapore enterprises and workers achieve productivity improvements and build business capabilities. Over the last three years, an average of 80,000 enterprises, employing more than 2.5 million workers, benefitted from the PIC scheme annually. Over the same period, an annual average of 700 enterprises, employing more than 150,000 workers, tapped the CDG.Government, industry and the unions have been working together to enable both companies and workers to benefit from productivity improvements. For example, NTUC has partnered with various companies on measures that raise their productivity and competitiveness. The resultant productivity gains are then shared with workers in these companies, such as through allowances or payments. As a specific example, the Inclusive Growth Programme (IGP) administered by e2i co-funds companies to embark on productivity improvement projects. The companies in turn are required to share their productivity gains with their workers through higher wages."
balloting of national day parade tickets,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Defence (a) how many National Day Parade (NDP) tickets are up for balloting each year; (b) whether the Ministry will consider disallowing those who successfully balloted in one year from balloting the following year; and (c) whether there is any other measure explored so that more Singaporeans can watch NDP live at least once in their lifetime.,"Dr Ng Eng Hen: The total number of tickets put up each year for balloting by the public to attend the previews and the NDP show range from 50,000 to 165,000. The Padang and Marina Bay sites for NDP have lower seating capacity while the new National Stadium has the largest capacity, especially since an additional preview show has been added to increase the pool of balloted tickets. The two NE Shows also provide opportunities to tens of thousands of school children to watch the NDP live as part of their national education. In addition, a small proportion of tickets are set aside to be given to sponsors, grassroots organisations, and families of participants and Ministries in recognition of their support and hard work and effort in organising the NDP.Since 2013, Mindef has already excluded applicants who were successful in the preceding year from the current year’s eBalloting. This should improve the chance of success for ballots by those who have never seen the NDP live. Mindef is gratified with the strong interest shown by Singaporeans to celebrate the NDP shows but the overall success of ballots would still be dependent on the total number of applicants which can be many times the number of balloted tickets each year. Live telecasts of the NDP will continue to ensure that as many Singaporeans as possible get to watch the NDP show and celebrate National Day together."
statistics on renunciation of singapore citizenship,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Prime Minister (a) from 2005 to 2015, how many Singaporeans renounced their citizenship each year; (b) what is the breakdown of the top five reasons for citizens wanting to emigrate each year as revealed through the mandatory questionnaire; (c) what is the breakdown of the top three reasons for the renunciation of Singapore citizenship each year, as revealed through the mandatory questionnaire; (d) whether the Government has done a thorough study to understand the reasons for renunciation of citizenship; and (e) what is being done to prevent such numbers from increasing.","Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): An average of 1,200 Singaporeans renounced their Singapore Citizenship (SC) each year from 2005 to 2015. The annual SC renunciation rate remains low at under 0.1%.Singaporeans renouncing their citizenship will be asked to indicate their reasons in a non-mandatory questionnaire. The most frequent reasons given include (a) family-related reasons - such as marriage to a foreigner or to join their family members overseas, (b) preference for a different lifestyle or environment, or (c) career or business-related reasons.Our focus is to ensure that Singapore continues to be the best home for all Singaporeans. We will continue to develop an attractive living environment and a thriving economy which creates good jobs and opportunities for Singaporeans. We also want to strengthen Singaporeans’ bonds with each other, and build a strong sense of identity and belonging to the nation.We actively engage our Singaporeans who are studying or working overseas. Through efforts such as the Overseas Singaporean Unit’s programmes and initiatives, Singapore Day in selected cities overseas being one example, we seek to ensure that our overseas Singaporeans maintain a strong identity and remain connected and committed to Singapore’s future even while they are overseas."
cyclists of electric/motorised bicycles or vehicles' liability for victim's medical fees,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry will consider amending the law to make it mandatory for cyclists of electric/motorised bicycles or vehicles who are found guilty in accidents with pedestrians to pay compensation for the victim's medical fees.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The law already provides for those injured by bicycles, power-assisted bicycles or vehicles to seek compensation through private settlement or civil court action. For cases where the offender is prosecuted and convicted in criminal court, the courts will consider if compensation to the victim should be paid based on the circumstances of each case."
"government assistance to help micro, small and medium businesses venture overseas","Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Trade) (a) what has been the performance of Singapore's trade in services compared to trade in goods, especially in the context of the weak performance of the latter; and (b) how can the Government further help SMEs to export their services.","4 Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Trade) how can the Government better help the micro and small SMEs to venture overseas to tap a bigger market so that they can continue to grow.Mr Lim Hng Kiang: Growth in Singapore’s services trade has outpaced that of goods in recent years. Between 2010 and 2015, services exports grew by a robust compound annual growth rate of 6.9 percent, compared to a 0.1 percent decline in goods exports. While services exports growth has moderated since 2015, this was in line with the weakening global trade environment, and largely attributable to the slowdown in segments supporting goods trade, such as freight services. Growth remained resilient in segments such as insurance services, and telecommunications, computer and information services, which continue to see regional demand.Singapore has a broad network of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) and regional initiatives that help companies tap into external demand for our goods and services. For example, the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) allows our services exporters greater market access to the ASEAN region with restrictions lowered in more than 80 services sectors. The AEC’s continuing efforts to facilitate, protect and liberalise cross-border investments enable our companies to venture into the region at lower costs and with greater assurance.Singapore also has a suite of assistance schemes that help SMEs internationalise and trade with overseas markets. This includes the Market Readiness Assistance (MRA) and the Global Company Partnership (GCP) schemes administered by IE Singapore. The MRA provides broad-based assistance to companies that are starting to internationalise, while the GCP provides targeted assistance to companies with a more established overseas presence. The GCP covers capability and manpower development, market access and financing. Over 80 percent of the beneficiaries of these assistance measures are SMEs.The Government is also collaborating with Trade Associations and Chambers to help SMEs prepare themselves for overseas opportunities. The IE-SCCCI Singapore Enterprise Centre (ISSEC) in Shanghai which is a joint initiative between IE Singapore and the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce & Industry is an example of such collaboration. Over the past three years, ISSEC has served more than 5,000 companies through outreach and advisory assistance, and provided research on emerging market opportunities in China. The companies assisted by ISSEC are predominantly SMEs and micro enterprises. ISSEC will be going beyond Shanghai to help such firms build up market expertise and capabilities in other parts of China.IE Singapore also has an extensive network of Overseas Centres internationally that provides targeted assistance for companies in both developed and emerging markets. These include helping them generate new business leads in Southeast Asian markets such as Indonesia and Myanmar, gaining entry as first movers in emerging markets such as Africa and Latin America, and identifying opportunities to enhance technology capabilities in developed markets such as the UK and US.Companies need the right talent to embark on internationalisation plans - people who have global mindsets, exposure to international business environments, in-depth understanding of industries, and ability to navigate markets. To build a pipeline of global-ready Singaporeans for international roles, manpower development programmes are also in place. For example, IE Singapore's Young Talent Programme exposes students from universities, polytechnics and ITEs to internship opportunities in overseas markets, and equips them with foundational skills needed for international careers. Skillsfuture Study Awards for International Business are also given out to prepare professionals, managers and executives for international roles through various courses, market attachments and customised overseas immersion programmes."
government assistance to small and micro businesses on staff hire,"Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng asked the Minister for Manpower how can the Government better help SMEs, particularly the small and micro SMEs, to hire the staff they need as they attempt to transform and upgrade their businesses.","Mr Lim Swee Say: Taking a Whole-of-Government approach to help SMEs transform and upgrade, government agencies including SPRING, WSG, IMDA, BCA, STB and EDB, together with e2i, offer one-stop service under the Lean Enterprise Development Scheme (LEDS). The main scope of support covers development of new capability, new capacity and new markets. It also helps SMEs to meet their manpower needs by becoming more manpower lean and improving human resource practices. SMEs on the LEDS may also receive transitional manpower support to keep existing processes running while they transit to new, manpower-lean methods of production or service.SMEs, particularly the micro and small SMEs, can also receive help from WSG to recruit PMETs through programmes such as P-Max and Career Support Programme. e2i has also developed Place-and-Train programmes for various sectors to help SMEs hire, train, and retain workers. To attract younger talent, SMEs can tap on the SkillsFuture Earn and Learn Programme to recruit local graduates from the polytechnics and Institute of Technical Education. SPRING's SME Talent Programme (STP) further supports SMEs' talent attraction efforts through quality internships.In addition, WSG helps companies, including SMEs, in their recruitment through career fairs.As our economy makes the transition to become more manpower lean, we encourage SMEs to make full use of the support offered by LEDS and various agencies. They may approach any of the 12 SME Centres for assistance."
recourse for employers of errant foreign domestic workers,Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for Manpower what recourse does an employer of a foreign domestic worker have where the worker has abandoned her work agreement and owes sums to her employer.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: Personal loans are usually extended by an employer to the foreign domestic worker (FDW) to help the FDW pay placement fees to the local Employment Agency (EA). Our EA Licence Conditions require EAs to state their refund policies in their contracts with employers, including refunds for loans given by employers for the placement fee. Therefore, if the FDW terminates her employment prematurely, employers should check the contract they signed with their EA. The contract will lay out whether and under what circumstances they can get a full or partial refund.There are also EAs who do not require employers to extend personal loans to the FDWs; so the issue of a refund does not even arise. Employers who prefer such an arrangement can approach these EAs."
measures to limit noise caused by mrt trains to central grove condominium residents,Ms Tin Pei Ling asked the Minister for Transport what will be done to improve the quality of life of residents in Central Grove condominium who have been adversely affected by the loud and consistent noise of passing trains on the MRT track that is adjacent to the condominium.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The noise level as measured at Central Grove Condominium is lower than NEA’s noise threshold of 67 decibels averaged over an hour. We will continue to monitor the situation, while also implementing system-wide measures to mitigate railway noise. These include fitting trains with noise-dampening wheels, using ballast and concrete sleepers on elevated tracks which absorb vibrations from trains better, and servicing train wheels and tracks even more frequently."
causes for dislodged platform door at sixth avenue downtown line station,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Transport whether he can provide an update on the causes for the dislodged platform door at Sixth Avenue Downtown Line Station on 4 October 2016 and whether any related issues affecting safety have been resolved.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: LTA and SBS Transit issued a joint press release on 18 October 2016 on this incident. Investigations found that a bolt on the fastener, which secures the platform screen door to the guide rail, had loosened and caused the door to be misaligned. The door was dislodged after coming into contact with the side of a train. No commuters were hurt. The contractors are enhancing the fasteners throughout the Downtown Line to prevent a recurrence."
coordinated and holistic help for smes to transform,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) how can Government agencies be more coordinated and holistic when helping our SMEs to transform in an environment where many SMEs may have immediate concerns of survival.,"Mr S Iswaran: Singapore is facing a period of slow growth. Some sectors have been more adversely affected, such as wholesale trade and marine & offshore engineering. We are also seeing weakness in industries like food services and real estate, though there remain bright spots such as in the information & communications, education and health & social services sectors.Against this backdrop, the Government is committed to supporting our SMEs in their growth and restructuring efforts. Our agencies have been working closely with industry partners such as our Trade Associations and Chambers (TACs), Centres of Innovation (COIs), SME Centres and financial institutions to reach out to and provide assistance to our SMEs. Our agencies have coordinated their efforts to address needs at the industry and firm level.At the industry level, we have embarked on a $4.5 billion Industry Transformation Programme where Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) are being developed for more than 20 key industries. This involves a coordinated Whole-of-Government effort, in partnership with key industry partners and multipliers. Each ITM will be tailored to the needs of the industry. In developing the ITMs, the Government will examine the industry landscape, the future trends and needs to set out a suite of initiatives to systematically raise productivity, develop skills, drive innovation, and promote internationalisation, so as to catalyse transformation and achieve the stated vision of each industry. The ITMs are focused on providing more integrated assistance for companies across domains to ensure our industries can stay competitive in the medium term, and our workers get to secure and retain good jobs.At the firm level, our agencies work closely together on initiatives to better support our SMEs to address their immediate needs such as in financing, as well as capability development and internationalization to position them for growth. In Budget 2016, we launched the SME Working Capital Loan (WCL) to help local enterprises access unsecured working capital financing during this period of slower economic growth. Under the WCL, enterprises can access a loan quantum of up to $300,000 for their daily operations. There has been a strong take-up for the WCL, and over $400 million in loans have been given to SMEs to-date.The 12 SME Centres provide first-stop assistance through one-to-one advice and guidance to SMEs, spanning immediate needs as well as business plans for the medium term. From this year onwards (2016), the SME Centres will focus on enhancing business capabilities and driving the adoption of solutions, to ensure that the assistance provided translates to tangible business outcomes for the SMEs. Through the SME Centres, SMEs have access to support schemes across government agencies. This includes support for capability development and internationalisation. To help more companies with capability development, SPRING introduced a simplified Capability Development Grant (CDG) application process for grants below $30,000 in 2015 to encourage more companies to take the first step to upgrade their capabilities in areas such as productivity, financial management and human capital development. The response to this move has been positive. As at October 2016, more than 2,000 CDG projects have been approved.Our TACs also play an important role as partners in providing assistance to SMEs. For example, through the TAC-led Collaborative Industry Projects (CIPs), TACs will identify and drive the adoption of solutions to address common industry-specific needs. Since the launch of the programme in 2016, five TACs have embarked on projects which are expected to benefit 600 SMEs.More recently, we have taken steps to make our grants more accessible through the Business Grant Portal (BGP). This is an online application platform for businesses to apply for grants across different Government agencies. Through the BGP, businesses can easily find the relevant grants to support their business needs, without the need to approach multiple agencies. The beta version of the BGP was launched on 3 May 2016 with IE Singapore’s Market Readiness Assistance (MRA) grant and subsequently BCA's Building Information Modelling (BIM) grant, and over 900 applications have been received thus far. The BGP will be launched soon, and businesses can expect more grants to be introduced onto the BGP progressively.As we navigate the challenges ahead, the Government will need to work collectively with our companies, workers, unions and industry associations for successful economic transformation. It is critical that SMEs stand ready to embrace new technologies and business models, and on its part the Government will remain firmly committed in supporting our companies through this phase."
support for small and medium-sized kindergartens and childcare operators,Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) how many small and medium-sized kindergartens and childcare operators have ceased operations since 2015; and (b) how does the Ministry support small and medium-sized operators to remain viable.,"Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: Fewer than 30 pre-schools, constituting about 2% of the 1,700 pre-schools in Singapore, ceased operations in 2015. While some of these were standalone pre-schools, there were also those part of a larger group.The Government’s priority is to provide good quality, accessible and affordable early childhood services, so as to ensure a good start for every child. To achieve this, the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) has implemented a range of initiatives to support operators of different sizes.First, we have the Anchor Operator and Partner Operator schemes to support selected larger and smaller pre-school operators respectively. Besides keeping their fees to the specified caps, these operators are also supported to improve the quality of their pre-schools. We have also seen smaller operators coming together to achieve greater economies of scale and tap on government support under the Partner Operator Scheme.Second, we have a number of broad-based initiatives to help all operators develop and attract more educators to the sector. These include the new Skills Framework for Early Childhood Care and Education, the Professional Development Programme, and ECDA's Scholarships and Training Awards. In addition, the Government also provides funding support for operators to adopt smart solutions, such as for attendance-taking and temperature-taking, to support educators in their work and to raise sector productivity.Third, support schemes are available to help operators defray costs and keep their fees affordable. These include the Community and Sports Facilities Scheme under the Urban Redevelopment Authority, as well as the Portable Rental Subsidies and the Workplace Child Care Centre Scheme under ECDA. Operators can receive centre development grants, furnishing and equipment grants, or rental cost subsidies if they meet affordability and quality requirements.Finally, small and medium-sized operators can also tap on the Capability Development Grant, Innovation and Capability Voucher and other programmes offered by SPRING Singapore. Operators can make use of these schemes to build capabilities via staff training, technology adoption or by defraying the cost of consultancy projects in the areas of human resources, financial management, innovation and productivity."
special audits by auditor-general on government-related bodies,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Finance (a) in the past 20 years, how many Government-related bodies have undergone a special audit by the Auditor-General outside of the regular annual audit exercises by the Auditor-General; and (b) what are the details and rationale of each case.","Mr Heng Swee Keat: The Auditor-General’s Office (AGO) annually conducts audits of the Government Financial Statements which covers the accounts of the Ministries, Departments and Organs of State. In addition, it also carries out selective audits on a selection of public agencies which involves checks on their compliance with rules and procedures.Besides these audits, AGO had carried out two special audits over the past 20 years(a) ""Healthcare Subsidy Audit"" in 1996Following a Parliamentary resolution to verify the fees charged and health care subsidy provided by Government polyclinics and public hospitals, including a claim made in Parliament that ""health care costs are hardly subsidised at all"", the Select Committee on Verification of Health Care Subsidy of Government Polyclinics and Public Hospitals was formed and AGO was requested to carry out an audit to verify the Government's health care figures (such as fees charged, subsidy level provided). Government's health care figures were independently verified by AGO and confirmed to be free from material errors, and the details of AGO's findings were tabled and debated in Parliament on 30th September 1996 and 10th October 1996 respectively.(b) ""Audit of Aljunied-Hougang-Punggol East Town Council (AHPETC)"" in 2014AGO was directed to carry out an audit of AHPETC’s FY2012 accounts following repeated and serious concerns raised by AHPETC’s auditors. AHPETC’s auditor submitted a disclaimer of opinion on AHPETC's Financial Statements for FY2011 and FY2012. The auditor also issued a qualified opinion on AHPETC's other legal and regulatory requirements, stating that AHPETC has not complied with the provisions of the Town Councils Act and Financial Rules in various respects. AGO submitted its report on 6th February 2015, and the details of its findings were debated in Parliament on 12th and 13th February 2015."
planning process for installation of mobile phone base stations,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry will review the planning process for the installation of mobile phone base stations to enable such stations to be built during a building's construction stage and make mobile coverage a mandatory compliance for that building's Temporary Occupation Permit.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Adequate mobile coverage should be provided to new buildings in a timely manner. Currently, Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) install mobile base stations on the rooftops of selected new HDB blocks to ensure that the area will have good mobile coverage when the residents move in. However, there could be operational delays, such as construction delays to blocks selected for base station installation.HDB has been working with all stakeholders, including Town Councils, IDA and MNOs, to study how to expedite the installation of such base stations. For example, HDB and IDA are looking into the possibility of expediting approval procedures between MNOs and Town Councils. HDB and IDA are also exploring the possibility of incorporating MNOs’ infrastructure and engineering requirements during the pre-tender planning phase of new HDB developments, so that the subsequent physical base station installation works could be accelerated.Finally, MCI and IDA are considering amendments to the Telecommunications Act to facilitate the use of rooftop space of one building to provide mobile coverage in another building. If implemented, it will be easier for MNOs to deploy their equipment on the rooftops of adjacent buildings to improve mobile coverage of a particular area.Given these ongoing efforts, there may not be a need to mandate mobile coverage as a TOP condition for each new building. Ultimately, it is more important to ensure close and effective co-operation among all the relevant stakeholders, which go beyond the developer of the building project."
actions against persons for attempted suicides in 2015,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Home Affairs of the 837 persons taken into custody for attempted suicide in 2015 (a) what have been the specific measures used to arrest them; (b) how many have been placed in lock-up and for how long on average; (c) whether any investigations have been conducted to look into the actual impact of these measures on their well-being; and (d) how many of these persons have been referred to Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) and Institute of Mental Health (IMH) respectively.,"Mr K Shanmugam: Police officers are trained to respond to cases of attempted suicide with sensitivity and compassion. Persons who attempt suicide are emotionally and psychologically distressed. When responding to such cases, Police’s priority is to ensure the person’s safety. Police officers will look out for signs of suicidal tendencies, and what actions to take. Police usually arrest persons for attempting suicide in order to prevent them from doing harm, either to themselves or to others. In these cases, the Police officers will make an assessment and apply handcuffs when there is a need to ensure the safety of the person, the escorting officers or members of public in the vicinity; or to prevent the person from absconding.For persons taken into custody, depending on their condition, they may be taken to the Police station for investigation, sent to the hospitals directly for medical treatment, referred to the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) for psychiatric treatment, or to the Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) for counselling. Police do not maintain data on the number of persons referred to the IMH, or to the SOS. However, only two out of 1096 cases of attempted suicide reported in 2015 were eventually prosecuted. The purpose of arrest is primarily to ensure that the person receives the appropriate help, and not to bring charges. For persons who are brought back to the Police station, Police will not detain them longer than is necessary to investigate the case and to process the necessary referrals. The actual duration of detention depends on the circumstances of each case."
response to ransom threats on internet,Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether payment of ransom is legal and how corporations and consumers should respond to ransom threats on the Internet.,"Mr K Shanmugam: In some situations, payment of ransom, for kidnapping, could be an offence under the Kidnapping Act. Beyond that, payment of ransom, for example, to be free from some other threat, is generally not an offence.There is a trend on the internet, termed as ""ransomware"", where a cybercriminal locks the victim’s files, computer system or mobile device and restricts its access, until a ransom is paid.While it is generally not an offence to pay ransom to a cybercriminal who deploys ransomware on the victim’s computer or device, victims are nevertheless advised not to pay the perpetrator. There is no guarantee that their files can be recovered even if they have paid a ransom. There have been instances where users were unable to access their files again. Instead, victims of ransomware should lodge a Police report as soon as possible.Prevention is key to avoid falling prey to ransomware and other cybercrime. Individuals should be careful when dealing with emails from unfamiliar sources or when interacting with strangers on the internet, and not to download suspicious files or open attachments in emails from these unfamiliar senders. The public and corporations should also protect their computers or devices with firewalls, spam filters and up-to-date anti-virus softwares. They should also backup their data regularly."
mental health declaration for job applications,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Manpower what is the Government's position on employers requiring prospective employees to declare if they have a history of mental illness and whether the Government should lead by example by removing such declarations from public service employment application forms for non-sensitive positions.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: The Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices emphasises the importance of recruiting and selecting employees on the basis of merit regardless of age, race, gender, religion, disability or family status. Job application forms should only ask for information that is relevant to assessing an applicant’s suitability for the job.The Government requires candidates to fill in a short application form that assesses their suitability for the job. Declaration of any existing medical conditions, including mental illness, does not disqualify a candidate from being considered for a position in the Public Service. Public agencies will select the candidate with the best overall fit for the job, taking into account his skills and qualifications, relevant work experience and personal attributes."
rehabilitation programmes for different risk profiles under enhanced drug rehabilitation regime,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Home Affairs what are the differences in rehabilitation programmes for the different risk profiles in the enhanced Drug Rehabilitation Regime implemented in 2014 and how is the effectiveness of the outcome of the rehabilitation regime for the respective risk profiles measured.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The Singapore Prison Service (SPS) introduced the enhanced Drug Rehabilitation Regime in the Drug Rehabilitation Centre (DRC) in 2014.Under the enhanced regime, SPS officers will assess the inmates’ risks of re-offending and severity of drug use upon admission.For higher-risk inmates, SPS will assign Correctional Rehabilitation Specialists to conduct high-intensity counselling programmes for them. The counselling programmes address multiple risks and needs, such as criminal thinking and drug addiction issues.Lower-risk inmates will go through lower-intensity intervention programmes, where they learn about the consequences of drug use and pick up skills to prevent relapse.All DRC inmates also undergo general programmes which help them in their reintegration journey. These include family support programmes, employability skills training and religious services.SPS will continue to evaluate the effectiveness of the enhanced Drug Rehabilitation Regime. As for the enhanced regime that was only implemented in 2014, the evaluation is still ongoing."
minimum attendance to proceed with public forum,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) how many people registered for the REACH Public Forum on the Elected Presidency on 29 September 2016; (b) what was the intended attendance and how was it derived; (c) what is the threshold for attendance below which it is deemed necessary to cancel such forums; and (d) who made the final decision on cancelling that particular event.,"Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim: The target number of participants for the REACH Public Forum on the Elected Presidency on 29 September was 320. Only 80 signed up as at 27 September. As 30% of sign-ups typically do not turn up for REACH events, REACH decided to cancel the Forum due to the poor attendance. All registered participants were informed of the cancellation, and are welcomed to attend another of REACH’s dialogues, or provide their feedback through the REACH website."
commission to handle issues related to animal welfare,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry will consider setting up a dedicated commission to handle all issues related to animal welfare that is similar to the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) either by expanding the scope of the current Multi-Stakeholder Collaboration Committee for Animal Welfare or setting up a new committee comprising of animal welfare groups, businesses in the pet industry, veterinarians, grassroots community leaders and other relevant stakeholders.","Mr Lawrence Wong: There are currently no plans to set up a dedicated commission to handle issues related to animal welfare.The Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) already works closely with multi-stakeholder committees to enhance animal welfare. This approach has led to positive results. For example, AVA had close working relations with the Animal Welfare Legislative Review Committee (AWLRC), a group made up of Members of Parliament, grassroots leaders, animal welfare groups, the pet industry, and the veterinary profession. AVA worked with AWLRC in a review of Singapore’s animal welfare legislation in 2012. AVA also supported the AWLRC’s recommendations to enhance stakeholders’ collaboration in animal welfare.In addition, AVA has close working relations with the Multi-Stakeholder Collaboration Committee (MSCC), which comprises representatives from animal welfare groups, the pet industry, the veterinary profession, and the community at large. AVA worked with them on the recently issued Code of Animal Welfare for the pet industry. AVA continues to engage with the MSCC on issues relating to training for the pet industry, as well as on outreach initiatives to promote awareness about animal welfare.AVA will continue to engage with the relevant stakeholders to further the cause of animal welfare in Singapore."
programmes to help schools handle sexual assault and harassment,"Mr Chen Show Mao asked the Minister for Education (Schools) what are the programmes to help (i) schools handle sexual assault and harassment in schools and (ii) students, teachers, and staff understand their rights in cases of sexual assault and harassment.","Mr Ng Chee Meng: Students learn about personal safety and protection from sexual exploitation and abuse in MOE's Sexuality Education curriculum. They are taught how to recognise sexual abuse and harassment, acquire skills to protect themselves both in real life and online, and understand the laws in Singapore that protect them. They also learn that they have the right to safety and protection and to seek help from trusted adults, such as their parents, teachers and school counsellors.Teachers look out for signs of distress in students and refer them to the school counsellor or other professional support where necessary. Suspected cases of sexual abuse are managed sensitively. Guidelines are provided by Child Protection Services, Ministry of Social and Family Development, for reporting such cases, and MOE and schools work closely with Child Protection Services to support affected students.For teachers and staff who experienced harassment or abuse at work, they are advised to seek the support and guidance of their school leaders. Those who are psychologically or emotionally affected will be supported by professional counsellors. MOE takes a serious view of any inappropriate conduct that is committed against our teachers and staff, and will investigate and take the appropriate action in each and every case."
review of courses subsidised by wda and skillsfuture,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (a) whether the Ministry will expand the courses subsidised by WDA and SkillsFuture credits to include more professional qualifications such as Certified Internal Auditor courses or Certified Information System Auditor courses; and (b) how frequently does WDA review the relevance of its courses to keep its offerings updated.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) has been taking an inclusive approach to build up the list of courses eligible for the SkillsFuture Credit. The key consideration is relevance to work. However, we will need the co-operation of training providers as there will be administrative tasks at their end, in order for their courses to be included.SSG has reached out to training providers of preparatory courses and assessments for professional certifications under the Certified Internal Auditor (CIA) and Certified Information System Auditor (CISA) to invite them to come on board the SkillsFuture Credit. So far, SSG has included the Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants (ISCA)-CIA Challenge Exam Prep Course, delivered by the Institute of Internal Auditors, in the SkillsFuture Credit directory. SSG will continue to work with training providers to include more of such professional courses and assessments for the SkillsFuture Credit. I thank the Member for her feedback."
provision of parking lots in proposed bto development in kaki bukit,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the number of parking lots available for the newly proposed Build-To-Order (BTO) HDB development in Kaki Bukit launching in November 2016; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider constructing more parking lots to supplement the shortage of parking lots at carparks B45 and B48 of Bedok North Street 3.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The proposed HDB BTO development in Kaki Bukit located along Bedok North Avenue 1 will be provided with 66 carpark lots and 34 motorcycle lots.As for carparks B45 and B48 at Bedok North Street 3, there are currently sufficient parking lots for residents’ season parking needs. However, as these carparks also serve local amenities, such as the hawker centre and market, short-term parking demand may be high. Due to site constraints, HDB is unable to construct more parking lots at these two carparks. Nevertheless, to help ease the short-term congestion, HDB will reconfigure B45 to provide additional loading and unloading bays in the carpark. This will help to address the short-term congestion caused by goods vehicles carrying out loading and unloading activities at B45."
provision of mandatory changing facilities for babies in male and female restrooms in public buildings,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry will look into making it a requirement to have changing facilities for babies in both male and female restrooms in public buildings.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Since 2014, the Code on Accessibility already requires the provision of diaper changing facilities in both male and female restrooms. This requirement applies to buildings that are frequented by families with young children, including shopping centres, transport nodes, community centres, and sports complexes. Building owners also have the alternative of providing diaper changing facilities in individual unisex family restrooms, in lieu of having to provide them in both male and female restrooms."
average annual spending by problem gamblers from 2006 to 2015,Mr Chen Show Mao asked the Minister for Social and Family Development for each year from 2006 to 2015 (a) what has been the average spending by problem gamblers; and (b) what has been the respective percentage of the aggregate number of problem gamblers according to their household income deciles.,"Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: The National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) commissions the Survey on Participation in Gambling Activities among Singapore Residents every three years. The survey includes screening questions to detect probable pathological gamblers, based on diagnostic criteria in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) developed by the American Psychiatric Association (APA). The same diagnostic criteria have been used in similar studies in Hong Kong, Macau and the United States. As the survey is conducted via face-to-face interviews, the screening questions only capture the respondents’ self-professed behaviour and do not represent a clinical assessment of actual gambling disorders.Based on the latest survey in 2014, the proportion of respondents classified as probable pathological gamblers is 0.2%, compared to 2.1% in 2005, 1.2% in 2008 and 1.4% in 2011.The average monthly betting amount among probable pathological gamblers was $313 in 2014. This has decreased from the average monthly betting amount of $637 in 2005, $619 in 2008 and $1,713 in 2011.The surveys collected information on monthly personal income by income brackets, instead of the monthly household income. The probable pathological gambling rate by monthly personal income brackets is shown in Table A.While the probable pathological gambling rate has dropped in 2014, we cannot be complacent and will continue to monitor the trends in future runs of the survey."

Ultimately, it is more important to ensure close and effective co-operation among all the relevant stakeholders, which go beyond the developer of the building project."
staffing and caseload of serious sexual crimes branch,Mr Chen Show Mao asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is the number of officers assigned to the Serious Sexual Crimes Branch of the CID; (b) what is the rationale for the staffing numbers at the Serious Sexual Crimes Branch; (c) what is the annual number of cases investigated by the Serious Sexual Crimes Branch since its establishment; and (d) what are the criteria for referring cases to the Serious Sexual Crimes unit.,"Mr K Shanmugam: Sexual crime investigations are generally led by specialist units in the Singapore Police Force. The Serious Sexual Crimes Branch (SSCB) in the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) leads investigations into serious sexual crimes such as rape and aggravated cases of sexual assault by penetration (SAP). Specialist teams in the Police Land Divisions lead investigations in other sexual crimes, such as outrage of modesty cases, sexual penetration of minors and SAP cases that do not involve aggravating factors.The investigation officers in the SSCB and the Police Divisions are supported by other Police resources including in the fields of intelligence and forensics. Depending on the volume of cases, Police also scale up SSCB's resources where necessary, by leveraging on other investigation teams.As Member will note, the Police resources used for investigations will vary according to the needs of a case, and because investigations may cover a broad area, not everything needs to be done by SSCB. The investigation will be led by SSCB and the total investigative resources could come from a larger pool of officers.In the last three years, the SSCB investigated on average about 170 cases of rape and sexual assault by penetration each year. Nearly all these cases were solved."
betting and sweepstakes duty collections from exempted remote gambling operators,Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for Finance (a) what is the estimated betting and sweepstakes duty that will be collected from the exempted remote gambling operators; and (b) what is the financial effect of exempting Singapore Pools and the Singapore Turf Club on the total collection of betting and sweepstakes duty.,"Mr Heng Swee Keat: The certificate of exemption made under Section 26 of the Remote Gambling Act does not confer exemption from the payment of betting and sweepstakes duty. The collections received through terrestrial or remote gambling channels are both subject to the following betting duties1:(a) Totalisator and Sports Betting 25% of Gross Profits (that is, gross bets less winnings paid out); and(b) Lotteries (i.e. 4D, Singapore Sweep, TOTO) 30% of Gross Bets.Singapore Pools launched its remote gambling channel on 25 October 2016, and Singapore Turf Club is scheduled to do so on 15 November 2016. As such, it is premature to ascertain any financial impact of remote gambling on the operators or betting duties."
status of proposed integrated development at open field next to buangkok mrt station,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development what is the progress in the development of the proposed integrated development at the open field next to Buangkok MRT station.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The site is intended to house a residential development, which will be integrated with a bus interchange and Buangkok MRT station. There are also plans to include community facilities and commercial amenities.The Urban Redevelopment Authority is working closely together with other agencies on this effort, to ensure that the various uses are properly planned and integrated in the future development, bearing in mind that each of these uses has its own space and layout requirements.More details on the future development will be provided once the plans are finalised."
psychological or psychiatric issues related to problem gambling,"Mr Chen Show Mao asked the Minister for Health (a) how many people have been identified with psychological or psychiatric issues related to problem gambling in each year from 2006 to 2015; and (b) of these, what are the most common psychological or psychiatric issues identified.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Between FY08 and FY15, the number of patients seen by the National Addictions Management Service (NAMS) for suspected gambling disorder each year varies between 168 and 526, averaging 407 over the last five years.Among patients with pathological gambling treated at NAMS, the top associated psychiatric conditions were adjustment disorders, depression and substance abuse."
"government assistance to help micro, small and medium businesses venture overseas","Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Trade) (a) what has been the performance of Singapore's trade in services compared to trade in goods, especially in the context of the weak performance of the latter; and (b) how can the Government further help SMEs to export their services.","4 Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Trade) how can the Government better help the micro and small SMEs to venture overseas to tap a bigger market so that they can continue to grow.Mr Lim Hng Kiang: Growth in Singapore’s services trade has outpaced that of goods in recent years. Between 2010 and 2015, services exports grew by a robust compound annual growth rate of 6.9 percent, compared to a 0.1 percent decline in goods exports. While services exports growth has moderated since 2015, this was in line with the weakening global trade environment, and largely attributable to the slowdown in segments supporting goods trade, such as freight services. Growth remained resilient in segments such as insurance services, and telecommunications, computer and information services, which continue to see regional demand.Singapore has a broad network of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) and regional initiatives that help companies tap into external demand for our goods and services. For example, the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) allows our services exporters greater market access to the ASEAN region with restrictions lowered in more than 80 services sectors. The AEC’s continuing efforts to facilitate, protect and liberalise cross-border investments enable our companies to venture into the region at lower costs and with greater assurance.Singapore also has a suite of assistance schemes that help SMEs internationalise and trade with overseas markets. This includes the Market Readiness Assistance (MRA) and the Global Company Partnership (GCP) schemes administered by IE Singapore. The MRA provides broad-based assistance to companies that are starting to internationalise, while the GCP provides targeted assistance to companies with a more established overseas presence. The GCP covers capability and manpower development, market access and financing. Over 80 percent of the beneficiaries of these assistance measures are SMEs.The Government is also collaborating with Trade Associations and Chambers to help SMEs prepare themselves for overseas opportunities. The IE-SCCCI Singapore Enterprise Centre (ISSEC) in Shanghai which is a joint initiative between IE Singapore and the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce & Industry is an example of such collaboration. Over the past three years, ISSEC has served more than 5,000 companies through outreach and advisory assistance, and provided research on emerging market opportunities in China. The companies assisted by ISSEC are predominantly SMEs and micro enterprises. ISSEC will be going beyond Shanghai to help such firms build up market expertise and capabilities in other parts of China.IE Singapore also has an extensive network of Overseas Centres internationally that provides targeted assistance for companies in both developed and emerging markets. These include helping them generate new business leads in Southeast Asian markets such as Indonesia and Myanmar, gaining entry as first movers in emerging markets such as Africa and Latin America, and identifying opportunities to enhance technology capabilities in developed markets such as the UK and US.Companies need the right talent to embark on internationalisation plans - people who have global mindsets, exposure to international business environments, in-depth understanding of industries, and ability to navigate markets. To build a pipeline of global-ready Singaporeans for international roles, manpower development programmes are also in place. For example, IE Singapore's Young Talent Programme exposes students from universities, polytechnics and ITEs to internship opportunities in overseas markets, and equips them with foundational skills needed for international careers. Skillsfuture Study Awards for International Business are also given out to prepare professionals, managers and executives for international roles through various courses, market attachments and customised overseas immersion programmes."
scanning commuters and their belongings before entering mrt stations,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry will consider scanning commuters and their belongings before they enter MRT stations as is being done in a number of other major cities.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: A dedicated multi-agency body, the Public Transport Security Committee, constantly reviews the threat assessment by our security agencies, and recalibrates as necessary the security measures for our public transport network.We adopt a risk-based approach, so that the measures deployed can effectively mitigate the security threats, but at the same time not overly and unnecessarily impair the smooth functioning of the public transport system.Our approach comprises measures at various levels. The public transport operators engage Transit Security Officers (TSOs) to keep watch at MRT stations and bus interchanges. This is supplemented by police patrols, and CCTV surveillance coverage. Commuters also play an important role, to look out for and report suspicious persons and unattended items.We calibrate the security measures according to the prevailing threat situation. Currently, TSOs conduct checks on selected commuters and their belongings. Police officers on patrol also check on suspicious persons. If and when the security situation warrants, we will subject all commuters to security checks."
review parking violations enforced upon private estate residents,Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for Transport whether the Government will consider a review of parking enforcement legislation and policy so that private estate residents parking vehicles in front of their own gates without causing obstruction to pedestrian paths or road users can be exempted from enforcement for parking violations.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: For parking provisions in private estates, the Land Transport Authority adopts a consultative approach and works with Neighbourhood Committees, grassroots leaders and resident groups to strike a balance between meeting parking needs and ensuring safety and smooth traffic flow.Rules, once instituted, will have to be uniformly applied to all, residents and non-residents alike. The Government cannot be giving to residents of private estates exemptions from the law in the use of public roads, to which other Singaporeans are subject."
civil servants in part-time and job-sharing arrangements,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Prime Minister (a) over the last five years, what is the number of civil servants engaged in (i) part-time work arrangements and (ii) job-sharing arrangements; and (b) how are Ministries and statutory boards ensuring more mothers and caregivers are provided with flexible work arrangements.","Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): The number of public officers on part-time work arrangements increased from 1,415 in 2011 to 2,019 officers in 2015. We do not track the number of public officers who are job-sharing while on part-time work arrangements.The range of flexible work arrangements offered by our agencies includes staggered start-work hours, telecommuting and part-time work. Public officers, including mothers and caregivers, may apply for such flexible work arrangements, where their job nature allows. Besides flexible work arrangements, we also support mothers and caregivers through various leave provisions, such as parent-care leave, childcare leave, maternity leave and paternity leave."
extending use of private education institution student concession card to returning singaporean children,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Transport whether the Private Education Institution Student Concession Card for secondary-level home-schooled students can be extended to returning Singaporean children who have completed an examination equivalent to the PSLE while overseas.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: All secondary-level home-schooling Singapore citizens aged 20 and below, including those who have returned from overseas, are eligible for a Private Education Institute Student Concession Card if they are pursuing the General Certification of Examination (GCE) Normal, Ordinary or Advanced Level qualification, or an International Baccalaureate qualification."
meetings of council of presidential advisers,Mr Leon Perera asked the Prime Minister from FY2012 to FY2016 (a) how many meetings of the Council of Presidential Advisers have been held each year; (b) what is the duration of each meeting; and (c) how many Council members attended each meeting.,"Mr Lee Hsien Loong: The Council of Presidential Advisers held between 10 and 17 meetings a year during that period (FY2012 to FY2015). Each meeting lasted up to two hours. In general, attendance at Council meetings was between 6 to 8 members, including the alternate members."
national output and income indicators for indigenous singaporeans from 2012 to 2015,Mr Chen Show Mao asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Trade) for each year from 2012 to 2015 (a) what is Singapore's indigenous GDP; (b) what is Singapore's per capita indigenous GDP; (c) what is Singapore's indigenous GNI; and (d) what is Singapore's per capita indigenous GNI.,"Mr Lim Hng Kiang: Singapore’s indigenous GDP, GDP per capita, GNI and GNI per capita valued at current market prices for the years 2012 to 2015 are provided in the table below."
prevalence of diabetes among household types,"Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin asked the Minister for Health (a) which households by income level and housing type have the highest prevalence of diabetes; (b) what strategies are employed to help lower-income families win their war against diabetes; and (c) how is the Ministry working with other sectors to ensure that vulnerable families have access to nutritious, non-processed food given that diet is important in managing the disease but too expensive an option for lower-income homes.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: The correlation between socio-economic background and diabetes prevalence is a commonly-observed and widely-reported phenomenon worldwide. MOH's National Health Survey showed a similar correlation where those in smaller housing type and lower education level had higher prevalence of diabetes. However, the same survey also showed that they have good access to care.MOH’s strategy on diabetes emphasises healthy eating and physical activity; appropriate screening and follow-up; and effective diabetes care and management. These efforts must be accessible and affordable to the lower income.In promoting healthier eating, HPB's Healthier Choice Symbol (HCS) Programme offers a wide range of healthier product options, including house brands, which are typically more affordable. HPB has also distributed almost 200,000 Health Calendars which feature low-cost healthy recipes, exercises and self-care tips to women aged 40 years and above in lower-income households.For dining out options, HPB has partnered major foodcourt chains, including Kopitiam and NTUC Foodfare, to offer affordable lower-calorie dishes. HPB also works with primary school canteen vendors to provide nutritious breakfast meals to needy students under MOE's Financial Assistance Scheme.On health screening, MOH ensures that it is available to lower-income Singaporeans at highly subsidised prices. Under our Screen for Life (SFL) programme offered at Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) GPs, screening tests for chronic diseases, including diabetes, are free. Patients in the lowest income tier and Pioneers enjoy a subsidy of up to $18.50 and $28.50 respectively for consultation fees. HPB and its partners also reach out proactively to lower-income Singaporeans, such as those in HDB rental blocks, to encourage and facilitate regular health screening.Singaporeans with diabetes, as with other conditions, can receive subsidies for their treatment at CHAS GPs, polyclinics and specialist outpatient clinics in the public hospitals. Those with lower-income receive higher subsidies.The national Diabetes Prevention and Care Taskforce will step up public education to ensure that Singaporeans of all socio-economic backgrounds lead a healthy lifestyle and practice effective diabetes care and management."
arrests made for attempted suicides,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) how many arrests have been made last year for attempted suicides; (b) whether police officers making these arrests are trained to follow any specific protocol or approach which differs from arrests for other offences; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider having police suicide prevention practices that do not involve arrests.,"Mr K Shanmugam: It has been a criminal offence to attempt suicide. It was thought to be important that society should oppose people taking their own lives. In practice, prosecutions are rare.Police officers try to respond to cases of attempted suicide with sensitivity and compassion. Persons who attempt suicide are emotionally and psychologically distressed. When responding to such cases, Police's priority is to ensure the person's safety. Police officers try to look out for signs of suicidal tendencies, and take this into consideration in their response.As regards arrests, Police arrest persons for cases of attempted suicide usually to prevent them from doing harm, either to themselves or to others. When it is assessed that there is no such risk, they may not be arrested. It is on this basis that 837 persons were taken into custody for attempting suicide, out of 1096 cases of attempted suicide reported in 2015. However, only two of them were eventually prosecuted.For all cases of attempted suicide, Police will recommend the appropriate follow-up. Police may refer the person to the Samaritans of Singapore for counselling, or engage the next-of-kin to assist in supporting and caring for the person. If there are clear signs indicating possible mental instability, Police may refer the person to the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) for an assessment of the person's mental state. If deemed necessary by medical professionals, the person may subsequently be warded at IMH for care and treatment."
measures to detect and reduce incidence of tuberculosis,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Health what are the measures in place to detect tuberculosis and reduce its incidence in Singapore.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Early detection and prompt treatment of active cases is key to controlling the spread of tuberculosis (TB) in Singapore. Persons with symptoms of active TB, such as a prolonged cough of more than three weeks, are advised to seek early medical assessment. For those on treatment, adherence is crucial to prevent recurrence or development of drug resistance.TB is endemic in Singapore and in the region and there are measures in place to prevent importation of TB. Work permit applicants are required to undergo a medical examination upon arrival to Singapore. This includes a Chest X-ray to rule out active TB disease.We also work to prevent the spread of TB. Doctors are reminded to look out for cases of possible TB. Once cases are diagnosed, the doctors are required to notify the Ministry of Health. The Tuberculosis Control Unit (TBCU) then identifies those who had prolonged and close contact with the TB patient, such as household members and workplace colleagues, to undergo screening for TB, as they have the highest risk of contracting the disease. Those found to have latent TB, which is TB without any symptoms and is not infectious, may be placed on treatment to prevent development of active TB. This practice is aligned with the World Health Organization’s recommendations, and practices in other developed countries. In addition, to better understand the spread of disease and to identify clusters, TBCU conducts DNA fingerprinting studies.We have made some progress in reducing the rates of TB in Singapore. Among Singapore citizens and permanent residents, the number of new cases has fallen from 52 per 100,000 persons in 1995 to 38 per 100,000 persons last year. We will continue to work on reducing TB as a public health threat."
raising awareness amongst foreign workers on hygiene and work practices,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether the Ministry hands out brochures to foreign workers in their native language to educate them about hygiene and work practices here when they first arrive in Singapore; and (b) whether the Ministry is aware that the littering problem in some dormitories is very serious especially during weekends.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: MOM gives all foreign workers a Handy Guide in their native language when they first arrive to help them adjust to working and living in Singapore. The guide educates them about their employment rights and responsibilities, as well as the consequences of not complying with our laws. It also provides practical advice to help them settle down, such as good hygiene practices, safe work practices and channels of assistance if they encounter problems. These messages are reinforced in MOM's newsletters and the roadshows for foreign workers that MOM conducts jointly with other agencies. MOM also appoints Foreign Worker Ambassadors who help provide advice to foreign workers staying in their dormitories.Member raised the issue of littering in dormitories. Dormitory operators are expected to maintain the cleanliness of their dormitory premises at all times. MOM regularly inspects dormitories, and will ask operators to make improvements if the living conditions are found to be unsatisfactory. Where the well-being of the workers is compromised as a result of poor dormitory conditions, MOM will take enforcement action against the errant operators. We urge anyone with information on specific dormitories that have serious littering issues to report these to MOM."
review of quantum of penalties and compensation for workplace incidents,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Manpower whether the quantum of penalties for workplace safety and health and quantum of compensation for work injuries will be reviewed to promote workplace safety.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: In 2006, the Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Act introduced a maximum penalty of $500,000 for failing to take reasonably practicable measures to ensure workers' health and safety. This was an increase from the $200,000 penalty under the old Factories Act1. MOM has been making strong representations to the State Courts, for penalties to be increased to reflect the severe consequences of failing to comply with the WSH Act. The penalties imposed by the State Courts have been increasing, with the highest fine to date being $220,000. MOM will continue to seek deterrent sentences in appropriate cases. There is therefore no need at this time, to consider further raising the maximum penalty under the WSH Act.The compensation limits for death, total permanent incapacity and medical expenses under the Work Injury Compensation Act was only just reviewed in 2015. From 1 January 2016, the compensation limits were increased by between 20% and 30%, in order to keep payouts in line with rising incomes and healthcare costs."
special dependant pass for foreign women with singapore citizen spouses or children,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether foreign spouses of Singapore citizens who are mothers of children who are Singapore citizens or pregnant with children who will be Singapore citizens should be issued a special dependant pass so that the mothers will not need to be interviewed by ICA officers at the checkpoints.,"Mr K Shanmugam: Our priority is to ensure the security of Singapore’s borders. All travellers, including Singapore citizens and Permanent Residents, are required to undergo security checks and screening at the checkpoints. Where necessary, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) may conduct further interviews and checks.There is no reason or justification from a security perspective to state that an entire category will be exempted from interviews – including foreign spouses of Singapore citizens. There is no blanket exemption even for Singaporeans – where necessary, ICA interviews Singaporeans.To pre-exempt any person or group from such checks and interviews will create a security gap. Once you announce to the world that a certain group will not be interviewed or checked, then you effectively announce to the terrorists which route can be exploited.We can be compassionate, but should not engage in practices which are innocent of the ways of terror.ICA facilitates the clearance of travellers with special needs, such as pregnant women or elderly persons, where necessary and practicable. This, however, has to be done without compromising security."
pilot programme to video record statements from suspects,Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is the status of the pilot programme for the police to video record statements from suspects; (b) what is the rate of submission of video recorded statements as evidence in trials; and (c) what are the plans to extend video recording of statements from suspects to all cases handled by the police and local law enforcement agencies.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The inter-agency workgroup on Video Recording of Interviews (VRI) has completed a round of consultations with the legal community, including the Law Society of Singapore and the Judiciary.MHA had previously announced that we will start a pilot of VRI in the first quarter of 2016. After taking into account the feedback received, we have decided that it would be better to first put in place the necessary legislative amendments before starting the VRI pilot. This was announced during the opening of the Criminal Law Conference on 14 July 2016. The legal framework will set out the procedures, admissibility and disclosure regime.We will announce details on the legislative amendments and the VRI pilot in due course."
publication of national output and income indicators of indigenous singaporeans,Mr Chen Show Mao asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Trade) why the Ministry has stopped publishing the indigenous GDP and GNI in the annual Yearbook of Statistics since 2013.,"Mr Lim Hng Kiang: The Department of Statistics (DOS) conducts regular reviews of the data series that it publishes, and may decide to stop the publication of those which are assessed to have low demand.In the case of the indigenous GDP and GNI series, DOS decided to stop publishing them with effect from the 2013 Yearbook of Statistics Singapore as there was a lack of public interest in the two series. In particular, there were no online downloads of the series nor specific queries on the series from the public in the years leading up to the decision to stop the publication of the series.Nonetheless, DOS has continued to compile the two series internally and will provide them to users on request."
divorce and marriage trends by income group,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) over the last three years, what has been the number of divorces for each income group of our population and the percentage in relation to the total number of marriages; (b) how many of them involved foreign spouses and what is the percentage in relation to the total number of marriages to foreigners for each income group; and (c) whether there is an upward trend in such divorces and, if so, what are the measures that the Ministry is taking to address the trend.","Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: MSF tracks marriage dissolution on a marriage cohort basis. Marriage dissolution comprises divorces and annulments (with divorces making up about 95% of all dissolutions). Marriage cohort dissolution rates refer to the cumulative proportion of marriages from a particular year that have dissolved by a certain year.We have used the 2007 to 2009 marriage cohorts as we can more meaningfully compare dissolution rates before the 5th anniversary from date of marriage onwards.The population is defined as ‘resident marriages’, ie, marriages involving at least 1 Singapore Citizen (SC) or Permanent Resident (PR). In addition, educational qualification is used as a proxy for income, as income is not a compulsory field when couples file for marriage locally.For couples who married in 2007 to 2009, the number of dissolved marriages before the 5th anniversary for resident marriages remained relatively stable at around 1500 to 1600 per year (dissolution rate of 6.4% to 6.8%). In general, the number of dissolved marriages was lower for marriages involving grooms with higher educational qualifications attained (see tables 1A-1D). The number of marriages between a Singapore Citizen (SC) and a Non-Resident (NR) was around 6,000 to 7,000 for the three marriage cohorts from 2007 to 2009. Of these, around 400 to 500 marriages of each marriage cohort (7.1% to 7.9%) dissolved before the 5th anniversary. Based on the three marriage cohorts from 2007 to 2009, there appears to be an upward trend but more data points are required to confirm the trend.The Ministry recognises that SC-NR marriages face unique challenges. As such, we have introduced marriage programmes in December 2014 to help these couples manage cross-cultural differences as they settle down in Singapore, and to strengthen their marriages. These programmes include the Marriage Preparation Programme offered before marriage, the Marriage Support Programme for newly-weds, and the Friendship Programme, which comprises family bonding activities, support group sessions and pairing of volunteers to foreign spouses as ""buddies"".The Ministry has also expanded marriage support for young couples. For couples marrying on and after 1 October 2016, couples where at least one party is below 21 years old will be required to attend a Marriage Preparation Programme conducted by MSF-approved organisations, before a marriage license can be issued. This requirement is in addition to prior parental consent. These programmes, which include a component on financial planning, help couples build strong marriages, regardless of income or education."
problem gambling cases with history of online gambling,"Dr Tan Wu Meng asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) over the past one year, what proportion of problem gambling cases has a history of online gambling; (b) what proportion of cases is primarily online gambling; (c) what proportion of cases has found online gambling to be a gateway to offline gambling; and (d) what are the safeguards which the Ministry will introduce to safeguard the public from the harm of online gambling should local betting providers enter the sector.","Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: Problem gamblers and their families can seek help through the National Council on Problem Gambling, or approach other avenues like the National Addictions Management Service (NAMS) at the Institute of Mental Health directly. There are also other community and religious organisations that offer help services for gambling addiction. The list of help services is available on the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) website.Thye Hua Kwan saw 287 problem gambling cases in 2015; NAMS saw 370 new cases between April 2015 and March 2016. Based on an ongoing project conducted by NAMS to monitor 114 patients’ progress in treatment outcome in FY15, 39.5% reported involvement in online gambling. As problem gamblers tend to be involved in both online and offline gambling, it is difficult to delineate the cases that are primarily due to online gambling or where online gambling is a gateway to offline gambling.MSF has worked closely with MHA to develop a range of social safeguards for the exempt operators to implement, to protect young persons and other vulnerable persons from the harms of remote gambling.To prevent youth gambling, all account holders must be at least 21 years old before they can open a remote gambling account. The exempt operators (EOs) have to carry out stringent checks to verify the identity of the applicant, such as a face-to-face verification at physical outlets with a valid NRIC/FIN and screening of existing casino exclusions with the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG), before an account can be opened.To protect financially vulnerable individuals, persons who have been excluded from casinos due to family objection or their financial situation will not be allowed to open an account. Individuals can also apply to exclude themselves from remote gambling.To prevent over-spending and addiction, all account holders will be required to set a daily expenditure limit and funding limit before they are allowed to place bets. Funding limit means the maximum amount that can be transferred or deposited into the account per calendar day, while expenditure limit means the maximum amount that can be used for betting per calendar day. Once they have reached their expenditure limits, they will no longer be allowed to place any bets for the rest of the day. As an additional safeguard, any request to increase their expenditure limit will only take place the next day, while requests to reduce their expenditure limit will be effective immediately.To facilitate informed play, the EOs are required to display responsible gambling messages prominently, such as the time and amount spent, the total win/losses for the day, and alert the individual if he has reached or exceeded 75% of his daily expenditure limit.Lastly, the EOs will be required to submit all advertising and promotions (A&P) materials to MSF for approval. Advertisements and promotions must not induce gambling.NCPG has been active in rolling out prevention programmes to complement the stringent safeguards for remote gambling. For example, NCPG partners TOUCH Cyber Wellness and Fei Yue Community Services to deliver cyber wellness roadshows and talks to students and parents. NCPG also launches public education campaigns and videos to highlight the risks of problem gambling. One of the recent videos has a backdrop of sports betting and illegal online betting, to educate youths on spotting the signs of problem gambling and helping their friends in need. Another features popular getai MC Wang Lei relating his struggles with problem gambling and the importance of family support in helping him recover from problem gambling.While the Government puts in place stringent safeguards, complemented with NCPG's public education efforts, personal responsibility as well as family and community support are still essential to address this complex issue of problem gambling."
government agencies with qualified or adverse accounts from auditors in past 20 years,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Finance in the past 20 years (a) how many Government-related bodies have received qualified accounts or adverse accounts by their auditors; and (b) what are the names of the bodies and the years for which the accounts were so classified.,"Mr Heng Swee Keat: The Government Financial Statements, which cover the accounts of all Ministries, Departments and Organs of State, received unqualified audit opinions over the past 20 years.For the 64 statutory boards (SBs), in the last 20 years, seven of them received qualified audit opinions.- Six2 SBs, namely Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS), Land Transport Authority (LTA), National Arts Council (NAC), People’s Association (PA), Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) and Public Utilities Board (PUB), received qualified opinions between FY2005 and FY2006 as they did not meet the revised Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (SFRS) 24. This was a new requirement issued in 2004, which required SBs to disclose transactions with other state-controlled entities.- PUB also received a Disclaimer of Opinion for FY2000 as auditors were not able to verify the reasonableness of the water sales revenue, due to problems with the billing agent's computer system that resulted in unavailability of reliable records.- The Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB) received a Qualified Opinion for FY2004, for not complying with the Projected Unit Credit method to determine the present value of its obligations under the employee pension plan.- MUIS received a Qualified Opinion for FY2001 for not consolidating the financial statements of one of its subsidiaries.- PA received qualified financial statements for several years prior to FY2013, for the main reason of not including the accounts of its grassroots organisations in PA's accounts.In all the above instances, the qualifications were due to isolated causes. There was no evidence of widespread non-compliance and the SBs took prompt action to rectify the qualifications. This is why six of the SBs – MUIS, LTA, NAC, PUB, URA and SEAB – received unqualified audit opinions the following year after the audit observations. Their auditors had found that the financial statements of these SBs were all properly drawn up, and that the accounting, finances and other records were in order, and in accordance with the provisions of their respective Acts.In the case of PA, as explained in Parliament on 17 August 2015, PA had since taken steps to consolidate all the 1,800 grassroots accounts into PA's financial statements, to be in full compliance with the Accounting Standards. PA has received unqualified audit opinions since FY2013."
cases dealt with by commissioner and tribunal for maintenance of parents,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) how many cases have been mediated by the Commissioner for the Maintenance of Parents in 2015 and 2016; (b) how many cases have been heard at the Tribunal for the Maintenance of Parents in 2015 and 2016; and (c) what plans does the Ministry have to reduce the number of such cases.,"Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: The Maintenance of Parents Act takes a ""conciliation first"" approach, with legal action as a last resort. This approach started in 2011 when the Act was amended to create the office of the Commissioner for the Maintenance of Parents.The Commissioner conciliated 221 cases in 2015 and 136 from January till August 2016. Since 2011, we have seen encouraging results with a resolution rate of about 80%.With upfront conciliation by the Commissioner, there have been fewer maintenance applications filed at the Tribunal for the Maintenance of Parents. This has also reduced acrimony and discontent between parties. Prior to 2011, the three-year average number of new applications at the Tribunal was 170. It fell to an average of 67 per year for 2012-2014. In 2015, the number was 36 and from January till August 2016, 51 applications have been filed.At the heart of most cases is poor family relations. This could be caused by irresponsible parenting, deep rooted conflict in the family or a lack of filial piety. The Ministry will continue to promote filial piety and responsible parenting and, in particular, encourage fathers to be actively involved in raising their children. Such efforts aim to strengthen family bonds, and reduce the need for elderly parents to resort to legal recourse for maintenance. In addition, in instances where the children cannot maintain their parents, for example, they themselves are on social support or are incarcerated, the Tribunal and the Commissioner would refer such elderly to the SSOs. The aim is to ensure that the elderly's basic needs are met, but it does also reduce the number of cases officially filed."
price difference between bto and resale flats,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development (a) in the past one year, what is the average price difference between BTO flats (with and without subsidy) and resale flats for each flat type in the same district/zone; and (b) what is the average price difference between BTO flats in new towns and mature towns next to the new towns.","Mr Lawrence Wong: (a) Price Difference between BTO and Resale Flats.In pricing new flats, HDB takes reference from the prices of comparable resale flats, makes adjustments for differences in location and attributes, and then gives a discount to ensure that new flat prices remain affordable, especially for first-timer families.The difference between the average prices of BTO flats and resale flats in non-mature estates in the past one year ranged from $108,000 for 3-room flats to $71,000 for 5-room flats. There were too few 2-room resale flat transactions for a meaningful comparison. However, direct comparisons between BTO and resale flat prices may not be appropriate or meaningful, as these flats would differ in terms of age, design features, and proximity to infrastructure and amenities within the town.In addition, first-timer families who are eligible for housing grants will enjoy up to $80,000 in grants, comprising the Additional CPF Housing Grant (AHG) of up to $40,000 and the Special CPF Housing Grant of up to $40,000. On the other hand, these eligible first-timer families buying resale flats also enjoy up to $90,000 in grants, comprising the CPF Housing Grant of $30,000, the AHG of up to $40,000, and the Proximity Housing Grant of $20,000.(b) Price Difference between BTO Flats in Non-Mature and Mature Estates.Flat prices are generally higher in the mature estates as they are nearer to the city centre and have higher demand. For example, the difference between the average prices of 4-room BTO flats offered in the past one year in Sengkang, a non-mature estate, and Ang Mo Kio, a nearby mature estate, is $162,000."
success rates for applicants for hdb's fresh start housing and two-room flexi schemes,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development (a) how many successful applicants have benefited from HDB's Fresh Start Housing Scheme and Two-Room Flexi scheme respectively since their launch; (b) of the unsuccessful applicants under the Two-Room Flexi scheme, how many of them are (i) aged 55 years and below and (ii) aged 55 years and above; and (c) whether HDB intends to increase the supply of such flats.","Mr Lawrence Wong: (a) Two-Room Flexi Scheme.HDB has offered close to 7,800 2-room Flexi flats since its introduction in the November 2015 sales exercise. Of these, about 3,700 flats have been booked, and about 4,100 flats are still undergoing selection.To date, flat selection has been fully completed only for the Nov 2015 BTO exercise. For that exercise, more than 70% of the applicants are aged below 55, and these are applications for the 2-room 99-year lease flats. The remainder 30% is aged 55 or above, who mostly opt for the 2-room short lease flats. Among the unsuccessful applicants, about nine in 10 are aged below 55, and the majority of them are singles.HDB will continue to monitor the demand from all buyer groups and calibrate the flat supply judiciously.(b) Fresh Start Housing Scheme.The Fresh Start Housing Scheme is not yet available for application. We target to initiate the application process by end-2016. More details will be announced nearer to the date."
options for executive condominium owners who have not met minimum occupation period,"Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for National Development for owners of Executive Condominiums who have not completed the Minimum Occupation Period, what sale and accommodation options are available to them when they divorce particularly if they have children.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Owners who have bought an Executive Condominium (EC) unit from the developer are required to fulfil the 5-year Minimum Occupation Period (MOP) before they can sell it in the open market.Where the owners are divorced before completing the MOP of the EC unit, one party may retain the EC unit if he/she meets the eligibility conditions to own an EC unit. Divorcees with children under their custody, care and control form an eligible family nucleus and would be able to retain the EC unit. Divorcees who have no children under their custody, care and control may include their parents or a new spouse as a co-owner to retain the EC unit.If none of the owners are eligible to retain the EC unit, HDB may consider allowing them to sell the unit before fulfilling the MOP, based on the merits of the case. The divorced parties may then seek out alternative housing options on their own, including staying with family members, buying a resale flat, or renting a room or flat from the open market."
response to trial of elderly monitoring system and utilities management system,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for National Development how have residents in Yuhua responded to the trial of the Elderly Monitoring System and Utilities Management System and when will these systems be made available to residents in other constituencies.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: In October 2015, HDB and partner agencies carried out a small-scale trial of smart home solutions, comprising the Elderly Monitoring System and the Utilities Management System, for 10 households in Yuhua.Feedback from the participating households has been encouraging. The residents felt that the Elderly Monitoring System was not intrusive, easy to use and gave them peace of mind when their elderly family members were alone at home. The residents also shared that the Utilities Management System has helped them in tracking their utility bills and led to cost savings, some as high as 15%.In April 2016, the trial was expanded to another 3,200 households in Yuhua, where residents could purchase smart home solutions packages from commercial providers, including the Elderly Monitoring System and Utilities Management System. Outreach efforts are currently ongoing.HDB will study the outcome of the expanded trial before deciding whether to implement the systems in other constituencies."
criteria for priority under selective en bloc redevelopment scheme,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for National Development how does HDB decide on the housing blocks to be given redevelopment priority under the Selective En Bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS) in the event that their characteristics in qualifying for SERS are similar.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The identification of precincts for the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS) involves a careful evaluation of various factors on a site-by-site basis. As the name suggests, the identification of suitable precincts for SERS is on a highly selective basis.First, it will depend on the economic viability of the project. This takes into account the potential for redevelopment of the site, the cost of acquisition and related costs, and rehousing benefits and grants.Second, there must be suitable sites available to rehouse the residents together. This is important for preserving community ties.Third, there needs to be sufficient financial resources to fund the SERS programme.Blocks with characteristics that qualify for SERS will be carefully evaluated and announced for SERS progressively."
free sunday parking for residents of new estates,Ms Sun Xueling asked the Minister for National Development when residents of new estates can reasonably expect free Sunday parking to be made available to them given that normally the response has been to wait for the demand of parking lots to stabilise.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: For new developments, HDB has to monitor the parking situation at the car park for a period of time, to determine residents’ parking needs as they progressively move into their new homes. Thereafter, if HDB determines that the residents’ parking needs have been met, HDB can consider making free Sunday parking available.The monitoring period generally takes about six months, depending on the number of dwelling units in the development. This is only a guide and a longer monitoring period could be required if there are changes to car park provision in the surrounding areas. This is to ensure that car park demand is assessed holistically, and minimise any unhappiness arising from a situation where the FPS has to be withdrawn after it has been implemented."
statement of accounts and financial statements for 2015 sea games,"Mr Chen Show Mao asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) whether the statement of accounts and financial statements of the 2015 South East Asian Games will be disclosed to the public; (b) if so, when and, if not, why not; and (c) whether there are any net gains or deficits incurred by the 2015 SEA Games 2015 and, if so, what are they.","Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: The income and expenditure for the organisation of the 28th Southeast Asian Games have been included in the Annual Financial Statements of the Sport Singapore Annual Reports over Financial Years 2013, 2014 and 2015. These have been independently audited and made public. The net cost was $60.4 million below the budgeted $324.5 million announced in January 2015."
grassroots leaders and advisers receiving government benefits,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) how many grassroots leaders and advisers who receive Government benefits are members of the People's Action Party (PAP) branches but not volunteers with the People's Association (PA); and (b) how many are both PAP members and PA volunteers.","Mr Chan Chun Sing (for the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth: Only grassroots volunteers will qualify for recognition schemes meant for grassroots volunteers. PA does not require grassroots volunteers to declare their political affiliations and therefore does not have such records."
support in schools for students struggling with suicide and other mental health issues,Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin asked the Acting Minister for Education (Schools) (a) how do schools handle discussions with students after one of their peers has committed suicide; (b) how do schools work with experts and organisations to support students struggling with suicide; (c) whether every school has access to professionals trained in mental health awareness for students to understand youth suicide; and (d) whether the Ministry can prototype a mindfulness programme that sets aside time for students to have personal and peer-to-peer reflection on how they are dealing with life's troubles.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: Every school has a trained school counsellor. Teachers refer students who show signs of distress to their school counsellor who is trained to support students with psychological and mental health-related issues such as anxiety, depression, relationship problems and suicidal behaviours.Students who are assessed by school counsellors to be at high risk of suicide or severe mental health disorders are referred to multidisciplinary Response, Early Intervention and Assessment in Community Mental Health (REACH) teams and other social service agencies to provide additional professional support for the students and their families.When a student suicide occurs, MOE immediately activates the CARE (Caring Actions in Support of an Emergency) teams to help staff and students cope with the psychological distress caused by the incident. These CARE teams comprise teachers and school counsellors in the school and MOE HQ who have been specially trained to handle sessions with affected students and to monitor and strengthen their coping skills. Students are reminded to be supportive of one another and to encourage their friends to seek help from a trusted adult when they feel overwhelmed. Parents are also provided with relevant information and resources to support their children.MOE has stepped up efforts to nurture the social and emotional competencies of students. From primary school through to secondary school, students are explicitly taught time management, relationship management, coping strategies and ways to maintain good mental well-being such as deep breathing exercises and relaxation techniques. They also have opportunities to practise and reflect on their social and emotional learning during camps and co-curricular activities. Form teachers are provided with time to foster positive teacher-student relationships and all teachers are equipped to provide the first line of care and support. Twenty-four-hour helplines supported by agencies such as SOS and Singapore Children's Society are printed in all school handbooks."
teacher's feedback for new psle scoring system,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Acting Minister for Education (Schools) what research was conducted amongst teachers and how were their inputs taken into account in the decision-making process for the new PSLE scoring system.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: Over the course of the review of the PSLE scoring system, MOE solicited views from various key stakeholders, including educators, parents and members of the public.Our engagements first started during the Our Singapore Conversation (OSC) exercise in 2013, which touched on changes to the PSLE, amongst other education issues. Since then, MOE has run several rounds of focus group discussions and dialogues with our educators and other stakeholders, to test various proposals on PSLE scoring and Secondary One (S1) posting with them. The PSLE scoring system review was therefore well-informed by the feedback from educators, as well as the professional advice from our education and assessment specialists, including the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board. These professional input help ensure that our policy recommendations for the revised system are robustly tested, to be educationally sound and meaningful.Apart from policy design, our educators have provided useful feedback on implementation issues, which MOE will be taking into consideration. This includes feedback regarding school-based assessments in our primary schools, as well as ways in which students and parents can be supported in choosing secondary schools that best meet each student's learning needs and interests.In the lead up to the implementation of the new PSLE scoring system, MOE will continue to partner educators and other key stakeholders to ensure that the changes are smoothly implemented."
national output and income indicators for indigenous singaporeans from 2012 to 2015,Mr Chen Show Mao asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Trade) for each year from 2012 to 2015 (a) what is Singapore's indigenous GDP; (b) what is Singapore's per capita indigenous GDP; (c) what is Singapore's indigenous GNI; and (d) what is Singapore's per capita indigenous GNI.,"Mr Lim Hng Kiang: Singapore’s indigenous GDP, GDP per capita, GNI and GNI per capita valued at current market prices for the years 2012 to 2015 are provided in the table below."
prevalence of diabetes among household types,"Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin asked the Minister for Health (a) which households by income level and housing type have the highest prevalence of diabetes; (b) what strategies are employed to help lower-income families win their war against diabetes; and (c) how is the Ministry working with other sectors to ensure that vulnerable families have access to nutritious, non-processed food given that diet is important in managing the disease but too expensive an option for lower-income homes.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: The correlation between socio-economic background and diabetes prevalence is a commonly-observed and widely-reported phenomenon worldwide. MOH's National Health Survey showed a similar correlation where those in smaller housing type and lower education level had higher prevalence of diabetes. However, the same survey also showed that they have good access to care.MOH’s strategy on diabetes emphasises healthy eating and physical activity; appropriate screening and follow-up; and effective diabetes care and management. These efforts must be accessible and affordable to the lower income.In promoting healthier eating, HPB's Healthier Choice Symbol (HCS) Programme offers a wide range of healthier product options, including house brands, which are typically more affordable. HPB has also distributed almost 200,000 Health Calendars which feature low-cost healthy recipes, exercises and self-care tips to women aged 40 years and above in lower-income households.For dining out options, HPB has partnered major foodcourt chains, including Kopitiam and NTUC Foodfare, to offer affordable lower-calorie dishes. HPB also works with primary school canteen vendors to provide nutritious breakfast meals to needy students under MOE's Financial Assistance Scheme.On health screening, MOH ensures that it is available to lower-income Singaporeans at highly subsidised prices. Under our Screen for Life (SFL) programme offered at Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) GPs, screening tests for chronic diseases, including diabetes, are free. Patients in the lowest income tier and Pioneers enjoy a subsidy of up to $18.50 and $28.50 respectively for consultation fees. HPB and its partners also reach out proactively to lower-income Singaporeans, such as those in HDB rental blocks, to encourage and facilitate regular health screening.Singaporeans with diabetes, as with other conditions, can receive subsidies for their treatment at CHAS GPs, polyclinics and specialist outpatient clinics in the public hospitals. Those with lower-income receive higher subsidies.The national Diabetes Prevention and Care Taskforce will step up public education to ensure that Singaporeans of all socio-economic backgrounds lead a healthy lifestyle and practice effective diabetes care and management."
arrests made for attempted suicides,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) how many arrests have been made last year for attempted suicides; (b) whether police officers making these arrests are trained to follow any specific protocol or approach which differs from arrests for other offences; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider having police suicide prevention practices that do not involve arrests.,"Mr K Shanmugam: It has been a criminal offence to attempt suicide. It was thought to be important that society should oppose people taking their own lives. In practice, prosecutions are rare.Police officers try to respond to cases of attempted suicide with sensitivity and compassion. Persons who attempt suicide are emotionally and psychologically distressed. When responding to such cases, Police's priority is to ensure the person's safety. Police officers try to look out for signs of suicidal tendencies, and take this into consideration in their response.As regards arrests, Police arrest persons for cases of attempted suicide usually to prevent them from doing harm, either to themselves or to others. When it is assessed that there is no such risk, they may not be arrested. It is on this basis that 837 persons were taken into custody for attempting suicide, out of 1096 cases of attempted suicide reported in 2015. However, only two of them were eventually prosecuted.For all cases of attempted suicide, Police will recommend the appropriate follow-up. Police may refer the person to the Samaritans of Singapore for counselling, or engage the next-of-kin to assist in supporting and caring for the person. If there are clear signs indicating possible mental instability, Police may refer the person to the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) for an assessment of the person's mental state. If deemed necessary by medical professionals, the person may subsequently be warded at IMH for care and treatment."
measures to detect and reduce incidence of tuberculosis,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Health what are the measures in place to detect tuberculosis and reduce its incidence in Singapore.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Early detection and prompt treatment of active cases is key to controlling the spread of tuberculosis (TB) in Singapore. Persons with symptoms of active TB, such as a prolonged cough of more than three weeks, are advised to seek early medical assessment. For those on treatment, adherence is crucial to prevent recurrence or development of drug resistance.TB is endemic in Singapore and in the region and there are measures in place to prevent importation of TB. Work permit applicants are required to undergo a medical examination upon arrival to Singapore. This includes a Chest X-ray to rule out active TB disease.We also work to prevent the spread of TB. Doctors are reminded to look out for cases of possible TB. Once cases are diagnosed, the doctors are required to notify the Ministry of Health. The Tuberculosis Control Unit (TBCU) then identifies those who had prolonged and close contact with the TB patient, such as household members and workplace colleagues, to undergo screening for TB, as they have the highest risk of contracting the disease. Those found to have latent TB, which is TB without any symptoms and is not infectious, may be placed on treatment to prevent development of active TB. This practice is aligned with the World Health Organization’s recommendations, and practices in other developed countries. In addition, to better understand the spread of disease and to identify clusters, TBCU conducts DNA fingerprinting studies.We have made some progress in reducing the rates of TB in Singapore. Among Singapore citizens and permanent residents, the number of new cases has fallen from 52 per 100,000 persons in 1995 to 38 per 100,000 persons last year. We will continue to work on reducing TB as a public health threat."
raising awareness amongst foreign workers on hygiene and work practices,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether the Ministry hands out brochures to foreign workers in their native language to educate them about hygiene and work practices here when they first arrive in Singapore; and (b) whether the Ministry is aware that the littering problem in some dormitories is very serious especially during weekends.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: MOM gives all foreign workers a Handy Guide in their native language when they first arrive to help them adjust to working and living in Singapore. The guide educates them about their employment rights and responsibilities, as well as the consequences of not complying with our laws. It also provides practical advice to help them settle down, such as good hygiene practices, safe work practices and channels of assistance if they encounter problems. These messages are reinforced in MOM's newsletters and the roadshows for foreign workers that MOM conducts jointly with other agencies. MOM also appoints Foreign Worker Ambassadors who help provide advice to foreign workers staying in their dormitories.Member raised the issue of littering in dormitories. Dormitory operators are expected to maintain the cleanliness of their dormitory premises at all times. MOM regularly inspects dormitories, and will ask operators to make improvements if the living conditions are found to be unsatisfactory. Where the well-being of the workers is compromised as a result of poor dormitory conditions, MOM will take enforcement action against the errant operators. We urge anyone with information on specific dormitories that have serious littering issues to report these to MOM."
review of quantum of penalties and compensation for workplace incidents,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Manpower whether the quantum of penalties for workplace safety and health and quantum of compensation for work injuries will be reviewed to promote workplace safety.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: In 2006, the Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Act introduced a maximum penalty of $500,000 for failing to take reasonably practicable measures to ensure workers' health and safety. This was an increase from the $200,000 penalty under the old Factories Act1. MOM has been making strong representations to the State Courts, for penalties to be increased to reflect the severe consequences of failing to comply with the WSH Act. The penalties imposed by the State Courts have been increasing, with the highest fine to date being $220,000. MOM will continue to seek deterrent sentences in appropriate cases. There is therefore no need at this time, to consider further raising the maximum penalty under the WSH Act.The compensation limits for death, total permanent incapacity and medical expenses under the Work Injury Compensation Act was only just reviewed in 2015. From 1 January 2016, the compensation limits were increased by between 20% and 30%, in order to keep payouts in line with rising incomes and healthcare costs."
special dependant pass for foreign women with singapore citizen spouses or children,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether foreign spouses of Singapore citizens who are mothers of children who are Singapore citizens or pregnant with children who will be Singapore citizens should be issued a special dependant pass so that the mothers will not need to be interviewed by ICA officers at the checkpoints.,"Mr K Shanmugam: Our priority is to ensure the security of Singapore’s borders. All travellers, including Singapore citizens and Permanent Residents, are required to undergo security checks and screening at the checkpoints. Where necessary, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) may conduct further interviews and checks.There is no reason or justification from a security perspective to state that an entire category will be exempted from interviews – including foreign spouses of Singapore citizens. There is no blanket exemption even for Singaporeans – where necessary, ICA interviews Singaporeans.To pre-exempt any person or group from such checks and interviews will create a security gap. Once you announce to the world that a certain group will not be interviewed or checked, then you effectively announce to the terrorists which route can be exploited.We can be compassionate, but should not engage in practices which are innocent of the ways of terror.ICA facilitates the clearance of travellers with special needs, such as pregnant women or elderly persons, where necessary and practicable. This, however, has to be done without compromising security."
pilot programme to video record statements from suspects,Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is the status of the pilot programme for the police to video record statements from suspects; (b) what is the rate of submission of video recorded statements as evidence in trials; and (c) what are the plans to extend video recording of statements from suspects to all cases handled by the police and local law enforcement agencies.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The inter-agency workgroup on Video Recording of Interviews (VRI) has completed a round of consultations with the legal community, including the Law Society of Singapore and the Judiciary.MHA had previously announced that we will start a pilot of VRI in the first quarter of 2016. After taking into account the feedback received, we have decided that it would be better to first put in place the necessary legislative amendments before starting the VRI pilot. This was announced during the opening of the Criminal Law Conference on 14 July 2016. The legal framework will set out the procedures, admissibility and disclosure regime.We will announce details on the legislative amendments and the VRI pilot in due course."
publication of national output and income indicators of indigenous singaporeans,Mr Chen Show Mao asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Trade) why the Ministry has stopped publishing the indigenous GDP and GNI in the annual Yearbook of Statistics since 2013.,"Mr Lim Hng Kiang: The Department of Statistics (DOS) conducts regular reviews of the data series that it publishes, and may decide to stop the publication of those which are assessed to have low demand.In the case of the indigenous GDP and GNI series, DOS decided to stop publishing them with effect from the 2013 Yearbook of Statistics Singapore as there was a lack of public interest in the two series. In particular, there were no online downloads of the series nor specific queries on the series from the public in the years leading up to the decision to stop the publication of the series.Nonetheless, DOS has continued to compile the two series internally and will provide them to users on request."
police operationally-ready nsmen called up for active operational deployment,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is the percentage of Police Operationally-Ready NSmen called up for active operational deployment over the last three years; and (b) what are the efforts to re-design these NSmen's roles to enhance the police's capabilities.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The percentage of Police Operationally-Ready NSmen (ORNSmen) recalled in the last three years has steadily increased, from 76.9% in 2013, to 77.9% in 2014 and 81.4% in 2015. Police will call up as many as possible. Some of the reasons that the NSmen were not recalled include NSmen who were temporarily not deployable pending a review of their medical status, family emergencies or critical work commitments.Full-time National Servicemen (NSFs) and ORNSmen are an integral part of the SPF. In line with the recommendations of the Committee to Strengthen National Service, Police has been increasing the percentage of NS officers holding leadership and specialist roles. Police developed its NS Transformation Plan in 2014, to better train and deploy NSmen for greater operational effectiveness and offer a more meaningful NS experience. Under the Police NS Transformation Plan, the roles of NSmen in the following four areas were re-designed to enhance Police capabilitiesa) Community EngagementSPF has proactively re-deployed NSFs and NSmen into frontline Community Engagement (CE) roles since May 2016. As CE officers, they undertake duties as part of the NPC Community Policing Units. They undergo training that focuses on essential emergency preparedness knowledge, crowd management and evacuation skills. They reach out to members of the public to raise awareness on crime prevention and counter-terrorism. The NSFs will perform the same roles back in the same unit when they return as NSmen.b) Protective Security CommandThe Protective Security Command (ProCom) was commissioned as a new Police line unit in July 2016. ProCom will comprise the largest group of Police NSFs and NSmen. ProCom officers will be trained and deployed to protect key installations in peacetime and national emergency. They will also be responsible for event security at key national events.c) Police Land DivisionsSince August 2016, NSmen in the Neighbourhood Police Centres have been re-organised and centralised at the Police Land Division HQs as the Division Special Task Force (DSTF). DSTF NSmen will be recalled and deployed in sections or troops to enhance camaraderie, as well as command and control. DSTFs will project greater police presence in the heartlands and crime-prone areas.d) Special Operations CommandPolice NS Public Order Troops will be established in the Special Operations Command (SOC) by 2018. These troops will have public order capabilities similar to the Police Tactical Troops (PTTs) comprising regular officers. The NS Public Order Troops will bolster SPF's public order capabilities. These troops can also be deployed for anti-crime patrols or for major events with public order concerns.SPF's priority in the next few years is to implement the Police NS Transformation Plan well. Police NS officers can look forward to meaningful roles, more training and development opportunities, new concepts in operations and the application of advanced technology."
foreigners married to singapore citizens and their success in pr applications,"Mr Kok Heng Leun asked the Minister for Home Affairs in each year since 2009 (a) what is the number of foreigners married to Singapore citizens who have been (i) successful and (ii) unsuccessful in their PR applications respectively in that year; and (b) what is the breakdown of these numbers by household income, gender, and number of citizen children.","Mr K Shanmugam: Foreign spouses married to Singapore Citizens (SCs) may be granted Permanent Residence (PR) under the Family Ties Scheme (FTS). Each application is evaluated on a range of criteria, which include an assessment of the ability of the SC sponsor to support the family, the length of marriage and whether the couple have any children from the marriage.From 2009 to 2015, on average about 4,000 such PR applications were approved each year and about an equal number were rejected each year.Foreign spouses who do not qualify for PR yet may be granted a Long-Term Visit Pass (LTVP) for them to remain in Singapore with their families. Those who are granted LTVP are allowed to seek employment to help support their families. Over time, the foreign spouse can qualify for a Long-Term Visit Pass Plus (LTVP+) if the marriage proves stable, or if there are SC children from the marriage. The LTVP+ provides the foreign spouse with longer periods of residency and subsidies for inpatient services in public hospitals.The profile of foreign spouses of SC who were granted PR from 2009 to 2015 is as followsa) Household Income.Around 45% had a monthly household income of less than $4,000, which is around the 25th percentile of monthly incomes across all resident households in 2015.b) Gender.Around 81% were female.c) Number of SC children.At the point of application, around 28% of them had children. Of them, around 86% had SC children."
singaporeans under 21 years of age residing in singapore with a non-pr foreign parent,"Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) how many Singaporeans who are under 21 years of age reside in Singapore currently with a foreign parent who has not been given PR status; and (b) over the last five years, how many of these non-PR foreign parents are (i) women (ii) sole supporters of their Singaporean child, having been separated, divorced or widowed from their citizen spouse and (iii) persons who have left Singapore with their Singaporean child to reside elsewhere following the expiry of their Long-Term Visit Pass or other visit passes.","Mr K Shanmugam: As at 30 June 2016, about 10,000 Singapore Citizen (SC) children under the age of 21 had foreign parents who were residing in Singapore on either a Long-Term Visit Pass (LTVP) or a Work Pass.Based on ICA's records from 2012 to 2015, there were around 14,000 unique non-PR foreign parents with SC children under the age of 21 who applied for LTVPs. We do not have the 2011 data on hand because the reports were in hardcopies and did not allow us to perform the analysis needed to extract this data.Of these 14,000 parents, around 13,000 of them were female. Among this group, only 1% or 148 of them were widowed, divorced or separated. Only three did not eventually qualify for long-term stay through an immigration or employment facility. As at 31 August 2016, the SC children of these three were still residing in Singapore."
statistics on patients defaulting on medical bills,"Mr Chen Show Mao asked the Minister for Health (a) from 2010 to 2015, how many cases of patients defaulting on medical bills in local hospitals have there been each year; (b) of these defaulters, how many are Singapore citizens or permanent residents and how many are others; and (c) what is the current total amount of debt owed by such category of defaulters respectively.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: The majority of the patients (about 95%) in public hospitals settle their hospital bills within two months of discharge. This has remained similar over the last six years.Among patients with arrears outstanding for more than two months, Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents account for about 86%. The average amount owed was around $350.The equivalent figure for foreign patients was $1,400. The arrears of foreigner patients are typically larger because these patients do not receive government subsidies at our public hospitals.These arrears may eventually be paid up over time. They also include patients who are currently paying their outstanding bills by instalment, or are under assessment for financial assistance by the hospitals."
total debt-service radio as percentage of income for singapore resident households,"Mr Chen Show Mao asked the Prime Minister in each year from 2010 to 2015, what is the total debt-service ratio as a percentage of income for the median, 20th percentile and 90th percentile Singapore resident household.","Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): The debt servicing ratios7 of Singapore resident households have improved since the introduction of the Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR) framework in June 2013. In particular, the debt servicing ratio for the 20th income percentile household has fallen to 17% in 2015, from 22% in 2013 (Table 1). The debt servicing ratios for the median and 90th income percentile households have also edged down slightly to 34% and 44% respectively in 2015, from 35% and 46% respectively in 2013.MAS has taken a series of measures in recent years to encourage financial prudence among Singapore households. Measures like the TDSR and loan-to-value ratios aim to help borrowers avoid taking on excessive leverage for their property purchases. MAS has also introduced regulations on unsecured credit to help individuals with credit problems avoid accumulating further debt.These measures have helped to moderate the annual growth in household debt to 2.5% in Q2 2016, down from about 7.4% over the last five years. Since the introduction of the industry wide borrowing limit on unsecured credit in June 2015, the number of borrowers with outstanding unsecured debt exceeding 24 times their monthly income has more than halved, to less than 1% of all unsecured credit borrowers.MAS will continue to monitor debt-servicing ratios and household leverage and promote responsible borrowing."
employees benefitting from revision of employment assistance payment (eap),"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Manpower (a) since the last revision of the Employment Assistance Payment (EAP), how many employees have benefitted from this policy; and (b) what is the Ministry doing to solve the problem of employers dismissing or refusing to employ workers nearing age 62 in order to avoid paying EAP.","Mr Lim Swee Say: Under our current re-employment system, employers must offer re-employment to eligible employees who turn 62, and have worked in the company for at least three years. In doing so, employers should consider all available re-employment options within their organisation. This can include continuing on the same contract, or changing the job scope or work arrangements subject to mutual agreement with the employee. Our annual surveys suggest that over 98% of local employees who wished to continue working were offered employment beyond 62 since the re-employment legislation came into effect in 2012.Where the business situation genuinely does not allow the employer to offer re-employment, then, after having exhausted all other options, the employer is required to offer the affected employees a one-off Employment Assistance Payment, or EAP. This EAP is to help tide the employee over while he or she looks for employment or undergoes training. This should truly be a measure of last resort.We would like to remind employers that it is unlawful to dismiss an employee under 62 on the grounds of age. After 62, employers are required under the law to offer re-employment to eligible employees up to age 65 (and 67 from 1 July 2017) or EAP if they are unable to offer re-employment. Failure to do so would constitute an offence. Workers who feel that they have been unfairly dismissed should come to the Ministry of Manpower for advice and assistance.We also urge employers to not use age as a factor at all when hiring workers. Older workers can contribute their skills and experience to the company and should be valued especially given our slowing workforce growth. The tripartite partners are strongly committed to enable older workers who are willing and able to work to continue working for as long as possible. We also support employers to re-design jobs to become more age-friendly. We recently enhanced the WorkPro scheme to help companies make work easier, safer and smarter for older workers. We also recently extended the Special Employment Credit to encourage the employment of workers above 55.We hope that employers will tap on the flexibilities and support available to them to continue to benefit from the skills and experience of older employees, especially in a tight labour market."
safe sharing of footpaths by pedestrians and cyclists,Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for Transport (a) how can pedestrians be assured of personal safety when sharing footpaths with cyclists; and (b) how can the Government ensure that cyclists comply with the code of conduct so that everyone benefits from a shared use of the roads and footpaths.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The Government will be introducing new rules and a code of conduct for cycling and use of personal mobility devices, which will help to ensure the safety of both pedestrians and cyclists when sharing footpaths. The new rules will, amongst others, impose a speed limit of 15km/h for bicycles on footpaths, and disallow electric bicycles on the paths. The code of conduct will require cyclists to give way to pedestrians, and slow down and be prepared to stop when approaching crowded areas.We will promote adherence to the rules and code of conduct through enforcement and education. A dedicated team of Active Mobility Enforcement officers from LTA will patrol areas with high pedestrian and cyclist traffic and high incidence of complaints. They will be supported by Active Mobility Patrol teams, which comprise volunteers from the community and grassroots. They will educate cyclists about the new rules and code of conduct and encourage safe and gracious cycling behaviour. In fact, these enforcement officers and volunteers are already on the ground advising cyclists, even though the rules have not yet been passed into law.However, we cannot rely just on enforcement. A more sustainable solution is for Singaporeans to develop a harmonious and gracious culture, and to be considerate towards each other when sharing paths and roads. Thus, LTA launched the Safe Riders Campaign in April this year, and will be publicising the new rules and code of conduct through a nationwide education campaign in the coming months."
locations where cycling is restricted or prohibited,"Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for Transport (a) what are the restrictions or locations (for example expressways, tunnels and major roads) whereby cycling is prohibited, (b) what is the number of cases where cyclists are found to have violated such rules in the past one year; and (c) whether there are efforts planned to advise and educate cyclists on safe cycling habits and to highlight the restrictions.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Cycling is prohibited on expressways and on specific roads where there are safety concerns, such as the Fort Canning Road tunnel. At these roads, there are signs that show that cycling is prohibited there. From June 2015 to June this year, 29 summonses were issued for violation of these rules.The Land Transport Authority (LTA) works with the National Parks Board, Traffic Police, Town Councils, Grassroots Organisations and the Safe Cycling Task Force to educate cyclists about safety. Our initiatives include safety and etiquette workshops at Community Centres and Residents' Committee centres, training volunteers to serve as safety ambassadors in cycling towns, briefings for foreign workers about traffic rules, and Safe Cycling Clinics for secondary school students. In addition, LTA will launch the Safe Cycling Programme at the end of this year to educate the general public about safe cycling practices, proper use of cycling infrastructure and the proposed new rules and code of conduct for cyclists."
"criteria used in determining location, nature and length of mrt noise barriers","Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the criteria used to determine the location, nature and length of MRT noise barriers; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider extending the noise barriers in areas that are close to residential units where current sound barriers do not extend to the whole residential area.",Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The Land Transport Authority (LTA) gives priority to the installation of noise barriers along elevated MRT tracks where the noise level in adjacent residential developments due to the MRT exceeds NEA's recommended threshold criterion of 67 decibels (averaged over an hour).
meetings of presidential council for minority rights,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Prime Minister from 2012 to 2016 (a) how many meetings of the Presidential Council for Minority Rights have been held each year; (b) what is the duration of each meeting; and (c) how many of the Council members attended each meeting.,Mr Lee Hsien Loong: The Presidential Council for Minority Rights held a total of 31 meetings between August 2012 and July 2016. All meetings of the Council have been conducted with sufficient quorum of at least eight members including the Chairman. The duration of each meeting varied depending on the number of Bills being considered by the Council.
police operationally-ready nsmen called up for active operational deployment,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is the percentage of Police Operationally-Ready NSmen called up for active operational deployment over the last three years; and (b) what are the efforts to re-design these NSmen's roles to enhance the police's capabilities.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The percentage of Police Operationally-Ready NSmen (ORNSmen) recalled in the last three years has steadily increased, from 76.9% in 2013, to 77.9% in 2014 and 81.4% in 2015. Police will call up as many as possible. Some of the reasons that the NSmen were not recalled include NSmen who were temporarily not deployable pending a review of their medical status, family emergencies or critical work commitments.Full-time National Servicemen (NSFs) and ORNSmen are an integral part of the SPF. In line with the recommendations of the Committee to Strengthen National Service, Police has been increasing the percentage of NS officers holding leadership and specialist roles. Police developed its NS Transformation Plan in 2014, to better train and deploy NSmen for greater operational effectiveness and offer a more meaningful NS experience. Under the Police NS Transformation Plan, the roles of NSmen in the following four areas were re-designed to enhance Police capabilitiesa) Community EngagementSPF has proactively re-deployed NSFs and NSmen into frontline Community Engagement (CE) roles since May 2016. As CE officers, they undertake duties as part of the NPC Community Policing Units. They undergo training that focuses on essential emergency preparedness knowledge, crowd management and evacuation skills. They reach out to members of the public to raise awareness on crime prevention and counter-terrorism. The NSFs will perform the same roles back in the same unit when they return as NSmen.b) Protective Security CommandThe Protective Security Command (ProCom) was commissioned as a new Police line unit in July 2016. ProCom will comprise the largest group of Police NSFs and NSmen. ProCom officers will be trained and deployed to protect key installations in peacetime and national emergency. They will also be responsible for event security at key national events.c) Police Land DivisionsSince August 2016, NSmen in the Neighbourhood Police Centres have been re-organised and centralised at the Police Land Division HQs as the Division Special Task Force (DSTF). DSTF NSmen will be recalled and deployed in sections or troops to enhance camaraderie, as well as command and control. DSTFs will project greater police presence in the heartlands and crime-prone areas.d) Special Operations CommandPolice NS Public Order Troops will be established in the Special Operations Command (SOC) by 2018. These troops will have public order capabilities similar to the Police Tactical Troops (PTTs) comprising regular officers. The NS Public Order Troops will bolster SPF's public order capabilities. These troops can also be deployed for anti-crime patrols or for major events with public order concerns.SPF's priority in the next few years is to implement the Police NS Transformation Plan well. Police NS officers can look forward to meaningful roles, more training and development opportunities, new concepts in operations and the application of advanced technology."
foreigners married to singapore citizens and their success in pr applications,"Mr Kok Heng Leun asked the Minister for Home Affairs in each year since 2009 (a) what is the number of foreigners married to Singapore citizens who have been (i) successful and (ii) unsuccessful in their PR applications respectively in that year; and (b) what is the breakdown of these numbers by household income, gender, and number of citizen children.","Mr K Shanmugam: Foreign spouses married to Singapore Citizens (SCs) may be granted Permanent Residence (PR) under the Family Ties Scheme (FTS). Each application is evaluated on a range of criteria, which include an assessment of the ability of the SC sponsor to support the family, the length of marriage and whether the couple have any children from the marriage.From 2009 to 2015, on average about 4,000 such PR applications were approved each year and about an equal number were rejected each year.Foreign spouses who do not qualify for PR yet may be granted a Long-Term Visit Pass (LTVP) for them to remain in Singapore with their families. Those who are granted LTVP are allowed to seek employment to help support their families. Over time, the foreign spouse can qualify for a Long-Term Visit Pass Plus (LTVP+) if the marriage proves stable, or if there are SC children from the marriage. The LTVP+ provides the foreign spouse with longer periods of residency and subsidies for inpatient services in public hospitals.The profile of foreign spouses of SC who were granted PR from 2009 to 2015 is as followsa) Household Income.Around 45% had a monthly household income of less than $4,000, which is around the 25th percentile of monthly incomes across all resident households in 2015.b) Gender.Around 81% were female.c) Number of SC children.At the point of application, around 28% of them had children. Of them, around 86% had SC children."
monies paid by pilgrims to general sales agents for pilgrimage package,"Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (a) whether MUIS and the Association of Muslim Travel Agents (AMTAS) receive a portion of the monies paid by pilgrims to their respective general sales agents for the pilgrimage package; and (b) if so, whether pilgrims are informed of this and what is the total amount collected and its proportion in relation to the total sum received in the last three years.","Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim: The Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS) sends a Haj Mission to provide medical and welfare services to Singaporean pilgrims in the Muslim Holy Lands every year. The provision of these services, which include the setting up of medical clinics and the purchase of medicines, is critical for the safety, health and general well-being of our pilgrims.MUIS collects a fee of $300 per pilgrim to help recover the costs of its Haj Mission operations. The payment is included and reflected as 'Medical and Administrative Cost' in the haj package price paid by pilgrims to their respective General Sales Agents. This fee typically comprises a small proportion of the total haj package whose costs range from about $7,000 to $18,000.This fee, on its own, does not fully cover MUIS's costs for medical and welfare services, which has been about $700 per pilgrim in the last three years."
risk assessment and mitigation measures on china's planned floating nuclear power plant in south china sea,Mr Low Thia Khiang asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether the Ministry has done a risk assessment and planned for mitigation measures in relation to China's planned floating nuclear power plant which may be deployed in the South China Sea.,"Dr Vivian Balakrishnan: Mr Low asked whether the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has done a risk assessment and planned for mitigation measures in relation to China's planned floating nuclear power plants which may be deployed in the South China Sea.We are unaware of any official announcements by the Chinese government of specific plans to deploy floating nuclear power plants in the South China Sea, although there have been some media reports on this.As a member of the International Atomic Energy Agency and a party to various nuclear-related international legal instruments, and the United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), China would be aware of its obligations pertaining to the safety and security of its nuclear-related activities, and its responsibilities to protect the general public as well as the marine environment."
drug traffickers arrested in singapore from 2009 to 2015,"Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Home Affairs from 2009 to 2015, what is the number of drug traffickers arrested in Singapore each year.","Mr K Shanmugam: We do not release data on the number of traffickers arrested in Singapore due to operational security reasons.However, we can share that there was a dip in the number of drug traffickers arrested in 2010 and 2011, as compared to the preceding years. The numbers have gone up since 2011, but remained below the 2009 figure.Several factors could have contributed to the increase in the number of traffickers arrested since 2011. These include a worsening regional drug situation, local demand for drugs such as methamphetamine and cannabis, and stepped up enforcement efforts by the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB)."
interest payment on cpf amount owed to members under full savings vesting (fsv) bonus scheme,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Defence whether the Ministry will include the payment of interest that could have been earned on the CPF amount owed to members under the Full Savings Vesting (FSV) Bonus scheme that has been highlighted in the Auditor-General's Report for FY2015/16.,"Dr Ng Eng Hen: MINDEF is working with the CPF Board to credit the CPF amount payable to servicemen who had received the Full Savings Vesting Bonus. In accordance with the CPF guidelines, the total amount credited will include the interest that could have been earned if the CPF contributions had been made at the time of the FSVB payment."
drug traffickers arrested in singapore through certificate of cooperation framework,"Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Home Affairs to date, what is the number of drug traffickers arrested in Singapore as a result of investigative leads yielded through the certificate of co-operation framework that was brought into force by amendments to the Misuse of Drugs Act in 2012.","Mr K Shanmugam: Since the amendments to the Misuse of Drugs Act in 2012, information provided by drug couriers have contributed to the arrest of more than 80 drug traffickers."
case-by-case review for driving instructors reaching 70 years of age,"Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether there can be a case by case review for driving instructors, who upon reaching the age of 70 years, remain fit, well and are able to continue to be Instructors.",Mr K Shanmugam: Traffic Police is currently reviewing the upper age limit for driving instructors. We will announce the outcome of the review when it is completed.
statistics on citizen children born to pr mothers and foreign mothers without pr,"Mr Kok Heng Leun asked the Minister for Home Affairs in each year since 2009, how many citizen children have been born to (i) PR mothers and (ii) foreign mothers without PR respectively.","Mr K Shanmugam: From 2009 to 2015, an average of around 4,600 citizen children were born in Singapore each year to mothers who were Permanent Residents (PRs). For the same period, an average of around 2,200 citizen children were born to foreign mothers who were not PRs."
update on delayed construction of singapore's first co-digestion plant at pub's ulu pandan water reclamation plant,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether he can provide an update on the delayed construction of Singapore's first co-digestion plant at PUB's Ulu Pandan Water Reclamation Plant; (b) whether fraud is involved in the delayed construction; and (c) what assistance will be provided to the affected SMEs involved in this project.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The purpose of the co-digestion demonstration project at the Ulu Pandan Water Reclamation Plant is to test a new technology developed and owned by Anaergia Inc, a leading international renewable energy company. The technology involves co-digesting food waste and used water sludge, thus increasing biogas production and reducing the net energy consumption of used water treatment. The project required Anaergia Inc to set up and operate the demonstration plant over three years under the TechPioneer Scheme, which is co-funded by PUB and EDB and supported by the National Research Foundation (NRF). This scheme promotes the early adoption and commercialisation of new environmental and water technologies.The co-digestion project had started well in November 2014. However, in October 2015, PUB discovered that the local company representing Anaergia Inc, Anaergia Pte Ltd (or APL), was unable to meet the project schedule. PUB had also been in close contact with the Canada-based Anaergia Inc, who was committed to resolving the issue. The parent company decided to appoint its other Singapore subsidiary, Anaergia Singapore Pte Ltd (ASPL), to steer the project back on track. PUB had agreed to the change as the plant under construction is designed to use Anaergia Inc's proprietary co-digestion technology.After the ASPL took over the project, construction of the demonstration plant resumed in June 2016. The plant is now about 70% completed, and is on schedule for completion by December 2016.For all R&D projects co-funded by PUB, PUB only makes payments to the main contractor for the actual expenses incurred, after receipt of the invoice and on-site verification that the work had been satisfactorily completed. PUB was prompt in making payments to APL for this co-digestion project.PUB does not directly contract with or reimburse the sub-contractors for all its projects. For this particular co-digestion project, the sub-contractors had informed PUB earlier this year that APL had not paid them for the work done. PUB took action and advised the sub-contractors to seek legal redress and exercise their contractual rights against APL. We understand that the two subcontractors who took APL to court were awarded court judgments in May 2016 against APL for the amounts owed. We are unable to comment on whether fraud is involved in the delay in construction by APL."
anti-slip treatment for bathroom tiles under enhancement for active seniors (ease) programme,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for National Development with regard to the anti-slip treatment for bathroom tiles subsidised under HDB's Enhancement for Active Seniors (EASE) programme (a) how many households have benefitted from the treatment to date; (b) what is the total cost to the Government for subsidising the treatment; (c) what is the average life span of the treatment before a new treatment is required; and (d) how has HDB responded to complaints about the treatment, if any.","Mr Lawrence Wong: The Enhancement for Active Seniors (EASE) programme aims to make homes safer for the elderly. Eligible residents can select from three improvement items, comprising ramps to overcome single-step entrances, grab bars, and slip-resistant treatment to floor tiles for up to two toilets.Specifically for the slip-resistant treatment to floor tiles of toilets, about 70,000 households have benefitted since the launch of EASE in July 2012. The Government has spent more than $10 million subsidising slip-resistant treatment to floor tiles.Such treated floor tiles can typically last up to five years. However, the life span will also depend on the usage and frequency of cleaning. For example, the accumulation of excessive dirt or soap residue might reduce the effectiveness of the slip-resistant treatment.HDB will investigate the feedback and complaints received on slip-resistant treatment of tiles. In cases where the slip-resistance has deteriorated due to accumulation of dirt or soap residue, residents will be advised on the appropriate methods of cleaning the tiles to upkeep the slip-resistant treatment. If the slip-resistance has pre-maturely deteriorated within the 1-year Defects Liability Period despite proper cleaning, HDB will request its contractors to rectify the situation."
provision of anti-harassment training to staff in tertiary institutions,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) in light of the need to cultivate a safe and harassment-free environment in tertiary institutions, whether the Ministry will consider (i) providing anti-harassment training to staff in tertiary institutions similar to the recommendation of the Tripartite Advisory on Managing Workplace Harassment and (ii) adapting the Advisory to formulate guidelines for tertiary institutions on student-student interactions.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: The Tripartite Advisory on Managing Workplace Harassment issued in December 2015 encourages all employers to adopt measures that ensure a safe and conducive workplace. Specifically, the Advisory proposes that employers develop a harassment prevention policy, provide information and training on workplace harassment, and implement reporting and response procedures.Our tertiary institutions agree with the principles and core values articulated in the Advisory.All our tertiary institutions have harassment prevention policies and guidelines within their own institution-specific Codes of Conduct for staff and students. In addition, institutions have in place guidelines to govern staff-student relationships. These policies and guidelines are explained to staff and students during staff inductions, student dialogue sessions and other internal events.When harassment incidents occur, there are various reporting channels available to persons who are affected. For instance, students can report incidents to their teacher-mentors. Some institutions such as the Institute of Technical Education also have a hotline for victims to report the incidents.Our institutions will continue to adopt best practices from the Advisory to improve their HR policies, training and communications so that they can maintain a safe and harassment-free work and learning environment for staff and students."
rationale for administrative fee for temporary extension of stay for sellers of resale hdb flats,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for National Development (a) why does HDB charge an administrative fee for the temporary extension of stay for sellers of resale flats when this is a private agreement; (b) what recourse do sellers have when buyers suddenly terminate the extension and leave them temporarily homeless; and (c) why the private agreement cannot be made a regulated agreement as part of the resale contract.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Typically, flat sellers are required to move out on the legal completion date of the resale transaction. However, HDB allows them to seek a temporary extension of stay for up to three months, subject to the buyer’s agreement. This is to facilitate the sellers' transit to their next home. HDB charges an administrative fee of $20 to cover expenses in processing the request.The flat buyers and sellers are advised to discuss all aspects of the extension and come to a mutual agreement before proceeding with the application. As this is a private agreement between the two parties, they may seek their own legal advice on the matter should any dispute arise. Sellers are not expected to be left homeless in case of a dispute, as they should have already bought another property that is ready for occupation.The resale contract and the private extension of stay agreement are separate arrangements. Not all flat sellers would require an extension of stay after the sale of their flats, and similarly, not all flat buyers are able to accommodate such a request. Hence, it is not practical to make the temporary extension of stay as part of the resale contract."
statistics on teachers not renewing teaching contracts and on no-pay leave,"Mr Chen Show Mao asked the Acting Minister for Education (Schools) in each year from 2010 to 2015 (a) how many teachers chose not to renew their teaching contracts with the Ministry; (b) how many teachers were on no-pay leave; and (c) of those on no-pay leave, what was the average duration that they were away from the teaching service.","Mr Ng Chee Meng: Education officers are generally appointed on permanent service rather than on contract service. As such, if they do leave, it is through resignation and not because of the non-renewal of contracts. The annual resignation rate for education officers has remained low at around 3% over the past few years.The percentage of education officers on no-pay leave8 has been about 2% in the past few years. The average duration of no-pay leave for officers who returned from no-pay leave in the past few years has been about two years."
reasons given by teachers for quitting teaching service or not renewing contracts,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Acting Minister for Education (Schools) what are the top three reasons given by teachers who (i) quit the teaching service (ii) choose not to renew their teaching contracts and (iii) take no-pay leave respectively.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: Education officers are generally appointed on permanent service and not on contract service. As such, if they do leave, it is through resignation and not because of the non-renewal of contracts. The top three reasons for resignation cited by officers are for childcare, other family considerations and a desire for a change of job.The top two reasons for officers taking no-pay leave are for childcare and the accompanying of spouse who is going overseas. The third common reason is to attend to other private matters, but this makes up a small number."
installation of subsidised mosquito screens for lower-income households,Ms Joan Pereira asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry will consider subsidising the installation of mosquito screens for lower-income households as a form of protection against dengue and Zika.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB does not currently have plans to subsidise the installation of mosquito screens. Vector control remains the key strategy in reducing the spread of dengue and Zika. NEA and PA also conduct outreach activities in dengue and Zika clusters to alert residents and advise them to take precautionary measures such as applying insect repellent and wearing long-sleeved clothing. Residents are encouraged to stay vigilant, and do their part to prevent mosquito breeding in their homes by following the 5-step Mozzie Wipeout."
restrictions on political activity and discussion at yale-nus college,Mr Chen Show Mao asked the Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (a) what are the restrictions on political activity and discussion at Yale-NUS College; and (b) how do these compare with the six publicly-funded universities in Singapore.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: Political issues are commonly discussed as part of academic programmes, research and extra-curricular activities at publicly-funded universities. This helps students develop balanced perspectives and critical thinking.However, as universities should be neutral places for learning, they generally do not allow activities that will result in them being used as platforms to advance sectarian or partisan political interests.The same applies to Yale-NUS College."
infrastructure projects planned since inception of asian infrastructure investment bank,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Finance (a) since the inception of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, are there any infrastructure projects being planned; (b) what can local companies do to tap on the benefits that come with Singapore's membership; and (c) how will Singapore's economy benefit from this involvement in the long term.","Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam: Since its establishment on 25 December 2015, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) has been focusing on recruiting staff, putting in place financial and operational policies and developing a strong project pipeline.The AIIB has achieved some early success. The AIIB Board of Directors recently approved in June for the Bank to finance the first four projects worth over US$500 million. Three of the four projects will be co-financed with other multilateral development banks, namely the Asian Development Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the World Bank. These include (i) a motorway in Pakistan; (ii) a highway in Tajikistan, and (iii) a slum upgrading project in Indonesia. The fourth, financed entirely by the AIIB, involves a power distribution system in Bangladesh.More projects are being considered, with the AIIB targeting to lend up to US$1.2 billion to finance five to ten projects in 2016; and double that in 2017. Over the medium term, the AIIB will also look to crowd-in funding from the private sector. This will contribute additional market expertise and financial discipline to the managing of future infrastructure projects.The AIIB is an important addition to the international financial architecture. Singapore has long-standing cooperation with other multilateral development banks like the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. Joining the AIIB further complements Singapore’s role as an international financial centre and an urban development hub for the region.Asia’s infrastructure needs are large and growing. Our companies can seek partnership opportunities with the AIIB by bidding for infrastructure projects, or providing advisory services such as project structuring and urban planning.By investing in much-needed infrastructure in Asia, the AIIB plays an important role in helping to increase the economic competitiveness and vibrancy of the region. An economically vibrant region, with greater trade, investment and business opportunities, will benefit Singapore as well as the companies based here."
abuse of criteria for approval of ep applications,Mr Zaqy Mohamad asked the Minister for Manpower with regard to the case where an employee of Harry's International Pte Ltd was caught with falsely declaring information on hiring 20 employment pass (EP) holders (a) what are the criteria which the company met to get approval for 20 EP applications; and (b) what safeguards are in place to ensure that lack of quota for EP holders in the firm is not abused.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: Employment Pass (EP) applications are assessed based on a combination of factors including educational qualifications, work experience and salary. The 20 EP applications for Harry’s International Pte Ltd were approved as they met criteria. However, their employee was subsequently found to have falsely declared the salaries in the EP applications. She was convicted in court and fined $40,000.MOM safeguards the integrity of our work pass framework by conducting the necessary verification on doubtful EP applications. These include checks on qualifications by overseas screening agencies or with the issuing education institutions. Employers may also be asked to show proof that the submitted qualifications are genuine, and that they have the financial ability to pay the declared salaries. Audits may be conducted to ascertain if EP holders were indeed paid the salaries as declared.EP applications found with doubtful qualifications will be rejected. EP applicants found to have submitted forged qualifications will also be barred from employment in Singapore. Applications with a declared salary suspected to have been inflated will also be rejected.Strong action is taken against those who make false declarations in work pass applications. If convicted, the offender can be fined up to $20,000 and/or jailed for up to two years under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (EFMA). They will also be barred from hiring new or renewing work passes of their foreign workers. Members of the public who know of such offences should report the matter to MOM. Since 2014, a total of 58 employers have been convicted for making false declarations of salary in work pass applications.While there is no EP quota, employers must consider Singaporeans fairly in hiring and career development. MOM subjects EP applications from companies which have signs of unfair employment practices to closer scrutiny. Processing of their EP applications will take longer. Where such companies do not take corrective action, MOM may on the recommendation of Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment Practices (TAFEP), suspend their work pass privileges."
review of yearly cap on use of medisave,Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry will review the yearly cap on the use of Medisave in line with inflation of medication costs and increases in treatment costs for common chronic diseases such that 90% of costs can be met with Medisave.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Under the Chronic Disease Management Programme (CDMP), Singaporeans can use up to $400 per Medisave account per year to pay for their chronic disease treatment. 19 chronic conditions are covered under CDMP, which accounts for more than 90% of chronic attendances seen at polyclinics today.In 2015, the $400 CDMP limit was fully sufficient for 9 in 10 subsidised patients with common chronic conditions. This was higher than 8 in 10 in 2014, and was due to the full effect of outpatient subsidy enhancements for lower and middle-income Singaporeans and the Pioneer Generation Package in 2015.Patients whose medical bills for chronic conditions exceed the $400 cap can also use the Medisave of their family members to pay, or apply for Medifund at the polyclinics or subsidised specialist outpatient clinics in public hospitals if they face financial difficulties.MOH will continue to monitor the affordability of subsidised care, especially for chronic diseases, and review the Medisave withdrawal limits regularly, while taking into consideration the need to ensure that Medisave balances are not depleted prematurely."
rationale for pricing of 2-room hdb flexi-flats on short lease,"Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for National Development with regard to the pricing of 2-room HDB flexi-flats on short lease, what is the rationale for setting a higher price for first-timer single, divorced or widowed applicants under the Single Singapore Citizen Scheme compared to those applying under other schemes.","Mr Lawrence Wong: We set aside the majority of our heavily subsidised new flats for the benefit of first-timer families with two or more persons. This includes two or more singles purchasing a 2-room Flexi flat under the Joint Singles Scheme (JSS). These singles, as well as divorced/widowed persons applying with their children, pay the same price as families.Singles, including divorced/widowed persons without children, buying a 2-room Flexi flat on their own under the Single Singapore Citizen (SSC) Scheme pay a price difference of $15,000 for a 99-year lease flat. For those aged 55 years and above who purchase a 2-room Flexi flat on short lease, the price difference is pro-rated based on the length of the lease. This ensures that limited housing subsidies are equitably distributed among homebuyers.Singles who subsequently marry a Singapore citizen or Singapore permanent resident can apply for the CPF Housing Top-Up Grant and enjoy the same subsidy as a family."
hdb blocks without fire engine access roads,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for National Development (a) how many HDB blocks are currently without fire engine access roads; (b) how does HDB ensure that all older blocks built in the 1980s or earlier are provided with fire engine access roads or acceptable alternatives; (c) whether there are guidelines that HDB must adhere to regarding the maintenance of such roads or alternatives; and (d) how does HDB ensure that regular and appropriate maintenance are carried out.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Over the years, HDB has enhanced the fire safety provisions for older blocks. As a result, all HDB blocks have either a fire engine access road, or access to a fire rising mains breeching inlet.As the access roads are part of the common property, Town Councils are to ensure that maintenance works are carried out in accordance with the Fire Code."
"median, mean, 10th and 90th percentile totals in deceased members' individual cpf accounts","Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Manpower from 2010 to 2015, what has been the median, mean, 10th percentile and 90th percentile total amount of money in individual CPF accounts when those individuals became deceased in each of those years.","Mr Lim Swee Say: Half of CPF members aged 65 or older who passed on in 2015 had about $6,800 or less left in their CPF accounts. Table 1 below shows the CPF balances of CPF members aged 65 or older who passed away between 2010 and 2015.Any unused CPF balances are bequeathed to the deceased member’s nominated beneficiaries. If there are no nominated beneficiaries, the unused CPF balances are distributed under intestacy laws."
resident workers offered re-employment contracts upon reaching retirement age,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Manpower (a) since 2011, how many resident workers have been offered re-employment contracts upon reaching retirement age; (b) of these, how many have received a reduction in wages and other remuneration despite having no change in job scope or responsibilities; (c) what has been the average reduction in wages and other remuneration; and (d) how does the Ministry ensure that employers do not unfairly reduce wages of workers reaching retirement age even though there is no change in their productivity and performance.","Mr Lim Swee Say: The re-employment model was introduced in 2012, after extensive tripartite consultations. Under the Retirement and Re-employment Act (RRA), employers are required to offer re-employment to eligible employees who turn 62 years old or the contractual retirement age if it is higher, up to the prevailing re-employment age. Employers may re-employ employees on a new contract with re-negotiated terms, or allow them to continue on their existing contracts. The law requires any adjustments to contract terms to be based on reasonable factors, such as the employees’ productivity, performance, duties and responsibilities and the wage system applicable to the employee, including any seniority element. Currently, the re-employment age is 65 years old and it will be raised to 67 years old by 1 July 2017 as announced at the Ministry of Manpower’s Committee of Supply debate in April.In recent years, over 98% of resident employees who wished to continue working were offered employment beyond 62. Specifically in 2015, 98% of those who accepted re-employment in the same job, be it on a new or existing contract did not experience a cut in their basic wages. Of the small minority of 2% who did experience wage cuts upon re-employment, the median wage cut was 10%. It is worth noting that among those on new contracts, almost one in ten actually received higher wages upon re-employment.To create higher awareness of employers’ obligations on the employment of older employees, the tripartite partners have issued a set of Tripartite Guidelines on the Re-employment of Older Employees. The guidelines are gazetted, and are used by the Ministry of Manpower, the Industrial Arbitration Court and the High Court in settling re-employment claims and appeals. Employees who feel that their wages have been unfairly adjusted upon re-employment should approach their unions or the Ministry of Manpower for early assistance."
studies and projections on commuter usage patterns of taxis and private hire cars,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the Ministry has carried out any studies as well as medium-to-long-term projections on the commuter usage patterns of taxis and private hire cars; (b) if so, whether these findings or projections can be shared with the public; and (c) if no such studies or projections have been made, whether the Ministry will conduct such studies or projections.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: In recent years, taxi ridership had grown by about 2% annually, based on data on taxi trips submitted by taxi companies. Land Transport Authority (LTA) also conducts the Taxi Customer Satisfaction Survey (TCSS) annually, which provides a good understanding of commuter usage patterns and satisfaction with different aspects of taxi services.These taxi demand trends may change given the growth in supply and popularity of competing services like those provided by Uber and Grab. However, our data on the chauffeured services industry is relatively scant and we do not yet have any projections for the industry, as chauffeured services’ popularity is a recent phenomenon. To complete the picture, we will be expanding the TCSS to include chauffeured services. We are also amending the Road Traffic Act to require chauffeured service providers to provide LTA with trip data. Taken together with the data we have of taxi services, LTA will then be able to more comprehensively study overall commuter patterns and make meaningful projections."
number of intra-company transferees from india approved under comprehensive economic cooperation agreement,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Manpower what is the number of intra-company transferees from India that have been approved under the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) with India from the year when the agreement came into effect to the latest year for which data is available.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: Intra-company transferees (ICTs) from any country, including India, would need to meet the Ministry’s work pass qualifying criteria to work in Singapore. The only difference is that ICTs from all countries are exempted from the advertisement requirement in our Jobs Bank. The Ministry does not disclose data on foreign manpower with breakdown by nationality, including data on ICTs."
scoring methodology used to determine civil servants' current estimated potential,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Prime Minister whether the Ministry will be able to (i) provide greater transparency on the scoring methodology used to determine a civil servant's Current Estimated Potential (CEP) as well as an officer's CEP score at a point in time and (ii) implement a 360-degree feedback appraisal system for civil servants which is currently common practice in the private sector.,"Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): The Civil Service uses Currently Estimated Potential (CEP) as one tool to plan for the career development of officers. CEP is expressed in terms of the highest job responsibility level an officer is currently assessed to be capable of handling in the future. Hence an officer’s CEP may change with assessment over time. CEP is assessed based on demonstrated ""AIM"" qualities, which stand for (1) Analytical and Intellectual Capacity; (2) Influence and Collaboration; and (3) Motivation for Excellence. After a supervisor assesses his officer for CEP, the assessment is subject to counter-signing and ranking processes at the Ministry level, to ensure that the assessment is robust and fair.All officers have access to information on the CEP assessment framework and definitions of the AIM qualities through Instruction Manuals, assessment guides, and training by the Civil Service College. Our agencies also encourage supervisors to have frank conversations with officers and help them along in their career development. We are placing emphasis on developing supervisors so that they are better prepared to coach their officers.The Civil Service encourages timely and regular feedback as part of the appraisal process. Today, leaders receive 360 degree feedback on their leadership qualities when they attend milestone leadership development programmes. The feedback helps them to understand their strengths, developmental areas and blind spots, and motivates them to improve. For other officers, the feedback loop is generally between officers and their supervisors through day to day interactions and work review sessions which culminate in the completion of their Individual Development Plans. The Civil Service is looking into ways to make ""giving timely feedback to one another"" a cultural norm."
breaches of cooling-off day regulations,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Prime Minister (a) since the introduction of Cooling-Off Day regulations, how many individuals have been investigated by the Elections Department for the publication of electoral advertising on the Internet for (i) the People's Action Party and (ii) other parties on Cooling-Off Day and Polling Day; (b) how does the Department come to be alerted to these individuals' publications; and (c) what are its priorities in selecting the individuals to be investigated.","Mr Chan Chun Sing (for the Prime Minister): The prohibition of election advertising on Cooling-Off Day and Polling Day allows voters time to step back from the excitement and emotion of campaigning, to reflect on the issues at stake before casting their votes. In assessing whether any breaches have occurred online, the Elections Department (ELD) takes into consideration the intent, reach and impact of the posts published, regardless for whom the posts are made.In the various elections since the Cooling-Off Day was introduced in 2011, right up to GE2015, the ELD had investigated more than 100 cases involving candidates and supporters from both the ruling and opposition parties for potential breaches of the election advertising law. The approach then was to give warnings in respect of these breaches. However, despite the fact that Cooling-Off Day had been publicised several times, the ELD observed what appeared to be deliberate and serious breaches of the law during the 2016 Bukit Batok By-Election. These posts were published in spite of the advisory that the ELD had issued prior to Cooling-Off Day and a subsequent reminder on Cooling-Off Day against such activities. Given the egregious nature of these breaches, the ELD reported them to the Police for further investigation.The ELD relies on different sources of information to identify potential breaches. For instance, the ELD monitors candidates’ declared campaigning sites as well as online platforms that regularly engage in discussion, propagation or promotion of political issues. The ELD will also look into feedback or complaints from candidates or members of the public."
minimum width of footpaths for safe use by pedestrians and cyclists,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Transport given that pedestrians have to share footpaths with cyclists (a) whether the Ministry will review the minimum width for all footpaths so that there is sufficient room for both pedestrians and cyclists to use them safely; and (b) when will the Ministry roll out a comprehensive policy to give clarity to the rules governing the use of bicycles, e-bikes, personal mobility devices, and the enforcement and penalties for offenders.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Our footpaths are generally about 1.5 to 1.8 metres wide, but can be as wide as 3.6 metres where there is high pedestrian traffic. New footpaths along roads will be at least 1.8 metres wide. For existing footpaths, we will widen them where we can.Footpaths can be found nearly everywhere. Allowing cyclists to share them with pedestrians is helpful as we promote and facilitate safe cycling. However, we clearly prefer dedicated cycling paths and will continue to expand the network of cycling paths in all our HDB towns. As we have said before, cyclists must be considerate and gracious on footpaths and always give way to pedestrians. This is for their safety and that of other path users.The Active Mobility Advisory Panel had released to the public its full report and recommendations in March this year. As announced at the Ministry’s Committee of Supply debate, the Government has accepted in full the Panel’s recommendations. We will need some time to put them into legislation. This should be done by the end of this year. In the meantime, LTA, together with Traffic Police, NParks and Town Councils, will be stepping up our enforcement and education efforts, including through posters and pamphlets."
measures to require banks to upgrade branch security protocols,Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Prime Minister what measures are being considered by MAS to require banks to upgrade their branch security protocols in light of the recent bank robbery incident at Holland Village on 7 July 2016.,"Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister): The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) expects banks to carry out thorough security threat assessments for all their branches and ensure that they have appropriate measures in place to mitigate security risks.Following the recent robbery, MAS and the Singapore Police Force (SPF) have reminded banks to conduct regular threat assessments and to enhance security measures where necessary. These measures include ensuring closed circuit television systems and panic alarms are in good working order, as well as deploying armed security personnel to safeguard premises that are assessed to be high-risk or vulnerable. In addition to adopting security measures, banks are reminded that in the event of a robbery, the safety of employees and customers are paramount and that bank staff should be properly trained to act in an appropriate manner and to call the police only when safe to do so.MAS is also collaborating with the SPF and the Association of Banks in Singapore on enhancing physical security best practices including drawing on learning points from this recent incident."
service standards for responding to calls via emergency call buttons on mrt trains,Mr Low Thia Khiang asked the Minister for Transport (a) what are the service standards for responding to calls made via the emergency call buttons on MRT trains; (b) what alternative action can commuters take to stop a moving train in cases that the station control cannot be reached during an emergency; and (c) how does LTA intend to enhance emergency procedures for commuters on MRT and LRT trains.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: There are several ways for commuters to raise an alert or stop the train in an emergency. First, they can contact the train captain, station staff or the Operations Control Centre (OCC) using the intercom units inside the trains and on station platforms. LRT passengers can also call the OCC using their mobile phones. The OCC contact numbers are displayed inside the LRT trains. Second, commuters can use the emergency stop buttons on station platforms, the intercom units inside MRT trains, and the ""Emergency Next Station Stop"" buttons inside Bukit Panjang LRT (BPLRT) trains, to bring the train to a safe stop.The train operators are required to ensure that these mechanisms function properly, and that train captains, and station and OCC staff respond in a timely manner. LTA and the operators review these safety facilities and procedures periodically. LTA is currently investigating the Bukit Panjang LRT incident."
building of additional mrt station between chua chu kang and bukit gombak mrt stations,Mr Zaqy Mohamad asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the Ministry will review the building of an additional MRT station between Chua Chu Kang and Bukit Gombak MRT stations to serve the large number of residents who will be moving into BTO units in Keat Hong and Chua Chu Kang Towns and the future Tengah Town; and (b) what are the technical and cost considerations in the Ministry's review on such a viability.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Ridership is a key consideration in deciding whether to build an additional MRT station. In this case, while there will be some increase in ridership with the new BTO units, it is still insufficient to support a new station for now. We will continue to monitor developments in the area and will reconsider our position if and when the ridership case becomes stronger.Meanwhile, to serve the additional residents in the area, three new bus services have been introduced under the Bus Service Enhancement Programme. This should be sufficient for now. We will further increase bus services and capacity as necessary."
making bus stops friendly to wheelchair accessible buses,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Transport (a) how many of the 169 bus stops that were inaccessible to Wheelchair Accessible Buses (WABs) in 2013 remain inaccessible today; (b) what are the criteria for bus stops to have priority conversion to being wheelchair-accessible; (c) whether consecutive bus stops along the same road are part of this criteria; and (d) when will all bus stops be converted to become WAB-accessible bus stops and whether there is a deadline for this.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: 137 bus stops are not yet wheelchair-accessible. This is less than 3% of our 4,700 bus stops. The site conditions of these bus stops make conversion challenging. For example, new footpaths may have to be built and major drains covered. In extremis, the entire bus stop and bus bay may have to be rebuilt.LTA is targeting to upgrade all these bus stops by 2020. The implementation schedule takes into consideration various factors including if consecutive bus stops along the same road are wheelchair inaccessible."

review of voting age,Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Prime Minister whether the Government will review the voting age.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing (for the Prime Minister): Our minimum voting age is set at 21 under Section 5 of the Parliamentary Elections Act. The reasons for keeping to this minimum voting age had been explained in this House before on more than one occasion. Let me state them again.Voting in elections is a very serious matter. Voters choose their Member of Parliament and in turn the group of individuals they will entrust to eventually form the government, or the President to exercise the custodial and veto powers set out in the Constitution. This is a choice that a voter needs to have the necessary maturity to make.These reasons for keeping the minimum voting age at 21 remain valid today, and we have no plans to review it."
reducing light pollution on streets and its impact on safety,Mr Seah Kian Peng asked the Minister for Transport whether LTA has plans to reduce light pollution on the streets and how will LTA balance the issue of lighting and its impact on safety given that Singapore is the most light-polluted country based on the latest issue of Science Advances Journal.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Street lighting in Singapore is provided in accordance with international standards for road safety. Reducing the level of lighting will endanger motorists and pedestrians. Light pollution is naturally highest in densely populated cities. Singapore is the only city-state included in the study, which could explain our high ranking."
effect of island-wide electric car sharing programme on coe quotas,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Transport whether the vehicles that are part of the island-wide electric car sharing programme will affect COE quotas.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: As the Electric Vehicles (EV) Car-Sharing Scheme is a trial to test EVs in fleet-based operations, the COEs used to register the EVs will not be drawn from the COE quota."
update on effectiveness of compulsory day off policy for foreign domestic workers,"Mr Kok Heng Leun asked the Minister for Manpower (a) if he can provide an update on the effectiveness of the compulsory day off policy for foreign domestic workers; and (b) for 2014 and 2015, what is the number of (i) foreign domestic workers who do not have a weekly day off (ii) foreign domestic workers who are not compensated if they do not have a weekly day off (iii) complaints which the Ministry has received about employers not granting rest days and (iv) complaints which the Ministry has received about employers not compensating foreign domestic workers in lieu of not taking their weekly day off.","Mr Lim Swee Say: The rest day policy introduced in 2013 requires employers to provide their Foreign Domestic Workers (FDWs) with a weekly rest day while giving employers the flexibility to compensate their FDWs with extra pay if the FDW agrees to work on her rest day. This arrangement is in recognition that some employers may have genuine difficulties giving FDWs weekly rest days and that some FDWs may prefer the option to work and earn more by forgoing their rest days.This policy has been making encouraging progress. Since its introduction, the vast majority of our FDWs have reported having rest days. In a 2015 survey of FDWs, it was found that 97.5%, or almost all, received at least one rest day every month, up from 53% in 2010. Furthermore, more than 55% received a weekly rest day in 2015, up from 13% in 2010.Complaints from FDWs to MOM regarding rest day arrangements and compensation-in-lieu of rest days are small in number. There were around 40 complaints received by MOM from 2014 to 2015, representing less than 0.02% of the FDW population. No rest day-related violations were found in these cases from MOM’s investigations. Our investigations showed that some of the FDWs wanted to change their rest day agreement with their employers while others were unsure if they had been paid rest day compensation. MOM resolved these cases after clarification with the respective FDWs and employers.To minimise misunderstandings, we have enhanced the In-Principle Approval letter sent out to all FDWs before they arrive in Singapore. This letter, in the FDW’s native language, details the FDW’s basic salary, the number of agreed rest days, and the compensation for each rest day foregone. The letter allows the FDW to be fully aware of her salary and rest day compensation before she decides to come to Singapore.It is important that FDWs are treated fairly. FDWs who need assistance on issues relating to rest days can approach MOM through our MOM FDW hotline."
mda's due diligence and oversight processes in provision of financial support,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) what due diligence and oversight processes have been exercised by MDA prior to it providing financial support to RGM Entertainment and RGM Group in 2010 and 2011; (b) what lapses occurred in MDA's due diligence and oversight processes in this case, if any; and (c) what measures has MDA since taken to strengthen its due diligence and oversight mechanisms in making such awards.","Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim: In 2010 and 2011, MDA invested $15 million in RGM Entertainment and RGM Group to position Singapore as a media financing and production hub.Before proceeding with the investments, MDA checked RGM’s track record, assessed the projected returns, and examined the backgrounds of other co-investment partners.However, in 2011, MDA had difficulty recovering its funds from RGM and suspected wrongdoing on the part of the company. MDA immediately reported the matter to the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD), and commenced legal action to recover the monies owed. After investigating the matter, CAD found that RGM’s principal, Devesh Chetty, had forged bank statements to hide MDA’s missing funds. In June 2016, CAD brought criminal charges against Chetty, who was found guilty of forgery and sentenced to 22 weeks’ of jail. The RGM entities were also wound up by the High Court.Following a review of the incident, MDA no longer enters into such equity co-investments given their inherently more complex nature and higher risks. Instead, MDA has moved to a grant-based model where money is disbursed only after clearly defined project deliverables are achieved. MDA has also instituted additional governance measures such as tightening the qualifying criteria for grants, implementing an online grant management system to improve the audit trail, and commissioning project audits directly instead of through the grant recipients. In addition, MDA has implemented whistle blowing hotlines for anyone to report potential wrongdoing to MDA."
use of cpf ordinary account by hdb lessees to service home loans,Mr Chen Show Mao asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how many current HDB lessees have reached their (i) Valuation Limit (VL) or (ii) Withdrawal Limit (WL) for the use of their CPF Ordinary Account to service their home loans; (b) how many appeals have been received by CPF Board or HDB in 2014 and 2015 for the continued use of CPF to finance HDB mortgages; and (c) how many appeals have been successful.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: The Valuation Limit (VL) policy encourages CPF members to make prudent property purchases and take up housing loans within their financial means. This helps to minimise the risk of CPF members not being able to recover the full amount of CPF that they had withdrawn for their property purchases upon sale.The VL is set at the lower of the purchase price or property value at the time of purchase. CPF members who have set aside their Basic Retirement Sum (BRS) can continue to use their CPF savings above the VL for housing. However, for properties purchased with bank loans, there is a cap known as the Withdrawal Limit (WL) which is set at 120% of the VL. In the case of Build-To-Order flats purchased with HDB loans, both the VL and WL do not apply as these are sold at subsidised prices.Currently, more than 500,000 HDB lessees use their CPF savings to service their housing instalments. Of these, about 15,000 (2.8%) have reached their VL and are still using CPF for their housing instalments. Another 2,500 (0.5%) have less than the BRS and hence cannot use CPF savings beyond their VL for housing. The number of lessees who have reached the WL is about 60 (0.01%).For affected CPF members who find it difficult to service their housing loans in cash after they reach the VL, flexibility can be provided upon appeal. In 2014 and 2015, CPF Board received a total of about 6,000 appeals, including repeated appeals, from members to use CPF savings beyond their VL. The majority of appeals from single property owners were successful. However, the general principle remains that members should be prudent in their housing purchase decisions, so as to put aside sufficient savings for their retirement needs."
publication of results of public opinion surveys by government agencies or statutory boards,Mr Chen Show Mao asked the Minister for Communications and Information regarding surveys of public opinion undertaken by Government agencies or statutory boards (a) under what conditions are the results of such surveys not published; and (b) how many instances of such opinion surveys have been published in 2010-2015 versus those that have not been published.,"Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim: Many agencies in Government conduct surveys to gather feedback on public perception of policies and issues. Such surveys enable our agencies to understand public sentiment on issues, and to assess public awareness of, and response to, specific government policies and programmes. Survey data has been used to evaluate if there are segments of the population who might benefit from a better understanding of a policy or programme. In some cases, such data allow us to adjust the way we deliver government services to better meet the needs of citizens.The Government does not compile statistics on the surveys conducted by various agencies, or which among them are published. In my own ministry (MCI), REACH periodically releases survey data on a range of issues. In recent years, REACH has released surveys of public perceptions on the annual Budget and the National Day Rally Speech, CPF changes, public transport, and the public's awareness of financial assistance schemes, among other subjects. These survey findings may also be found on REACH’s website."
reason train car at bukit panjang lrt failed to stop at three stations on 28 july 2016,"Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether LTA has investigated the reasons why a train car at Bukit Panjang LRT (BPLRT) failed to stop for three stations on 28 July 2016; and (b) in light of reports of jerking actions on some train cars by commuters, whether the BPLRT poses any safety issues for commuters.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Investigations are on-going. But preliminarily, reports from SMRT point to the fact that the Train Stop Antenna system was faulty. The Train Stop Antenna system controls the start and stop of the LRT train at each station. As the system was faulty, the train did not detect that it was arriving at the three stations from Jelapang to Bukit Panjang, and hence did not stop.The safety of the passengers was not compromised during the incident. The BPLRT is protected by the Automatic Train Protection (ATP) System. This ensures that trains do not exceed the maximum operating speed of 55km/hr, and that a minimum safe distance is kept between any two trains at all times. The ATP operates independently of the Train Stop Antenna system. The ATP system was functioning properly, and halted the train before Phoenix station, as it had detected another train ahead. As the ATP system is safety-critical, it has built-in redundancy. If one ATP Antenna malfunctions, the back-up will immediately take over. LTA and SMRT are working with the manufacturer, Bombardier, on the possibility of incorporating a similar redundancy into the Train Stop Antenna system."
minimum years of citizenship as additional qualifying criterion for silver support scheme,"Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Ministry will consider imposing the criterion that in order to qualify for the Silver Support Scheme, eligible Singaporeans must have been citizens for at least a certain number of years.","Mr Lim Swee Say: The Silver Support Scheme is the latest addition to our social safety net. It provides a cash supplement to the bottom 20% of Singaporeans aged 65 and above, who had low wages through life and who currently have little or no family support.The Pioneer Generation Package (PGP) is the only scheme that considers the year in which an individual becomes a citizen. This criterion is relevant because the PGP is meant to honour and thank all members of the first generation of Singaporeans who contributed to Singapore’s nation-building. It included all pioneers, irrespective of their means.The Silver Support Scheme on the other hand, like all other social assistance schemes, provides targeted support to Singaporeans who require additional help, regardless of their length of citizenship. Such schemes have various eligibility criteria in place to help ensure that the support is channelled to the intended beneficiaries."
sole distributorship agreements under competition act,"Dr Tan Wu Meng asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Trade) (a) whether the Competition Commission of Singapore regards sole distributorship agreements as anti-competitive under the Competition Act; and (b) if so, what are the preferred modes of redress for sole distributorship agreements.","Mr Lim Hng Kiang: Sole distributorship agreements are generally understood as vertical agreements, whereby a supplier sells its product through a single distributor. Such vertical agreements are not agreements between competitors and hence do not in themselves constitute anti-competitive behaviour under the Competition Act. However, anti-competitive behaviour can arise in a situation where a sole distributor abuses its market power to impose other restrictions in the market to impede its competitors from competing. The Competition Commission of Singapore (CCS) will have to assess each case based on the specific facts to determine if there is any infringement of the Act.In the event where a sole distributor is found to have infringed the Act, CCS has the power to impose a financial penalty on the infringing player, and also issue directions to bring the infringement to an end. This may include directing the infringing player to amend its sole distributorship agreement by removing the offending clauses, or by terminating the entire agreement."
use of medisave accounts of deceased members for their funeral expenses by family members,Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for Manpower whether balances in the Medisave accounts of deceased members can be deployed by family members to fund the funeral expenses of the deceased members according to their wishes.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: When a CPF member passes on, all CPF savings, including those in the Medisave Account are disbursed based on a CPF member’s nomination. In the absence of a nomination, they are disbursed by the Public Trustee according to intestacy laws.With a valid CPF nomination, nominees will generally receive their monies within four weeks from the date CPF Board receives their applications. This is because processing time is needed to check and verify the applications and supporting documents, to ensure that payments are made to the rightful nominees. Nominees who are responsible for the last rites can then use the bequest to pay for the funeral expenses."
licensed foreign employee dormitories,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how many foreign employee dormitories are currently licensed; (b) how many licensed operators have had enforcement actions taken against them; and (c) whether there have been any cases of breach of licence conditions which have resulted in revocation of licences.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: With the Foreign Employee Dormitories Act (FEDA) coming into operation on 1 January 2016, larger foreign employee dormitories with 1,000 beds or more will require a licence to operate. Operators were given six months to apply for a licence. To date, all 57 dormitories which require a licence have submitted their applications. Nine licences have been issued, and the remaining applications are being processed. All the licensed dormitories are in compliance with the FEDA. No licences have been revoked.The Ministry will conduct routine and ad-hoc inspections at all licensed dormitories to ensure that the operators abide by the licence conditions."
statistics on children born in singapore without father's name on birth certificate or with father named but parents not married at date of registration of birth,"Mr Kok Heng Leun asked the Minister for Social and Family Development over the last 10 years, what is the number of children born in Singapore who (i) do not have a father named on their birth certificate and (ii) have a father named on their birth certificate but the parents are not married on or before the date of registration of birth.","Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: From 2006 to 2015, there was a drop in the number of babies born each year to citizen mothers who were not married to the father of the child at the point of birth registration.The further breakdown by whether the father’s name is reflected in the birth certificate is as follows:"
upcoming survey on intangible cultural heritage,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth with regard to the upcoming survey on intangible cultural heritage (a) how will the vendors be evaluated for their expertise in conducting the survey; (b) whether all findings of the survey and findings from previous research done by the National Heritage Board will be released to the public and, if not, why not; and (c) whether there will be extensive public consultations in the creation of the national inventory.","28 Mr Kok Heng Leun asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth with regard to the intangible cultural heritage survey commissioned by NHB (a) whether a 16-month period is sufficient for a survey of such a scale; (b) whether the many other cases apart from the 150 cases will be covered; (c) whether there will be another survey conducted and, if so, when; (d) how will the agency conducting the survey be selected; and (e) what will NHB do with the survey and research results.Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: NHB is committed to safeguarding our tangible heritage, such as our national monuments. Beyond such tangible heritage, we also want to safeguard and deepen our understanding of Singapore’s intangible cultural heritage.We are guided by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) in definitions of intangible heritage. UNESCO describes intangible heritage to include practices, representations, expressions, knowledge and skills that communities and individuals recognise as part of their cultural heritage. Intangible cultural heritage is ""living"" heritage that is transmitted by communities, organisations and individuals from one generation to the next, and will evolve over time. These include rituals, traditions, foods and ways of life that bind us as Singaporeans. While Government agencies can support their promotion and transmission, the community and practitioners play a major role in safeguarding these aspects of our shared heritage.The upcoming survey will identify key elements of Singapore’s intangible cultural heritage. It will complement the tangible heritage survey that NHB embarked last year.As with all government procurement, we will evaluate the tender for the survey based on the key principles of transparency, open and fair competition, and value for money. The selected vendor needs to demonstrate their expertise in intangible cultural heritage as well as heritage research and fieldwork.We will share the findings on NHB’s online platforms such as the Roots.sg heritage portal, and through exhibitions and educational programmes that NHB will be developing. NHB’s past research findings on topics such as traditional trades are already available on Roots.sg and on its HeritageTV YouTube channel.NHB is working on the basis of a 16 month project duration to derive findings in this survey of Singapore’s intangible cultural heritage elements which can be shared with the public. As this is the first such survey to be undertaken, the length of time is assessed to be optimal for the scope defined and the resources to be dedicated to the survey.This survey is only the beginning of our efforts to deepen our understanding of our intangible heritage. After the survey is completed, NHB will continue to identify and document additional elements over time. NHB will also continue to collaborate with our partners to conduct more detailed research in selected areas. Currently, NHB’s survey is guided by its Heritage Advisory Panel comprising external experts from different fields. Over the coming months, NHB will consult heritage groups, stakeholders and practitioners; as well as invite the public to contribute their knowledge, memories and stories."
rationale for personal income tax relief cap,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Finance whether he can explain the rationale behind the personal income tax relief cap in greater detail especially in light of the effect it has on the Working Mother's Child Relief scheme.,"Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam: The personal income tax relief cap makes our personal income tax system more progressive. We currently have 15 personal income tax reliefs. Each tax relief serves a worthy objective. However, taken together, the tax reliefs may unduly reduce the taxable income for a number of individuals with high incomes. After studying the reliefs being claimed, we decided to limit the total reliefs that one individual can claim to reduce taxable income, in order to preserve the progressivity and fairness of our tax structure.The relief cap of $80,000 is set at a level that will not affect 99% of tax resident individuals. A majority of working mothers will not be affected. In fact, among those currently claiming the Working Mother’s Child Relief (WMCR), 9 out of 10 are expected to continue to claim it fully, without being affected by this cap. This includes those with more children – slightly over 8 in 10 individuals claiming WMCR on 2 or 3 children are not expected to be affected by the cap.Beyond tax reliefs, the Government provides a comprehensive suite of measures to support Singaporeans in having and raising children, managing work and family commitments, and sharing parental responsibilities. Over the years, we have introduced and significantly enhanced various schemes to support parents in having and raising children. This includes the Baby Bonus Cash Gift, Child Development Account (CDA), Medisave Grant for Newborns, Foreign Domestic Worker Levy Concession, and also the newly introduced CDA First Step. We also provide significant subsidies for education, from pre-school level through to the Institutes of Higher Learning.Our support for families also goes beyond monetary support, and includes our wider push to make it easier for families to manage their work and family responsibilities. For example, in 2013 we introduced Child Care Leave for parents of older children aged 7 to 12 years old and introduced one week of paternity leave. This year, we announced the legislation of a second week of Government-paid paternity leave for all fathers of citizen children born from 1 January 2017, and an increase in Shared Parental Leave from one week to four weeks for citizen children born from 1 July 2017. With all these measures, the Government remains committed to supporting Singaporeans in fulfilling their marriage and parenthood aspirations."
measures to deal with roadblock evasions,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Home Affairs in light of the increasing trend of roadblock evasions (a) how is the Ministry protecting police officers at such roadblocks; (b) how can road users be better protected during consequent car chases; and (c) whether there is a need to review the current legislation to deter roadblock evasions.,"Mr K Shanmugam: Police conduct road blocks to deter and detect crime. The safety of police officers and the general public is an important consideration in the planning and execution of road blocks. Light beacons and signs are also placed ahead of the road blocks to give motorists advance notice to slow down their vehicles, while officers don reflective vests to make them more prominent to road users. Police vehicles are deployed in a manner to cause approaching vehicles to slow down safely.The vast majority of motorists who encounter a road block comply with the directions of the Police. In the event of an evasion, Police will pursue the vehicle with full consideration for the safety of road users. Police will alert road users through the use of sirens and blinkers. Members of public are advised to give way to Police vehicles in a safe manner. Depending on the circumstances, Police will terminate the pursuit if it becomes too dangerous.Road block evasion is irresponsible and dangerous. As such, my Ministry amended the Police Force Act last year to increase the penalties for such offences. Offenders can be fined up to $5,000 and/or jailed up to one year. This is aligned with the penalty for the Penal Code offence of rash driving or riding which endangers the life or personal safety of others. Motorists who evade Police road blocks or otherwise endanger the lives of others will be dealt with firmly under our laws."
reason for increase in difference between corporate tax rate and rate of effective tax payable between fy2014 and fy 2015,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Finance (a) what is the reason for the increase in the difference between the corporate tax rate and the rate of effective tax payable between FY2014 and FY2015; and (b) why is there a significant gap between the chargeable income and effective tax paid depending on the industry sector.,"Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam: As corporate tax returns for the financial year (""FY"") ending 2015 are only required to be filed by 30 November 2016 , the effective tax rates for companies relating to the FY 2015 or Year of Assessment (""YA"") 2016 are not available yet.The corporate tax rate of 17% is applied to the chargeable income of a company to arrive at the tax payable. Chargeable income is derived after making the necessary adjustments to accounting net profits, such as for non-taxable gains of capital nature, unutilised losses carried forward from past years, as well as for allowable and non-allowable tax deductions and tax allowance.A company’s effective tax rate can be lower than 17% of its chargeable income due to a variety of factors, for example, corporate tax rebates that impact firms with different levels of profits differently, and tax credits allowed for foreign-sourced income which is remitted to Singapore. It may also reflect tax incentives granted for limited duration for qualifying economic activities in Singapore.As each company’s situation is different, rates of effective tax payable may vary across years and across industries. In general, effective tax rates among different industries vary by between one and two percentage points from the average across all industries."
public sector procurement guidelines for defective products supplied,"Dr Tan Wu Meng asked the Minister for Finance whether the public sector's procurement guidelines include ""lemon"" provisions for full replacement, rather than repair, in the event of significant defects being found in a significant proportion of supplied products.","Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam: The standard terms and conditions used in Government contracts for goods provide safeguards against ""lemons"". In particular, the supplier is required to completely repair goods that are found on delivery to be damaged, defective or in any way inferior to approved samples, or not in accordance with the contract. Further, in the event of significant defects, the supplier has to fully replace the goods. All repair and replacement costs, including the cost of returning the defective goods, are borne entirely by the supplier.Typically, payment is only made after the goods have been delivered in good condition to the Government. In addition, it is the norm for Government contracts to include warranty clauses which require the supplier to repair or replace faulty goods during the warranty period even after payment has been made."
applications for medifund and grants disbursed,"Mr Low Thia Khiang asked the Minister for Health (a) how many Medifund applications have been made in the past five years; (b) of these, how many have been rejected and what is the breakdown of the reasons for rejection; and (c) of the applications approved, what is the median, 20th percentile and 90th percentile quantum of Medifund grant disbursed in each case.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: About 670,000 Medifund applications were made per year in the past five years. These applications were surfaced to the Medifund Committees of the public healthcare institutions after assessment by medical social workers. Less than 0.15% of the applications were not approved by the Medifund Committees.The amount of Medifund granted to each recipient varies widely, depending on the patient’s bill size and copayment required, frequency of treatment and his financial circumstances. On average, in the past five years, more than 92% of Medifund applications were granted full assistance. In 2014, the average assistance provided ranged from $450 for day surgery to $1,800 for hospitalisations, $100 for outpatient treatment and $300 for care in the Intermediate and Long-term Care facilities."
review of standard drug list to include medication for common age-related illnesses,Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry will review the Standard Drug List to include medication that doctors frequently prescribe for common age-related illnesses.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Ministry of Health (MOH) Standard Drug List (SDL) is reviewed regularly to include new medications. Feedback from doctors regarding commonly used drugs, including those for age-related illnesses, are taken into account in these reviews.Over the last three years, 44 drugs have been added to the SDL, of which, 34 (77%) drugs are used for common age-related conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure.MOH will continue the practice of regular reviews of the SDL drug list."
status of review on need to repeal marital rape immunity,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is the status of the review on the need to repeal marital rape immunity as stated by the Government during the 32nd Human Rights Council; (b) when immunity from marital rape will be repealed; and (c) whether this will be a total or partial repeal with exceptions.,Mr K Shanmugam: This issue is being reviewed actively. We will give an update when the position is clearer.
conversion criteria for heavy vehicle parking lots and normal parking lots,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for National Development (a) what are the criteria for converting heavy vehicle parking lots into normal parking lots and vice-versa; and (b) what are the plans for lorry parking in the Changi Village area in view of its proximity to Changi Business Park and Changi Airport and the past conversion of heavy vehicle parking lots to normal parking lots in that vicinity.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: For public car parks, requests for conversion of heavy vehicle parking spaces to regular car parking spaces and vice versa are assessed depending on the needs of each location. For instance, in Changi Village, six heavy vehicle spaces were converted in September 2014 to mechanised car park spaces to mitigate the shortage of regular car park spaces in the area.We have also assessed that there is adequate provision of heavy vehicle parking spaces in the Changi area. Apart from public parking spaces, there are available private heavy vehicle parking spaces in or close to the area (see Table 1).Information on the latest availability of heavy vehicle parking spaces can be found on LTA’s One-Motoring website."
comprehensive national plan for managing e-waste,"Assoc Prof Randolph Tan asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether there is a comprehensive national plan for managing e-waste; (b) how does NEA facilitate e-waste recycling in Singapore; and (c) what are the statistics on the rate of e-waste recycling by entities differentiated according to commercial, Government and/or households categories.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: While my Ministry currently does not collect data on the rate of e-waste recycling by households, government or commercial entities, it is estimated from the available data that about 60,000 tonnes of e-waste is generated annually in Singapore. About half is estimated to be common household information technology (IT) products and home appliances, while the rest comprises information and communications technology (ICT) equipment generated by the commercial and industrial sectors.My Ministry is exploring options for a comprehensive system for the collection, recycling and management of e-waste to be implemented nationwide. The National Environment Agency (NEA) commissioned a study in March 2016 to develop possible options. The study includes a survey of the entire e-waste collection and recycling value chain, including treatment and disposal. The survey results will help in the development of feasible designs for an efficient and effective e-waste management framework, along with inputs from stakeholder consultations which will take place in the coming months.To facilitate e-waste recycling in Singapore and in preparation for the possible implementation of an e-waste management framework, we have formed a national voluntary partnership for e-waste recycling with interested stakeholders. The partnership comprises producers and retailers of electronic and electrical products, as well as e-waste recycling service providers.We also support voluntary recycling programmes such as REcycling Nation’s Electronic Waste (RENEW), which is led by StarHub, DHL and recycler TES-AMM. RENEW now covers 185 locations around Singapore with 235 e-waste recycling bins in place. We will work with our partners to expand these programmes and explore new ones, to increase awareness of e-waste recycling and provide convenient recycling services for the public."
building of primary and secondary schools and junior college in fernvale in sengkang,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Acting Minister for Education (Schools) whether there will be a new primary school, secondary school or junior college built in Fernvale in Sengkang and, if so, when will they be built.","Mr Ng Chee Meng: MOE regularly reviews the demand and supply trends at the national and regional levels to ensure that there are sufficient school places for school-going children. Our school planning takes into account the current and projected population and planned housing development programmes to ensure that there are sufficient school places to meet the needs of each residential area.While MOE tries to ensure that every child of school-going age in Singapore has a place in a school reasonably near his or her home, it will not always be possible to do so. Every new school needs to have a sufficient catchment of students, over a sustained period of time, to enable it to mount a range of activities for the benefit of the students, and to be run efficiently.There are currently two primary schools, Sengkang Green Primary and Fernvale Primary in Fernvale estate. MOE has plans to build a third primary school near the Kupang LRT station to meet the needs of residents moving into this new estate. Construction of the school is expected to start soon, and we will provide more details of when the school will be opened in due course.There are currently six secondary schools (Pei Hwa Secondary School, Nan Chiau High School, Compassvale Secondary School, CHIJ St. Joseph’s Convent, Seng Kang Secondary School and North Vista Secondary School) located in Sengkang. There are also other secondary schools, e.g. Hougang Secondary School, Xinmin Secondary School and Monfort Secondary School, which are located near Fernvale. As there are sufficient secondary school places in this area, we have no plans to build any new secondary school in Fernvale.There are no plans to build a new Junior College (JC) in Sengkang."
role of public universities' management in administering freshmen orientation camps,"Mr Ang Wei Neng asked the Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (a) what is the role of the universities' management in administering their freshmen orientation camps; (b) from 2014 to 2016, what is the number of freshmen orientation camps organised by the students in each of the public universities; (c) of these, how many of these camps have had their activity programmes amended as a result of the intervention by the respective universities' management; and (d) what are the measures the public universities will take to prevent inappropriate activities from occurring again during orientation camps.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: Each year, the autonomous universities hold approximately 120 student-organised freshmen orientation camps (FOCs) – these include camps organised by the faculties, halls, and other student groups. The proposals for these camps are vetted by both staff advisors and the Offices of Student Affairs at the universities. This process takes several months, and any inappropriate or unsafe activities are revised or removed during this process.NUS is currently conducting a review of its orientation processes in consultation with the NUS community, which is expected to take some time. NTU has recently completed a comprehensive overview of its orientation programmes to make them more inclusive.More generally, measures are in place to prevent the recurrence of recent activities. Student leaders and facilitators are carefully selected and briefed, and university staff are also on hand to ensure that activities are run in line with plans, and with students’ safety and interests in mind. In addition, all students are governed by the respective universities’ Student Codes of Conduct, where banned activities and their concomitant penalties are explicitly stated."
international students in polytechnics and universities not fulfilling their scholarship bonds,"Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (a) from 2010 to 2015, how many international students in polytechnics and universities have not fulfilled their scholarship bonds each year; (b) when did the Ministry put in place additional measures to track these students; and (c) what improvements in default rates have there been since the Ministry enhanced its efforts to track scholarship recipients.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: There are no MOE scholarships given to international students in the polytechnics.MOE takes a serious view towards the fulfilment of bond obligations by scholars. Over the past few years, MOE has progressively stepped up our enforcement measures to track and ensure that these scholars fulfil their bond obligations. For example, we have enhanced our data interfaces with partner agencies such as MOM and ICA from 2014, to better allow us to ascertain the employment status of our scholars.The proportion of defaulters is about 1%. We are also in the process of contacting another 4% to determine their bond service status. The rest – 95% – are serving their bonds, have applied for deferment, or are unable to serve their bond obligations due to reasons like illnesses.While MOE works closely with the universities and other agencies to track the bond obligations of our international scholars, the default rate might fluctuate slightly due to a number of factors, including economic climate."
non-fulfilment of scholarship bonds by foreign students graduating from nus and ntu,"Mr Ang Wei Neng asked the Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (a) in the past 10 years, how many foreign students did not complete their scholarship bonds after graduating from NUS and NTU; (b) how do the two universities follow up on the scholars who fail to serve their bonds; and (c) how much damages have not been collected due to non-fulfilment of scholarship bonds.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: The proportion of defaulters is about 1%. We are also in the process of contacting another 4% to determine their bond service status. The rest – 95% – are serving their bonds, have applied for deferment, or are unable to serve their bonds due to reasons like illnesses.As part of the enforcement process, scholars who are identified to be not serving their bond will be contacted and reminded by the universities of their obligations. Some may get back to the universities and inform that they are in between jobs and need more time. For scholars who continue to not serve their bond obligations, the universities will then proceed to recover liquidated damages from scholars and their sureties, failing which, defaulters will not be able to work or reside in Singapore.MOE will continue to work closely with all the universities to tighten and enhance the processes in monitoring and enforcing the scholarship bonds."
food centre and market at block 511 bedok north street 3 after expiry of lease in october 2017,"Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether the food centre and market at Block 511 Bedok North Street 3 is scheduled for improvements under the Hawker Centres Upgrading Programme or any form of renovations after its lease expires in October 2017; and (b) if not, what are the reasons.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The wet market and hawker centre at Block 511, Bedok North Street 3, has already been upgraded under the Hawker Centres Upgrading Programme (HUP) in July 2004. The HUP is a programme that the Government ran from 2001 and it finally ceased in 2014 after all eligible centres that opted for the programme had been upgraded.On its part, the Town Council is responsible for the management and maintenance of the common property of this centre, including carrying out the necessary cyclical repairs and redecorations (R&R) works such as re-painting of the centre and replacing any fixtures or fittings. Thus far, the respective Town Councils have carried out the cyclical R&R works for the centres under their purview in a timely and responsible manner."
graduate employment survey on local and overseas graduates,Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) whether the Ministry will consider conducting a comprehensive and robust Graduate Employment Survey (GES) that covers graduates from all six local universities as well as overseas graduates and graduates from local trans-national university programmes so as to provide a broader data source on graduate employment prospects to complement the GES exercises published by some individual universities.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: The Ministry of Education (MOE) currently publishes comprehensive information on the employment outcomes of fresh graduates from the full-time degree programmes offered by the five local Autonomous Universities (AUs), i.e. NTU, NUS, SMU, SIT and SUTD. Results for UniSIM will be available in 2018 when its first batch of full-time students graduates.Instead of having one comprehensive survey for all AUs, each AU conducts its own survey, with MOE standardising the methodology. That way, students have access to more information, on the full-time permanent employment rates and monthly salaries for graduates from each degree programme from each university, and can make better-informed decisions when choosing their course of study.The Council for Private Education (CPE) has commissioned a pilot graduate employment survey for graduates from Private Education Institutions (PEIs). The pilot survey polled graduates from nine of the largest PEIs, which covered the majority of private degree graduates in 2014. As mentioned in Parliament on 28 January 2016, CPE will make available information from this survey, to help support individuals in their decision making.MOE however does not track Singaporeans who go overseas to pursue their undergraduate studies."
cyber security measures in place at key installations and critical infrastructures,"Mr Darryl David asked the Minister for Communications and Information what are the cyber security measures in place in key institutions and installations such as the stock exchange, airports, sea ports, MRT stations, power stations and other critical infrastructure to ensure that the systems and networks of these institutions and installations are protected from cyber-attacks.","Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim: The Cyber Security Agency (CSA) adopts a sectorial approach to ensure Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) is protected from cyber threats. It does this by working closely with regulators in the eleven CII sectors (Aviation, Banking & Finance, Energy, Government, Healthcare, Infocomm, Land Transport, Maritime, Media, Security & Emergency Services, and Water). The eleven sector regulators in turn ensure that entities that operate CII facilities have adequate plans to deal with the cyber threat.To validate the sectorial and operator plans, CSA conducts cybersecurity exercises with and across critical sectors. This year, CSA conducted a multi-sector exercise, codenamed Cyber Star. The exercise validated the incident management capabilities of CSA and four critical sectors (Banking & Finance, Energy, Government and Infocomm) to deal with a large-scale cyber attack. CSA will continue to conduct exercises to validate the plans of other sectors, and also enhance the sophistication of the exercise scenarios.CSA is currently developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy, and the protection of CIIs from cyber threats will be an important part of the strategy. In 2017, we intend to introduce a new Cybersecurity Act that will enhance and improve existing rules on CIIs in the areas of protection, information sharing and incident response."
determination of coe quota for category d vehicles,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng asked the Minister for Transport (a) how is the COE quota for Category D vehicles being determined; and (b) what is the long-term trend of the allowable motorcycle population in Singapore in view of the needs of low-income workers to own motorcycles due to their work requirements.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The number of Category D COEs available for bidding every quarter is based on the number of motorcycles deregistered in the preceding quarter. Adjustments are then made to account for the allowable growth rate for the vehicle population, cancelled and expired COEs, as well as contributions to the Open Category. It is no different from how we derive quotas for the other COE categories.The number of motorcycles we should allow in Singapore is tied to how much we can grow our overall vehicle population, which will ultimately be limited by our land constraints. In this regard, at some point, we will have to bring the allowable vehicle growth rate to zero. By giving motorcycles a distinct COE category, Category D, we have limited the extent to which motorcycles will be replaced by cars within the vehicle population. We have also reduced the contribution by various COE categories, including Category D, to the Open Category from 25% just a few years ago, to 10% currently. We will continue to monitor the trend of Category D quotas, and make further adjustments if necessary."
review of need for inspection of new cars from third year onwards,Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the Ministry will consider reviewing the current practice of subjecting registered new cars for inspection from the third year onwards to the fourth year instead as increasingly there have been new improvements in car designs and higher safety standards in vehicles; and (b) whether inspection works done by authorised car dealers who provide servicing and maintenance of fairly new vehicles can also qualify as approved inspection works and their reports taken as a proxy for the third year instead of sending the vehicle to an inspection center.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The inspection passing rate for three-year-old cars is about 93% and has not improved in the last five years. This is despite new car designs and technological features. There is therefore no strong case for conducting the first inspection in the fourth rather than the third year.LTA's authorised inspection centres do not provide vehicle repair and maintenance services. This allows them to be independent and objective in their inspection, and removes any possibility of a conflict of interest. This is not the case for motor dealers."
number of female bus captains employed by public bus operators,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the breakdown in numbers of female bus captains currently employed by the four public bus operators; and (b) whether LTA has any plans to work with the public bus operators to recruit more women to join the bus captain profession especially those seeking to re-enter the workforce.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The four public bus operators currently employ 575 female bus captains, of whom 404 are in SBS Transit, 142 in SMRT Corporation, 26 in Tower Transit Singapore, and 3 in Go-Ahead Singapore. They make up about 6% of the total number of bus captains.LTA has been working with the operators to recruit more local bus captains, including women. For example, SBS Transit and SMRT Corporation have introduced part-time employment schemes which can appeal to those who need some work schedule flexibility because of family commitments. Tower Transit Singapore and Go-Ahead Singapore offer female employees up to 26 weeks of paid maternity leave. Tower Transit Singapore also offers female employees an enhanced maternity benefit of $300 to $700 annually, as well as additional childcare leave."
erection of noise barriers between chua chu kang and bukit gombak mrt stations,Mr Zaqy Mohamad asked the Minister for Transport (a) when will noise barriers be set up between Chua Chu Kang and Bukit Gombak MRT stations; (b) what are the locations of these barriers; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider the inclusion of new BTO developments such as Keat Hong Pride and Keat Hong Crest in the implementation of these noise barriers due to their close proximity to the MRT tracks.|,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The Land Transport Authority (LTA) will call the tenders to install noise barriers near the residential blocks between Chua Chu Kang and Bukit Gombak MRT stations in the second half of this year. The noise barriers will be installed at viaducts frontinga. Block 369 to Block 338 and Block 383 to 395, Bukit Batok West Avenue 5b. Block 296D to 297D and Block 272 to Block 279, Chua Chu Kang Avenue 2c. Block 224 to 223 Chua Chu Kang Central, andd. Block 353 to 355 Chua Chu Kang Loop.New residential developments that are close to existing railway viaducts, including Keat Hong Pride and Keat Hong Crest, must comply with setback and noise mitigation requirements. These should be able to address the noise issue adequately."
government expenditure on advertisements and sponsored posts on online media platforms,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) for each year from 2011 to 2015, how much has the Government spent on advertisements and sponsored posts on online media platforms including but not limited to Facebook, YouTube and Google; and (b) what is the breakdown of this spending by each Ministry.","Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim: The Government does not keep track of the total amount ministries spend on online advertisements. However, MCI itself spent approximately $4.3 million last year (or 0.5% of our operating budget) on digital advertisements to support a wide range of major policies and initiatives such as the Pioneer Generation Package, SkillsFuture, Marriage and Parenthood and Integration issues. This was spread out across multiple online media platforms, including YouTube, Facebook and Google."
need for pram-friendly buses,"Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Transport as the current design of wheelchair-accessible buses does not provide for means to secure open prams and LTA has deemed it safer for the caregiver to be seated with the child in his or her arms and the pram folded, how can LTA help to ensure inclusiveness in our public transport system to better cater to the needs of families with young children.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: I agree with the Member that our public transport system must be inclusive and cater to the needs of different commuters, including families with young children. Our bus captains and MRT station staff are trained to assist passengers with strollers. We have priority seats for young children and their caregivers. LTA, together with our bus operators, is also studying ways of safely securing strollers on board our buses."
green-man plus scheme at pedestrian crossing along potong pasir avenue 1,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for Transport whether the implementation of the Green Man Plus Scheme at the pedestrian crossing along Potong Pasir Avenue 1 between blocks 109 and 141 that is currently scheduled for June 2017 can be done earlier so as to aid the elderly and disabled residents living in the vicinity.,Mr Khaw Boon Wan: LTA prioritises its implementation of Green Man Plus in areas where there is a high number of elderly residents. LTA will look into whether it is possible to expedite the implementation at Potong Pasir Avenue 1.
taxi stand in vicinity of blocks 216 to 222 at lorong 8 toa payoh,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for Transport whether a taxi stand can be implemented at a suitable location in the vicinity of blocks 216 to 222 at Lorong 8 Toa Payoh at the request of the residents who reside in the area.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: We build taxi stands in locations where there is high taxi demand, to facilitate pick-up and reduce disruption to traffic flow. As the taxi demand along Lorong 8 Toa Payoh is relatively irregular and low, it would be difficult to justify building a taxi stand there."
implementation of tray return initiative at all nea-managed hawker centres,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether the tray return initiative for hawker centres started in 2012 has been implemented for all NEA-managed hawker centres; (b) if so, what is the total cost of the initiative; (c) whether and how the initiative has been assessed for its success; (d) whether the initiative has reduced the number of cleaners needed; and (e) how is the tray return system integrated with the food waste recycling trials at the two hawker centres undergoing these trials.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Tray-return was introduced by the National Environment Agency (NEA) to hawker centres in 2012 and tray-return facilities have been progressively implemented in all hawker centres since July 2015 at an average cost of about $11,000 per hawker centre.The tray-return rates at our hawker centres vary from centre to centre, with the highest tray-return rates at Tiong Bahru Market and Block 137 Tampines Street 11. However, we can and should do better in achieving higher tray-return rates. The NEA is working with the Public Hygiene Council and the Singapore Kindness Movement to raise awareness of the tray-return initiative, for example by garnering support from schools, community organisations and corporations, including food court and fast food operators under the Tray-Return Partnership. We are also looking at incorporating tray-return stations that are more visible, prominent and accessible. Through these efforts, we hope to co-develop solutions to make it easier for everyone to return their trays and make the dining experience at hawker centres a more pleasant one for all.At Ang Mo Kio Block 628 Market and Tiong Bahru Market where on-site food waste recycling projects are ongoing, food waste is segregated by cleaners when crockery is returned at the tray-return stations and when they collect the crockery during table-cleaning. The segregated food waste is then brought to the bin centre for recycling. NEA and the appointed food waste recycling companies have conducted training sessions with the cleaners at both centres on how to segregate food waste at the tray-return stations and during table-cleaning.Tray-return will improve the overall level of cleanliness and hygiene in hawker centres by minimising the amount of food scraps left on the tables. It will also help the cleaners increase their work efficiency and will, over time, ease the manpower constraints faced by the cleaning sector. My Ministry will continue with our efforts to educate and raise awareness of tray-return to build this culture. Ultimately, cleaning up after ourselves is not just about raising productivity or ensuring better hygiene and cleanliness but simply a reflection of our social graciousness and consideration for others. I hope that all of us can continue to play our part in returning our trays not just in hawker centres but in other food outlets as well."
data on unsold food discarded by supermarkets,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether the Ministry currently collects data on the amount of unsold food discarded by supermarkets every year; and (b) if it does, how much unsold food is discarded and, if it does not, whether it will consider collecting such data.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: While my Ministry currently does not collect data on the amount of unsold food disposed of by supermarkets specifically, it tracks the total amount of food waste disposed of in Singapore. This is obtained from waste sampling and disposal data at incineration plants. My Ministry also keeps track of the total amount of food waste recycled which is compiled from the records of food waste recyclers.Under the mandatory waste reporting requirements, my Ministry collects data on the amount of food waste recycled by large hotels and shopping malls. The mandatory reporting of waste data and waste reduction plans helps build greater awareness among building managers on the potential for waste reduction on their premises.Over the past 10 years, the amount of food waste generated in Singapore has increased by almost 50% and is expected to rise further with population growth and greater affluence. Besides the effort and energy needed to collect and dispose of it, food waste also contaminates recyclables and gives rise to odour and pest issues if not managed properly. Hence, there is a need to manage food waste in a holistic way in terms of minimisation, redistribution and recycling.As part of ongoing outreach efforts, my Ministry launched a programme last November to encourage everyone to reduce food wastage. It has also worked with various food retail businesses, including the supermarkets, to encourage consumers not to waste food. In addition, my Ministry is working on good practice guides for food manufacturers, retail establishments and supermarkets to minimise waste across the food supply chain. These include guidelines for the proper handling and re-distribution of unsold and excess food to food distribution organisations such as Food Bank Singapore and Food from the Heart.My Ministry is also conducting projects to evaluate cost-effective methods for collecting and recycling food waste. On-site food waste recycling machines have been installed at two hawker centres to convert food waste to either water or bio-fertiliser. In a separate project, source-segregated food waste will be collected from multiple premises in Clementi. The collected food waste will be mixed with used water sludge to produce biogas at a pilot facility at the Ulu Pandan Water Reclamation Plant.With regard to the suggestion to collect food waste data from supermarkets, my Ministry is currently considering enhancing the mandatory waste reporting requirements and extending waste reporting to other premises that generate large amounts of waste including food waste."
nea's plans for appointment of community volunteers as auxiliary officers,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what are the immediate plans for appointing community volunteers as auxiliary officers to assist NEA in performing its functions; (b) what enforcement powers will be given to the volunteers; and (c) how many volunteers will be deployed and for what purposes.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The National Environment Agency (NEA) started the Community Volunteer (CV) Programme in 2013 to empower members of environment-related non-Government organisations (NGOs) to take on larger roles in strengthening public ownership of the environment. Since May 2016, individuals who are not members of any NGO but who meet the stringent selection criteria and fulfil the requisite training can also be appointed as a CV. There are currently about 380 CVs and about another 100 individuals have expressed interest to join the CV programme.The role of the CV is to engage and educate environmental offenders to keep our environment clean as well as to inculcate greater community ownership of the environment. CVs are required to adopt specific geographical areas and lead by example to promote good social norms through participating in monthly environmental activities such as litter picking and educating environmental offenders within these adopted areas. The newly-appointed CVs are also required to be accompanied by NEA officers as part of their training to learn how to engage offenders.As the primary role of the CVs is to encourage members of the public to take responsibility for the environment, the CVs will not be issuing enforcement tickets directly. The CVs will only use their authority card to request the particulars of a non-compliant offender for NEA's investigations. NEA will then follow through with enforcement where necessary. With the passing of the National Environment Agency (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2016 earlier this year, the CVs will be provided with powers to request particulars from persons found to have committed environmental offences beyond littering, such as smoking in prohibited places, spitting, urinating or defecating in public places, failing to properly remove animal faecal matter from public places, as well as leaving the engine of a stationary vehicle to idle.Through the CV programme, we hope that more people will learn to take ownership of the environment. After all, care for the environment is a shared responsibility and everyone needs to play a part in ensuring a clean and liveable Singapore."
procedure for collection of materials in recycling bins by public waste collectors at point of collection,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether it is standard procedure for recycling bins to be emptied into a single receptacle by public waste collectors at the point of collection; and (b) if so, what is the objective of asking residents to separate the waste into different bins for different recyclable items.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Under the National Recycling Programme (NRP), public waste collectors are required to provide a blue co-mingled recycling bin at every HDB block and landed premises. This co-mingled system makes it convenient for residents to recycle as they do not need to spend additional time and effort to segregate the different types of recyclables (i.e. paper, metal, plastic and glass) nor set aside additional space in their homes to store the different types of recyclables.The National Environment Agency (NEA) requires the public waste collectors to use dedicated trucks to collect recyclables. These trucks are labelled accordingly as vehicles for the collection of recyclables. NEA monitors these trucks to ensure recyclables are collected and sent to the Materials Recovery Facility. NEA will impose a financial penalty on any public waste collector found to have collected waste and recyclables using the same truck. At the Material Recovery Facilities, the recyclables are sorted, baled and sent to local recyclers or exported for recycling.Besides the NRP implemented for households, we also encourage private premises such as shopping malls and hotels to participate in the recycling effort by providing recycling bins on their premises. For these premises, the infrastructure and collection methods are decided and provided by the premises owner and these can vary across premises. Some premises may provide segregated recycling bins as patrons tend to dispose of singular items such as aluminium cans or plastic bottles."
early detection and intervention measures for young students with learning difficulties,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Acting Minister for Education (Schools) what measures are currently in place to provide for the early detection and intervention for young students who have learning difficulties and what more can and will be done to help such students and their parents.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: Schools have measures in place to identify students with learning difficulties and provide timely and appropriate intervention.Upon entry into Primary 1, schools conduct early literacy and numeracy screening to identify students who need additional support to level up their literacy and numeracy skills. There are learning support programmes to help these students acquire the basic literacy and numeracy skills. Support in these programmes is extended all the way to secondary school levels if the child needs it.In addition, students with dyslexia may attend the School-based Dyslexia Remediation (SDR) Programme or the MOE-aided literacy remediation at the Dyslexia Association of Singapore. MOE also provides resources for parents to support their children with dyslexia on the MOE Social Media Platforms such as Schoolbag.sg. Students with learning difficulties may also be referred to MOE Psychologists for further assessment and consultation on follow-up support.There are also trained personnel such as Teachers trained in Special Needs, Allied Educators for Learning and Behavioural Support, and School Counsellors to provide case consultation and intervention for students with learning disabilities such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder or mild Autism Spectrum Disorder. MOE also collaborates with the Institute of Mental Health to make available the REACH (Response, Early Intervention and Assessment in Community mental Health) services where students can be assessed for further support and intervention including advice for parents and caregivers."
law on hybrid cars with combustion engines switched off when stationary,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether section 21 of the Environmental Protection and Management (Vehicular Emissions) Regulations applies to hybrid cars which have their combustion engines switched off (with transfer to the use of an electric motor) when the car is stationary.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Under Regulation 21 of the Environmental Protection and Management (Vehicular Emissions) Regulations, it is an offence to leave the engine of a vehicle running when it is stationary for reasons other than traffic conditions. Leaving the engine running when the vehicle is stationary results in fuel wastage and unnecessary environmental pollution.Hybrid vehicles are equipped with an internal combustion engine and an electric motor powered by a battery pack. If the battery pack is unable to meet the electrical energy needed to operate the in-vehicle auxiliary systems such as the air-conditioning or the radio when the vehicle is stationary, the internal combustion engine will automatically re-start to provide the energy needed, thereby generating tailpipe emissions. Hence, hybrid vehicles can still emit tailpipe emissions when stationary and thus the regulations on idling engines also apply to hybrid vehicles.To promote greater awareness of the regulation, NEA has installed anti-vehicle idling signage at places where vehicles frequently congregate, such as carparks, loading/unloading bays and along the roadside near schools. In addition, NEA also works closely with stakeholders such as the authorised vehicle inspection centres, private and public transport operators and schools to disseminate educational pamphlets and decals."
"development plans for wet market and hawker centre at block 511, bedok north street after expiry of lease","Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources what are the development plans for the wet market and hawker centre at Block 511, Bedok North Street after the expiry of its lease in October 2017.","Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Currently, when the lease for a wet market and hawker centre expires, stall-owners who wish to continue their businesses will have the option to do so. Those previously on the subsidised scheme will pay the current subsidised rent while those who were not previously subsidised can either pay the prevailing market rent or tender for vacant stalls. The National Environment Agency (NEA) has been studying alternative management models for hawker centres and will consider where it can be applied so long as the fundamental objective of hawker centres in providing affordable, hygienic food is maintained.Just like other sold centres whose leases had expired earlier, the wet market and hawker centre at Block 511, Bedok North Street 3 will continue to operate after the stall leases expire on 31 October 2017. The Town Council remains responsible for the maintenance of this centre and must arrange for any necessary repairs and redecorations (R&R) to be done."
typical lifespan of hdb lifts and their replacement,"Mr Ang Wei Neng asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the typical life span of HDB lifts; (b) in the past five years, how many HDB lifts have been replaced before the end of the specified life span as stated at the point of procurement; and (c) of these, how many lifts have been replaced due to unavailability of spare parts.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Like any machinery or equipment, there is no definitive life span for a lift. Much depends on the intensity of use and standard of maintenance. Nevertheless, as a guide to help the Town Councils (TCs) in their planning and budgeting, HDB has recommended a schedule of 28 years for lift replacement.HDB does not have statistics on the number of lifts replaced before 28 years, or the condition of lifts at the point of replacement, as the maintenance and replacement of lifts are the responsibility of the respective TCs."
plans and timeline for a hawker centre in chua chu kang town,Mr Zaqy Mohamad asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources what are the Ministry's plans and timeline to set up a hawker center in Chua Chu Kang Town.,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Chua Chu Kang is one of the towns identified for a new hawker centre by 2027. My Ministry is working on the details of the location and timeline of the new hawker centre and more information will be provided when the plans are ready.
victim compensation orders granted under section 359 of criminal procedure code,Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for Law (a) how many victim compensation orders have been granted by the courts under section 359 of the Criminal Procedure Code in 2014 and 2015 respectively; (b) whether the courts have made any orders of compensation against the prosecution or informant for frivolous or vexatious prosecutions under section 359(3); and (c) what is the range of compensation amounts awarded and for what types of offences.,"Mr K Shanmugam: Section 359 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) allows for claims for compensation in criminal proceedings and makes it mandatory for a court convicting a person of any offence to consider whether a compensation order should be made, and the court will make such compensation orders where appropriate. The number of victim compensation orders that were granted by the Courts under section 359 of the CPC in 2014 and 2015 can be found in the following Table:Of the compensation orders made in 2014 and 2015, 84% were made in relation to cases involving hurt, mischief, theft, cheating and criminal breach of trust. In 75% of all instances where compensation orders were made, the compensation amounts were less than $2,000. In the remaining instances, the compensation amounts were between $2,000 and $10,000, with one compensation order amounting to $57,000 (rounded) for a charge of criminal breach of trust.The State Courts tracks the total number of compensation orders made under section 359 of the CPC. No breakdown is available on the number of orders made under the different sub-sections in that provision."
"regulars, nsmen and nsfs diagnosed with mental health problems","Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Defence (a) for each year from 2011, what is the breakdown of numbers of regulars, NSmen and NSFs diagnosed with mental health problems as a result of or aggravated due to service; (b) how does the SAF train its commanders to identify and support personnel with mental health issues and ensure compliance with the necessary protocols; and (c) whether the SAF takes responsibility for the treatment and compensation for such cases including that for servicemen who have left service.","Dr Ng Eng Hen: The SAF is a microcosm of Singapore society as we enlist males for full-time National Service and In-Camp Training thereafter. The incidence of mental health conditions among NSFs is about 4% and is lower than the 7% national incidence of Singaporeans age 18-34, reported in a 2012 study by the Institute of Mental Health3.Many factors can predispose an individual to mental health problems which include individual, familial and relationship factors and may not be related to his place of work or service. Whatever the cause, the SAF's goal is to ensure the mental and physical well-being of its servicemen through a multi-prong approach. Training is conducted for commanders to enhance their understanding of mental health problems, so that they can better identify and manage servicemen with such problems which include referral to trained professionals. Servicemen with known mental health conditions before enlistment are monitored and provided with counselling and medical treatment. There are also dedicated psychologists at the formation level. In addition, servicemen can call a 24-hour SAF Counselling Hotline whenever they need help.Compensation for injuries, both mental and physical, sustained in the course of service follows closely the Work Injury Compensation Act (WICA) but is generally more generous in amounts paid. Medical expenses incurred for the treatment of the condition at government and restructured hospitals or clinics is also paid as long as treatment is required, even after the serviceman has left service."
involvement of phone scam suspects arrested overseas in phone scams in singapore,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether the phone scam suspects arrested recently by several countries have also been involved in Singapore's phone scam; (b) if so, how do the authorities work with the international agencies to bring them to justice; and (c) whether the suspects can be tried in Singapore if found to have committed the phone scam crime in Singapore especially where there are Singaporean victims.","Mr K Shanmugam: The widespread use of social media and messaging platforms on mobile phones has given rise to new scam tactics. Scams are now being committed not just through phone conversations but also over the Internet accessed through mobile phones. Such scams include credit-for-sex scam, internet love scam, kidnap hoax scam and lottery scam. There were 2,450 of such cases in 2015 as compared to 1,015 cases in 2014.These cases are typically committed by sophisticated scam syndicates based overseas. The transnational nature of these crimes present significant enforcement challenges. The syndicates know that such transnational crimes are not easy to solve. They hide behind the anonymity of the Internet platforms, leverage the ease of online payment and choose victims that are not from the country where the syndicate is based.Where foreign law enforcement agencies are willing to cooperate, the Singapore Police Force (SPF) will work closely with them to take action against these overseas syndicates. In 2015, the SPF conducted a joint investigation with the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) of the People's Republic of China into a credit-for-sex scam syndicate that targeted Singaporean victims. The syndicate operated from China, using social media platforms to deceive Singaporean victims into paying money for non-existent sexual services. According to the Chinese Police, this syndicate may have also targeted victims in Australia. As a result of the joint investigation, the Chinese Police conducted successful raids at various locations in China that led to the arrest of 43 individuals. These individuals will be dealt with by the Chinese authorities.The best defence against online and phone scammer is prevention. Together with the National Crime Prevention Council, the Police will continue with its public education and outreach efforts to create more public awareness about the various scam tactics. Members of the public are advised to exercise caution and vigilance to avoid falling victim to such scams."
need for upfront settlement of bills by patients fully covered by insurance policies upon discharge from hospital,Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the reason for holders of health insurance policies being required to pay first and be reimbursed later after they are discharged from hospitalisation even though they are fully covered by their insurance policies; and (b) whether the Ministry can look into streamlining the payment process for policy holders who are fully covered by their insurance plans.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: With the implementation of MediShield Life for all Singaporeans, we have streamlined our processes so that Singapore Citizens who choose Class B2 or C wards will not need to pay deposits. There is an exception of a small number of patients, who will need to pay a deposit if they choose Class B2 against financial counselling advice so as to encourage them to choose the class they can better afford. The public hospitals will also advise patients who need help with their healthcare bills and discuss with them options for assistance.For private patients who choose private hospitals or Class A or B1 wards in the public hospitals, their bills are much higher as they do not enjoy the heavy subsidy for B2/C wards. Thus, hospitals may require them to make upfront payment, such as a deposit pre-admission, to cover their estimated hospitalisation cost. Once the bill and the insurance payout is finalised, they will be reimbursed for any excess payments.Even if the patient has private insurance, hospitals have no certainty over the patient’s insurance payout, given the range of private insurance policies with different coverage, terms and exclusions for pre-existing conditions. Therefore, they may collect a deposit. However, hospitals may waive or reduce the deposit if the patient’s insurer issues an upfront Letter of Guarantee to cover all or part of the estimated bill. Today, all the six Integrated Shield Plan insurers issue Letters of Guarantee usually with coverage of up to $10,000, if the patient meets their criteria."
compliance with national standards of care in nursing homes,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Health (a) whether there is a set of national standards to ensure that the care offered in nursing homes meets minimum standards for facilities, space, staff training, experience, hygiene, management and supervision; (b) whether there is third party assessment by a national accreditation body to ensure compliance to such standards; and (c) if not, whether the Ministry will consider implementing such a system.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: All nursing homes are licensed under the Private Hospitals & Medical Clinics (PHMC) Act. The licensing requirements cover standards in areas such as medical and nursing care, facilities maintenance and up-keeping, and general hygiene.MOH conducts regular checks to ensure that nursing homes meet the licensing requirements and care standards. MOH also engages independent auditors to further assess care standards in areas such as infection control, wound care and nursing management in the nursing homes. In addition, we have the Nursing Home Visitors Programme where volunteers will visit the nursing homes to obtain direct feedback from residents and their family members, as well as observe the living environment.MOH regularly reviews and enhances the care standards in our nursing homes. In 2014, an industry-led workgroup was convened to develop enhanced nursing home standards in the areas of clinical care, social care and organisational excellence. The workgroup's recommendations were subsequently incorporated into licensing requirements in April 2015 and enforced with effect from April 2016."
young persons processed for criminal offences through state courts,Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for Law (a) how many young persons aged between 16 and 18 years have been processed for criminal offences through the State Courts in the last three years; (b) which offence types have been most often charged against these young persons; and (c) what have been the most common types of sentences or orders made upon conviction of such persons.,"Mr K Shanmugam: Between 2013 and 2015, 2,254 young persons aged between 16 and 18 years have been charged for criminal offences in the State Courts.The most common types of offences which these young persons have been charged with are the offences of theft and cheating under the Penal Code, and offences under the Moneylenders Act, Tobacco (Control of Advertisements and Sale) Act, and the Road Traffic Act.While we continue to underscore the need to maintain law and order in our criminal justice system, we recognise the importance of rehabilitation as well for young offenders in appropriate cases. Between 2013 and 2015, 2,046 young persons aged between 16 and 18 years were convicted, of which close to half of these young persons were given Probation (or Probation and other types of sentences such as a fine), while about 30% were sentenced to a fine (or a sentence of fine and disqualification from holding or obtaining a driving licence under the Road Traffic Act) and about 15% were sentenced to Reformative Training (or Reformative Training and other types of sentences such as a fine)."
deployment of auxiliary police officers and cctvs at liquor control zone in little india,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is the number of Auxiliary Police Officers (APOs) deployed and the number of CCTVs installed at the Liquor Control Zone (LCZ) in Little India; and (b) whether the APOs conduct vertical foot patrols of the staircase landings of HDB blocks within the LCZ.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The Police deploy Auxiliary Police Officers (APOs) and Security Officers (SOs) in Little India on a daily basis to deter crime and dis-amenities such as urination, littering and spitting. During the peak periods on weekend nights, eves of Public Holidays and Public Holidays, more than 90 APOs and SOs are deployed. This is in addition to the Police officers on patrol.Currently, there are 34 Police Camera Zone CCTV cameras installed within the Little India Liquor Control Zone (LCZ), and SPF has plans to install an additional 50 cameras in this zone by the end of the year.The APOs and SOs will patrol the common areas as well as specific areas of concern. This includes the higher floors and staircase landings of HDB blocks where specific feedback has been received about congregations or dis-amenities."
cases reported on singapore academy of law website,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked the Minister for Law (a) how does the Singapore Academy of Law decide on the cases to be reported on its website; (b) what is the duration for which the cases will remain on its website; (c) what are the requirements for their removal; and (d) whether Court of Appeal cases heard in overseas jurisdictions are included in the website or only those heard in Singapore.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The Singapore Academy of Law (SAL) manages two websites which contain judgments, namely the Singapore Law Watch website (at www.singaporelawwatch.sg) (the SLW Website) and the Singapore Law website (at www.singaporelaw.sg) (the SgLaw Website).According to SALa. All judgments from the Supreme Court of Singapore are published on the SLW Website and the SgLaw Website. There is no selection process.b. Judgments from the Supreme Court of Singapore are published on the SLW Website for a period of three months, and on the SgLaw Website in perpetuity.c. Judgments are redacted or not published only where this is required by law, or by an order of Court.d. The SLW Website and the SgLaw Website only publish judgments from the Supreme Court of Singapore. They do not publish judgments from other jurisdictions."
offenders taken to task for consumption of alcohol in public places during restricted hours,"Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye asked the Minister for Home Affairs since the Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Act came into effect on 1 April 2015, how many offenders have been taken to task for consuming alcohol in public places during restricted hours, particularly within the Liquor Control Zone in Little India.","Mr K Shanmugam: As of 31 May 2016, more than 1,800 individuals were found to be consuming liquor during restricted hours since the Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Act came into effect on 1 April 2015. Within the Liquor Control Zone in Little India, about 230 individuals were found to be consuming liquor during restricted hours.Most of these individuals were first-time offenders and were issued with advisories. There were 48 repeat offenders island-wide, of which three were within the Little India Liquor Control Zone, and they have all been offered composition fines. For subsequent repeat offences, SPF will commence investigations with the view to prosecute and the offenders will be subject to stricter penalties."
plans for wider use of automated vehicle systems in transport system,Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether there are plans to incorporate a wider use of automated vehicle systems into our transport system; (b) how energy-efficient and cost-effective are these systems; and (c) what plans are there to help drivers who may be inevitably displaced.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: There is a broad spectrum of automated vehicle systems. Driverless trains have been in use in our MRT and LRT networks for more than 15 years. As for self-driving vehicles that can travel freely on public roads, the technology is advancing rapidly. My Ministry is leading a Committee on Automated Road Transport for Singapore, comprising public and private sector members, to chart the development and deployment of the technology in Singapore. Four major initiatives are being pursued concurrently. First, we are working with industry and research institutions to develop and trial self-driving buses. Second, we are planning for fleets of self-driving pods to provide on-demand, point-to-point mobility services for first-and-last-mile travel in the neighbourhood, and will be trialling them in Sentosa and One-North for a start. Third, we are working with PSA to trial truck-platooning between our port terminals, where one driven container truck can lead a few other driverless ones following behind. Fourth, we are working with National Environment Agency (NEA) to develop and trial self-driving utility vehicles such as for road cleaning, and these can be deployed for service during the wee hours, reducing road congestion.The technology is expected to improve cost effectiveness of the respective operations in the long run. However, as it is still evolving, it is premature to say by how much.Singapore faces a shortage of bus, truck and other drivers. In the near term, automation can help alleviate some of this shortage. However, there may indeed come a day in the further future when the need for driving is substantially reduced. We will then need to equip existing drivers with new skills for different vocations."
posting of job openings in public service on national jobs bank,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Prime Minister whether all job openings in the Public Service can be posted not just on Careers@Gov but on the National Jobs Bank which is a portal to encourage job postings by all employers other than those mandated under the Fair Consideration Framework.,"Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): Currently, Public Service agencies have to separately prepare and post up job advertisements on the Careers@Gov portal and Jobs Bank if they wish to advertise the same job on both portals. Notwithstanding this, Public Service agencies have been posting an average of 268 jobs on Job Banks per month, which is about 21% of total public sector jobs advertised.To make the process more convenient, PSD is working with WDA to build an interface between Careers@Gov portal and Jobs Bank. The interface allows job advertisements on Careers@Gov portal to be easily copied to Jobs Bank. This is expected to be ready by the end of the year."
statistics on malaysian cars entering and leaving singapore and traffic offences committed,Mr Low Thia Khiang asked the Minister for Transport (a) how many Malaysian cars have entered and left Singapore each year from 2010 to 2015; and (b) how many traffic offences involving Malaysian cars have there been during this time.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: From 2010 to 2015, Malaysia-registered cars made an average of 4,000,000 trips to Singapore each year. In the same period, foreign-registered cars were involved in an average of 11,000 traffic offences each year."
measures to deter pet abandonment,Ms Tin Pei Ling asked the Minister for National Development what are the measures taken to deter pet abandonment and lower the burden of proof in a pet abandonment case so that the irresponsible owner can be taken to task.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA) has been educating the public on responsible pet ownership to reduce pet abandonment. To prevent impulsive pet buying, AVA has restricted pet retailers from selling pets to individuals below 16 years old since January 2014. Pet retailers are also required to assess the suitability of their customers as pet owners prior to sale of the pet animal.In addition, AVA raised the dog licensing fees for unsterilised dogs from $70 to $90 in February 2014. This will encourage dog owners to sterilise their pets to prevent non-intentional breeding, which could contribute to abandonment of unwanted puppies.The Animals and Birds Act was amended in 2014 to enhance animal welfare. To lower the burden of proof, the amendments made the act of abandonment an offence without having to consider whether the animal was suffering or in distress as a result of abandonment. In addition, a person found guilty of pet abandonment may be fined up to $10,000 and/or jailed up to a year for first-time offenders."
complaints about pigeons,Ms Tin Pei Ling asked the Minister for National Development (a) how many complaints about pigeons have been received by AVA and town councils on average per month over the past year; and (b) what have been done in response to these complaints.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Over the past year, Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA) received about 320 pigeon-related feedback each month. The feedback pertains mainly to the feeding of pigeons and pigeon-related nuisances, e.g. soiling of laundry by pigeon droppings.The management of pigeon-related issues requires a multi-stakeholder approach. AVA enforces against pigeon feeders and NEA enforces against littering offences, which could contribute to food sources for birds. AVA and the Town Councils also conduct pigeon control operations when necessary.In addition, to reduce food supply for the birds, it is important for the Town Councils to maintain the cleanliness of the estates, while NEA ensures good food waste management in food centres and coffee-shops.AVA distributes advisories to residents on the environmental health and hygiene issues caused by pigeons. Members of the public have a role to play by not feeding pigeons, which would result in an increase in the pigeon population and pigeon-related nuisance."
appeals made to hdb for flexibility in application of ethnic integration policy,"Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for National Development (a) how many appeals have been made over the past three years for HDB to exercise flexibility in resale transactions on the ethnic limits under the Ethnic Integration Policy and on what grounds; (b) of these, how many have been rejected; and (c) what are the grounds for such rejections.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Between 2013 and 2015, HDB received about 1,200 appeals for a waiver of the Ethnic Integration Policy. Four in five appeals were not successful. For most of these unsuccessful cases, the applicants did not cite any reasons for their appeals, hence there was no basis to consider their requests. Several also cited reasons like financial difficulty or divorce. While we empathise with these cases, they do not provide sufficient grounds to justify the waiver of the ethnic limits, which are needed to ensure a good mix of residents in our neighbourhoods and public housing estates. Furthermore, HDB's observation is that many flat sellers are still able to secure buyers from eligible ethnic groups given the large volume of resale transactions annually."
plan for vacant land opposite bukit batok mrt station bounded by bukit batok central,"Mr Murali Pillai asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the development and implementation plan for the piece of vacant land directly opposite Bukit Batok MRT station that is bounded by Bukit Batok Central; and (b) whether this land is being safeguarded for the provision of supporting infrastructure and facilities for the growing population in Bukit Batok Neighbourhood 4 and, if so, what are the details of these plans.","Mr Lawrence Wong: The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) and Housing Development Board work together to plan for infrastructure and facilities to meet the needs of residents in each of our towns.In March 2016, URA launched a mixed commercial and residential site under the Government Land Sales Programme at Bukit Batok West Avenue 6, which is within Bukit Batok Neighbourhood 4. The tender for the site was awarded in May 2016. When completed, residents at Bukit Batok Neighbourhood 4 can look forward to a supermarket, a foodcourt and a childcare centre, amongst other retail facilities, at this mixed-use site.The vacant land opposite Bukit Batok MRT is safeguarded for longer-term commercial and residential uses as indicated in URA's Master Plan. The development timeline and details of the site will be announced when the plans are ready."
additional ballot chance for unsuccessful first-timer bto flat applicants for mature estates,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for National Development whether the HDB scheme to allot an additional ballot chance for subsequent applications of first-timer applicants for BTO flats who have been unsuccessful for two or more applications in non-mature estates can be extended to include first-timer applicants for mature estates.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The allotment of an additional ballot chance only applies for first-timer (FT) families applying for BTO flats in the non-mature estates. The intention is to help FT families with more urgent housing needs secure their first home.Extending this to those who have applied for BTO flats in the mature estates may not be as effective, given the high demand for the limited flats in such estates.Flat buyers who wish to purchase flats in the mature estates can consider applying under the various priority schemes, such as the Married Child Priority Scheme, Multi-Generation Priority Scheme or the Parenthood Priority Scheme. Alternatively, they may consider buying a resale flat on the open market. Eligible FT families buying resale flats can receive up to $90,000 in housing grants, comprising the CPF Housing Grant, Additional CPF Housing Grant and Proximity Housing Grant."
relaxation of rules for sale of hdb flats to singles with relatives in mature estates,Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Minister for National Development whether HDB will relax the rules and allow the sale of HDB flats to singles in mature estates if the singles have relatives living in the mature estate.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The housing policy for singles was relaxed in 2013 to allow first-timer singles aged 35 and above to buy a subsidised 2-room Flexi flat in non-mature estates from HDB. Land for public housing in mature estates is limited, and flats offered by HDB are mostly prioritised for families.However, singles aged 55 years and above may apply for a 2-room Flexi flat on a short lease in both non-mature and mature estates from HDB. This flexibility is given to elderly singles to meet their ageing-in-place and/or mutual care and support needs.Younger singles who wish to live in mature estates have the option of applying for an HDB flat with their parents. In addition, they can buy a resale flat in any location on the open market, and enjoy a Proximity Housing Grant of $10,000 if they buy a resale flat to live with their parents."
listing of completed estate upgrading programme and interim estate upgrading programme projects in aljunied grc,"Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for National Development if he can provide an updated listing of completed Estate Upgrading Programme (EUP) and Interim Estate Upgrading Programme (I-EUP) projects in Aljunied GRC, with dates of commencement and completion and a brief description of the nature of works.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Three estates in Aljunied GRC were selected for EUP, namely Serangoon Gardens in Batch 1; Rosyth, Hillside & Kovan in Batch 2; and Charlton Park in Batch 6. The selection of the three estates for EUP was first announced in 2000, 2001 and 2008 respectively, and upgrading was completed in 2004, 2006 and 2014 respectively. The EUP works typically consist of upgrading of park facilities, and improvements to public infrastructure such as footpaths.The I-EUP was conducted over three phases islandwide. All I-EUP works in Aljunied GRC have been completed as at March 2016, and included footpath lightings, notice boards, banner stands, directional signages and rain shelters."
statistics on hdb studio apartments sold by families upon demise of lessee,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development (a) since 1998, how many HDB Studio Apartments have so far been sold by the families upon the death of the lessee; and (b) whether the sale proceeds of the Studio Apartments have been released to the beneficiaries of a deceased's estate who are the children or relatives of the deceased.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Studio Apartments (SAs) were sold on a 30-year lease to eligible senior citizens for occupation. SAs cannot be re-sold on the open market.If the lessee passes away, the SA will be passed to the owner's estate. Family members, if eligible, can continue living in the SA for the remaining lease. Alternatively, the SA can be returned to HDB, and HDB will reimburse the residual lease value to the estate of the deceased owner."
land earmarked for hdb development,"Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for National Development (a) of the land earmarked for HDB development, what is the percentage of undeveloped residential land; and (b) what is the percentage of residential land occupied by flats built in 1986 and before.","Mr Lawrence Wong: About 20% of the land earmarked for HDB residential development by 2030 have not been developed.Of the total land used for HDB residential development today, slightly less than half are occupied by HDB flats built in 1986 and before."
number of singaporeans who have signed advanced medical directives,Mr Low Thia Khiang asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the number of Singaporeans who have signed Advanced Medical Directives (AMDs) each year from 2010 to 2015; (b) what is the total cumulative number of Singaporeans who have signed AMDs; and (c) what is the total cumulative number of cases where healthcare institutions acted on AMDs.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: An Advance Medical Directive (AMD) is a legal document that enables a person to voluntarily and in advance, register his or her wishes not to have any extraordinary life-sustaining treatment to prolong his or her life when the person becomes terminally ill and unconscious or unable to make a rational judgment on his or her own treatment.The AMD was introduced in 1997. A cumulative total of 24,682 Singaporeans made an AMD between 1997 and 2015. During the same period, 10 AMDs were effected.Between 2010 and 2015, the numbers of AMDs made by Singaporeans are as follows:Besides AMDs, Advance Care Planning (ACP) is also available and practised at hospitals. This allows forward planning for end-of-life care arrangements, such as the extent of medical treatment and place of death. Though not legally binding, the care preferences of the person are recorded as a document to guide medical professionals and family members in the care arrangements for the patient. We formally rolled out ACP through the Agency for Integrated Care in 2011. Between then and 2015, about 5,100 Advance Care Plans were completed."
"impact of china's 'one belt, one road' initiative on singapore smes","Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) what is the impact of China's ""One Belt, One Road"" initiative on our small and medium-size enterprises.","Mr S Iswaran: Singapore welcomes China’s ""Belt and Road"" Initiative (B&R), as it is a mutually beneficial initiative that will encourage further economic integration, infrastructural cooperation and people-to-people linkages between countries in the region.A key component of this initiative is the internationalisation of Chinese companies. As a key financial, transportation and trading hub in the region, Singapore is well-positioned to be a base for Chinese enterprises venturing into Southeast Asia. In 2015, Chinese investments into Singapore amounted to US$4.96 billion, an increase of 76.5% from the previous year. To date, more than 6,500 Chinese companies have established their presence in Singapore, almost twice the number of companies five years ago. Singapore companies can benefit from collaboration opportunities with this growing pool of Chinese companies venturing into the region, in sectors such as transport and logistics, mixed-use park developments, construction materials and financing.The B&R initiative will also open up possibilities for Singapore companies in China. Various provinces in China have rolled out infrastructure and development plans to support the initiative, resulting in greater opportunities for Singapore companies in sectors such as information and communications technology (ICT), urban solutions, transport and logistics, as well as infrastructure and related services. A key example of this is the Chongqing Connectivity Initiative (CCI), the third Government-to-Government project between Singapore and China. Under this initiative, Singapore companies can access opportunities and bring on board our expertise in the areas of financial services, aviation, transport & logistics and ICT.The Government is helping our SMEs to prepare themselves to seize these opportunities. For example, companies can seek support from SPRING for capability development efforts in developing innovative technologies, products and services in areas such as environmental management, logistics and engineering services.Companies can also tap on IE Singapore's schemes and initiatives to access opportunities in China and countries along the B&R. The Market Readiness Assistance (MRA) scheme provides broad-based assistance for companies new to internationalisation, while the Global Company Partnership (GCP) scheme provides customised help for companies with more established presence overseas. In 2015, IE Singapore supported 34,000 companies in their internationalisation efforts and over 80% of these companies were SMEs.IE Singapore has recently signed MOUs with the Bank of China, China Construction Bank and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China to provide more financing options for Singapore companies undertaking infrastructure projects along the B&R. IE Singapore also works with Trade Associations and Chambers (TACs) to organise overseas in-market workshops in key target markets, including China. These workshops help SMEs gain first-hand experience of market conditions and facilitate the building of networks with potential local business partners."
holistic assistance for individuals with intellectual disabilities and their caregivers,"Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what measures are being taken to provide holistic assistance for (i) individuals with intellectual disabilities and (ii) their caregivers; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider extending existing subsidies such as the VWO Transport Subsidy Scheme, to cover all persons with disabilities regardless of their financial background.","Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: Persons with Disabilities (PwD)s, including those with intellectual disabilities, are supported through a range of early intervention, education, employment and care services. From the time a child is assessed as special needs, they will be supported through the Early Intervention Programme for Infants and Children (EIPIC) and in the school going years at Special Education (SPED) schools which offer customised education programmes for children with intellectual disability. SPED schools also train and help the transition to employment in the later years.Persons with intellectual disabilities can acquire relevant skills and receive job matching and support services from SG Enable and its Voluntary Welfare Organisation (VWO) partners such as the Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore (MINDS).Persons with intellectual disabilities can also receive a range of care services from Drop-in Disability Programmes, Day Activity Centres (DACs) and home based care. DACs equip persons with disabilities with living skills to enhance their independence. We are in the process of adding 600 new DAC places by 2018 to provide this service.Caregivers hiring a foreign domestic worker (FDW) to care for PwDs requiring assistance with their daily activities are eligible to pay a lower monthly FDW Levy. Caregivers of PwDs with moderate to severe disability can separately receive a monthly FDW Grant should their monthly per capita household income be less than $2,600. In addition to the care services and FDW Levy concession and Grant, caregivers of PwDs can also apply for a Caregivers’ Training Grant each year to attend training on caregiving or self-care skills.Public Transport subsidies are provided to all PwDs today through the Public Transport Concession Scheme and are not means-tested. Under this scheme, all persons with permanent disabilities will receive 25% off bus and train travel. Private transport options such as taxis and dedicated transport are subsidised though the Taxi Subsidy Scheme and the Voluntary Welfare Organisation Transport Subsidies (VWOTS) and these are means-tested. Under the current means test criteria, up to two-thirds of households in Singapore would be able to meet the scheme’s income criteria. Such an approach has enabled us to channel limited resources to persons who need them most.In addition to end-user subsidies, the Ministry has also awarded grants to three transport operators serving persons with disabilities in 2015 to help keep transport cost low for dedicated transport users. The subsidised transport rates offered by funded transport operators are available to all PwDs regardless of their income level."
measures to encourage parents to have more children,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Social and Family Development in support of the Government's policy to encourage more parents to have more children (a) whether the Ministry has considered giving free childcare for Singaporean pre-school children; and (b) how much this will cost the Government if it is implemented.,"Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: We understand that childcare costs are a concern to many young parents. Our approach is for the government to play a strong supporting role by defraying parts of the child-raising costs, including subsidising childcare.Initiatives to help parents manage the costs of child-raising include Baby Bonus, tax benefits, housing grants, and medical grants. In particular, the Government recently enhanced the Child Development Account (or CDA) by introducing the CDA First Step, which provides the first $3,000 of Government contributions, without parents having to save first. CDA funds can be used to pay for education and healthcare needs of the child, including childcare fees.The Early Childhood Development Agency also works to ensure childcare remains affordable for families. This is achieved in two ways.First, centres under the Anchor Operator and Partner Operator schemes are subject to fee caps. Today, over 40% of Singaporean children enrolled in childcare are in these centres, which is a significant increase from about 20% in 2012.Second, through basic and means-tested childcare subsidies which were enhanced in 2013. This allows lower-income families to pay as little as $3 per month. Parents can also use money in their CDAs to pay for the balance of the fees.Through these enhancements, we have significantly increased government spending on early childhood. We spent about $600 million on pre-school related efforts last year, which is more than one and a half times of what we spent in 2012.This approach keeps childcare affordable, while allowing parents to choose from a variety of options according to their preferences. Conversely, provision of free childcare may limit the range of childcare programmes available to parents, and result in a higher burden to taxpayers. It may also have the unintended consequence of driving over-consumption and hence raising demand, so parents truly in need of childcare might find it difficult to secure a place.We will continue to monitor and review our measures to ensure quality childcare remains accessible and affordable, as part of a range of measures to support the parenthood aspirations of Singaporeans."
"subsidies for preschools to train and employ additional manpower for children with speech delay, autism and at risk of moderate or severe disabilities","Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Social and Family Development in light of the higher number of children below the age of seven years with speech delay, autism and at risk of moderate to severe disabilities and the longer waiting time for early intervention services at VWOs, whether the Ministry will consider (i) funding or increasing subsidies to the preschools to train and employ additional manpower similar to the role of a shadow teacher or allied educator in schools and (ii) making recommendations to increase the ratio of teachers to students in preschools who accept these children in the interim.","Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: Today, pre-schools may accept children with mild to moderate developmental delays and who may benefit from integration into the mainstream environment. To support this, the Ministry for Social and Family Development funds the Development Support Programme (DSP) at more than 300 pre-schools. Under DSP, therapists and specially-trained Learning Support Educators (LSEds) provide targeted learning and development for the children, and also work with the main teacher during classes to integrate the child in a group setting. We will expand the DSP to 30 more centres this year.In addition, the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) has been collaborating with training institutes to provide subsidised modular Continuing Professional Development courses to equip pre-school teachers with the skillsets to support pre-school children with developmental needs. Given the diversity of needs, ECDA does not prescribe a specific staff-child ratio for preschools with these children. However, pre-schools with these children are able to deploy more teachers if needed. Pre-schools are also encouraged to work with the child’s parents and developmental specialists for the child’s development.For children with more severe needs, there are currently 17 Early Intervention Programme for Infants and Children (EIPIC) centres supporting some 2,600 children in their developmental needs. The EIPIC centres also support the integration of children into mainstream pre-schools. MSF will increase the capacity to 3,200 places by 2018.Beyond expanding current services, MSF will work with our partners to develop a continuum of services for children with different needs and to train a multi-disciplinary team of pre-school teachers, LSEds, therapists and psychologists to support more children with special needs in the learning environment that is most appropriate for their development."
senior citizens diagnosed and treated for hearing impairment,"Mr Low Thia Khiang asked the Minister for Health (a) between 2013 and 2015, how many senior citizens have been diagnosed with hearing loss requiring the use of hearing aids; (b) how many have applied for subsidies for hearing aids under the Seniors' Mobility and Enabling Fund (SMF); (c) how many have been granted a subsidy for hearing aids; and (d) what is the total amount of subsidy disbursed for hearing aids.","25 Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Health (a) how many elderly Singaporeans are currently suffering from hearing impairment and have gone for treatment at polyclinics and public hospitals; (b) how many of them have received subsidies for hearing aids under the Seniors' Mobility and Enabling Fund (SMF); (c) what is the average amount that seniors have to pay for their hearing aids after the subsidy; and (d) what happens if an elderly person cannot afford to pay for the remaining amount after the subsidy is given.Mr Gan Kim Yong: Between 2013 and 2015, our public hospitals diagnosed about 16,300 Singaporean seniors aged 60 and above with hearing loss requiring the use of hearing aids. Of these, about 5,500 seniors eventually took up the use of a hearing aid. These figures would include seniors who visit polyclinics for hearing loss problems who are referred to specialists at our hospitals for further assessment and prescription. We do not have figures on diagnosed cases at private healthcare institutions.Over the same period, 3,954 seniors applied for subsidised hearing aids under MOH's Seniors' Mobility and Enabling Fund (SMF), with 3,934 seniors (i.e. 99.5% of applicants) eventually received the subsidies. On average, seniors paid about $300 as co-payment, after about $2,700 subsidies from SMF, to purchase a pair of hearing aid. Seniors who have difficulties with the co-payment can approach the medical social workers to apply for further financial assistance. Of the 3,954 seniors, about 640 needy seniors, such as those who are on public assistance or Medifund assistance, received 100% subsidy from SMF for their hearing aids.About 100 seniors with disabilities have also tapped on the Assistive Technology Fund (ATF) and the former Special Assistance Fund (SAF)* under MSF to purchase hearing aids. A total of $10.4 million from the three funds, SMF, ATF and SAF, was disbursed to subsidise seniors for hearing aids between 2013 and 2015.[Note The SAF was closed in 2015 following expansion of coverage and enhancement to the ATF.]"
reviews of standard list of drugs and medications of restructured hospitals,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked the Minister for Health how frequent is the standard list of drugs and medications of restructured hospitals reviewed especially in respect of costs and prices of brands that have become generic.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Our Standard Drug List (SDL) is reviewed annually based on assessments by the Drug Advisory Committee (DAC).The DAC receive applications from public healthcare clinicians for additions to the SDL. In assessing these applications, the DAC may consider research evidence and consult other clinicians. The DAC is guided by three main considerationsa) Whether the drug is essential for the treatment of medical conditions that are important causes of morbidity and mortality in Singapore;b) Whether the drug offers a significant improvement in terms of efficacy and effectiveness, as compared to existing drugs in the SDL; andc) Whether there is sufficient evidence of long term safety and cost-effectiveness of using the drug.Our public healthcare institutions procure generic versions of the drugs where available. As generic drugs are generally cheaper, patients prescribed these generic drugs would benefit from the lower costs."
complaints against licensed moneylenders for unfair contracts and practices,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Law (a) in 2015, how many complaints have been lodged against licensed moneylenders for unfair contracts and practices; (b) what action has been taken by the Ministry as a result of these complaints following the completion of the investigations; and (c) whether the Ministry detects an increasing trend of people borrowing from licensed moneylenders.","Mr K Shanmugam: In 2015, the Registry of Moneylenders received 129 reports lodged by members of public against licensed moneylenders. The reports included complaints on moneylenders charging high fees and interest rates, as well as extending credit in breach of the unsecured credit limits. The Registry also conducts regular inspections on moneylenders so as to ensure that their practices are in compliance with the Moneylenders Act and Rules. Where moneylenders or their officers are found to have committed offences under the Act or Rules, the Registry will take decisive action against them.In 2015, 17 moneylenders were subjected to licensing action, such as revocation of licence and forfeiture of security deposit. Nine moneylenders or officers of moneylending companies were warned or offered composition, while six other such individuals were prosecuted and convicted in court. These included matters that arose from complaints made in 2014.In regulating the moneylending industry, we seek to maintain a balance between protecting borrowers and ensuring that there is reasonable access to credit from licensed sources. Over the last three years, there has been an increasing trend in terms of the value of loans granted by the industry. During the same period, a number of measures were also introduced to strengthen protection for borrowers, such as controls on interest rates and fees which were implemented in 2015. We will be implementing further regulatory changes in the coming months."
review of l-drivers' syllabus at driving centres and schools,Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Minister for Home Affairs given the recent spate of multiple-vehicle pile-ups on our highway (a) how often are reviews made for the L-drivers' syllabus conducted by driving centres and schools so that what is taught is relevant to current road traffic conditions; and (b) how are driving instructors regulated to ensure that they keep up-to-date.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The recent multiple-vehicle pile-ups have mainly been caused by motorists' failure to keep a proper lookout or to maintain proper control of their vehicles. These core driving skills are already included in the driving school syllabus for learner motorists. The syllabus for learner motorists includes both theory and practical components and is designed to teach the basics of driving. The syllabus is regularly reviewed to ensure that it remains up to date with the latest road traffic rules and regulations and the road safety situation. Over the last few years, Traffic Police has updated the syllabus to include new elements such as driving on slope for those learning to drive automatic-transmission motor cars, and emergency braking on wet surfaces and expressway familiarisation for those learning to ride motorcycles.The syllabus is taught by driving instructors who are regulated by the Traffic Police through a licensing regime stipulated under the Road Traffic Act and the Road Traffic (Driving Instructors and Driving Schools) Rules. Driving instructors at the driving schools take an annual Instructors' Skill & Knowledge Evaluation to ensure that they continue to keep up-to-date.Learner motorists have to complete the syllabus and pass the driving test before obtaining a driving licence. Beyond learning driving and passing the driving test, motorists have to continue to drive safely and obey traffic rules when on the road. This is especially relevant in our efforts to improve road safety and reduce accidents. Traffic Police will continue to educate road users and step up enforcement efforts to maintain safety on our roads."
building public library near or at east point,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Communications and Information whether the Ministry will undertake a feasibility study to review if a public library can be built at or near East Point to serve the population in Simei and Changi given that the Tampines and Pasir Ris libraries already serve large residential communities.,"Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim: The National Library Board (NLB) aims to make libraries accessible to Singapore residents.There are currently about 43,000 residents in the Changi-Simei area. Residents in Simei and Changi have access to a network of three public libraries located next to the Tampines, Bedok and Pasir Ris MRT stations. Bedok and Pasir Ris libraries are smaller branch libraries, while the library in Tampines is a regional library with a wide range of services designed to serve the broader eastern region.The population in these areas is increasing. NLB recently studied how to better serve the growing number of residents there, and concluded that the best approach was to upgrade all three libraries. The Pasir Ris Public Library was thus revamped and re-opened in November 2015. The Tampines Regional Library will be expanded to about twice its current size. The Bedok Public Library will be re-developed at the nearby Bedok Integrated Complex, offering more diverse spaces. All residents in the East, including in Simei and Changi, will benefit from these enhancements.In addition, NLB supports community-led initiatives to set up reading corners and community libraries, by training resident volunteers and providing a seed collection of library materials. NLB is currently working with a group of residents to set up a community library in the Changi-Simei area."
edb's performance in attracting foreign investments,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Trade) (a) what has been the performance of EDB in attracting foreign investments from 2011 to 2015; and (b) what is EDB's strategy in attracting foreign investments in the face of Singapore's ageing workforce.,"Mr Lim Hng Kiang: From 2011 to 2015, the Economic Development Board (EDB) secured commitments of S$65 billion in fixed asset investments. These investments are expected to generate total business expenditure per annum of $34 billion, value-added per annum of S$77 billion, as well as create 107,000 jobs when fully implemented.EDB adopts a targeted approach to investment promotion, attracting projects that are in line with Singapore's competitive strengths as well as our constraints in manpower, land and planned international commitments on carbon emissions.Besides attracting new investments, EDB also works closely with other Government agencies to support existing companies in Singapore to strengthen their competitiveness, raise productivity and create good job opportunities for locals. For example, EDB partners the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and the Singapore Workforce Development Agency (WDA) to engage companies on equipping their local workers with the relevant skills for their jobs. Where relevant, companies are also encouraged to redesign jobs to meet the needs of older workers through schemes such as WorkPro which is jointly developed by MOM and WDA."
applications for charity or ipc status,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) in 2015, how many applications have been made for charity or IPC status respectively; (b) of these, how many applications have been approved respectively; and (c) what are the main reasons for rejecting a charity or IPC status application respectively.","Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: In 2015, 86 applications were made for charity status. As at 31 March 2016, 41 of these have been registered as charities and 17 charity applications were rejected. In the same period, 39 applications were made for IPC status. Of these, 30 were granted IPC status and three were rejected. The remaining cases were withdrawn or are still under consideration.Most of the rejected applications for charity registration were unable to meet registration requirements such as having objects which were exclusively charitable. Some were rejected due to the lack of substantive activities, programmes or plans to demonstrate their sustainability. Others were rejected because they did not have clear intended beneficiaries or because their activities did not substantially benefit the community in Singapore.The main reasons for rejecting IPC applications were poor governance, qualified audited financial statements, regulatory non-compliance or because applicants conducted activities which were not wholly beneficial to the community in Singapore."
local businesses' access to obs facilities at coney island,"Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth whether local businesses can access the facilities at the new Outward Bound Singapore (OBS) to be built at Coney Island for their team-building activities as the existing OBS at Pulau Ubin no longer caters to businesses.","Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: The new OBS @ Coney, together with OBS' existing premises on Pulau Ubin, will expand OBS' capacity to provide outdoor adventure training opportunities for every youth as they go through upper secondary school.Our priority in the next few years will be to recruit and train additional quality instructional staff to provide safe and meaningful experiences for all students attending OBS programmes.OBS' priority is to develop resilient youths through shared challenging experiences. Corporates can tap on outdoor adventure providers in the private sector."
"extending mrt downtown line 3 from tampines to pasir ris, punggol, fernvale/jalan kayu and yio chu kang","Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry will consider extending the MRT Downtown Line 3 from Tampines to Pasir Ris, Punggol, Fernvale/Jalan Kayu and Yio Chu Kang.",Mr Khaw Boon Wan: We have planned for residents in the North East region to be served by the upcoming Cross Island Line (CRL). Extending the Downtown Line to the areas cited is not quite appropriate as it is primarily designed to serve the corridor between the East-West Line and North-East Line that does not have access to the MRT network today.
programme on human anatomy and respect for members of the opposite sex for kindergartens,Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Acting Minister for Education (Schools) whether the Ministry will require all kindergartens to run a programme to (i) help students identify what are private body parts and why they should not touch each other inappropriately and (ii) educate them as to whom they should report the matter to when they are inappropriately touched.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: Some pre-schools plan activities and make use of everyday teachable moments to help children learn about body safety, including programmes in partnership with community partners. The Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) is also exploring how pre-schools can be further supported to teach body-safety skills in an age-appropriate manner to children.The Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) and ECDA also have in place a reporting and support system to guide pre-school teachers who have concerns over a child’s safety or suspect child abuse. Pre-school teachers can approach ECDA or MSF for advice on appropriate actions to take.In addition, the Ministry of Education’s Nurturing Early Learners (NEL) Framework includes guidelines for pre-school teachers to help their children develop a positive self-concept and to learn values and socially acceptable behaviours. The NEL Framework covers topics on general safety, and how to help children to talk about their feelings and seek help from adults, including their teachers and parents, when they feel hurt or unsafe."
land gazetted as nature reserves and nature areas,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for National Development (a) what percentage of land is currently gazetted as nature reserves and nature areas respectively; and (b) whether there are plans to increase the number or size of nature reserves or nature areas.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Singapore is a city-state, and unlike other countries with large land mass, Singapore has to accommodate all our needs within limited land. Nonetheless, we recognise the value of these greenery and biodiversity systems and make a constant effort to sustain them. Today, there are four gazetted Nature Reserves and 20 recognised Nature Areas in Singapore. Nature Reserves and Nature Areas make up about 5% and 3% of Singapore’s land area respectively. Together, they occupy about 5,400 hectares. This is a significant size, and is equivalent to about eight Ang Mo Kio towns, or almost half of all housing land in Singapore.In addition to setting aside land for Nature Reserves and Nature Areas, we have been adopting unique solutions to conserve nature in our urban setting. For instance, by incorporating green spaces extensively within our urban environment, we have retained a fascinating diversity of native plant species in our city. We have also weaved nature deep into our heartlands through an extensive network of park connectors, Nature Ways and projects like the Active, Beautiful and Clean Waters Programme. We will continue to look for opportunities to integrate greenery and biodiversity in our urban environment, and create a high quality living environment for all."
private education institutions offering industry-relevant training,Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) how many private education institutions currently offer industry-relevant training.,"Mr Ong Ye Kung: There are 61 private education institutions (PEIs) that offer Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ) training in a range of industries from hospitality to digital animation. In addition, another 18 PEIs offer other industry-related courses supported by Government agencies such as the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) and Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA). These include PEIs such as ST Aerospace Academy and SEED Institute, which offer training in niche fields such as aerospace and early childhood education.PEIs need to work with industry and constantly update its curriculum, to stay relevant. Individuals also need to assess a course carefully before enrolling.To help support individuals in their decision making, the Council for Private Education (CPE) makes available information on a PEI’s registration validity and course offerings on its website. CPE also releases online advisories which provide key facts and guides for prospective students in choosing a PEI, and lists enforcement actions taken against PEIs and/or managers."
utilisation rate of hdb community spaces,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether there have been studies on the utilisation rate of HDB community spaces; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider renting selected community spaces to private property owners that live close to the rented space for the purpose of funerals, subject to reasonable limits on usage and payment of higher charges than those payable by HDB flat owners.","Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB provides a variety of spaces for residents' use, such as precinct pavilions and void decks. From feedback, we know that these community spaces are in demand and popular with residents. They are designed as public spaces for all to enjoy and use freely. So it is not practical to track the utilisation rate of these spaces.In accordance with the Town Councils (Use of Common Property) Rules, the Town Councils (TCs) may issue permits and impose charges, as they consider necessary, for the use of common property for social or communal functions such as weddings or funerals at void decks, open spaces and precinct pavilions.All applicants who wish to apply to use these spaces could approach the relevant TCs who would process such applications, while taking into consideration residents' needs and possible disamenities to residents living in the precinct."
rental rebates for hawkers affected by closure of hawker centres for improvement works,Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether the Ministry will consider offering rental rebates to hawkers who are affected by closure of hawker centres for improvement works to help offset some loss of income; and (b) whether the Ministry will be able to work with the Workforce Development Agency to send hawkers for training that is tailored for them during the shut-down period.,"Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: As part of the maintenance of hawker centres, cyclical repairs and redecorations (R & R) works, including the re-painting of the centre and replacement of fixtures, are carried out by the National Environment Agency or the respective Town Councils every five to seven years. Over a longer term, major works such as the replacement of plumbing, sanitary systems, electrical rewiring, exhaust motors, lifts and escalators, as well as re-roofing may also be carried out.Stall-holders who are directly affected by these works and who are unable to operate their stalls due to the closure of the centres may be given rental remission for the duration of the works.My Ministry will take into consideration the suggestion to facilitate the hawkers attending relevant training during the closure period."
exemption from additional buyer's stamp duty for second property bought on one-for-one exchange,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Finance whether the Ministry will allow buyers who own more than one property to be exempted from the Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty if they buy another property as a one-for-one exchange.,"Mr Heng Swee Keat: The objective of Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty (ABSD) is to moderate demand for residential properties and promote a stable and sustainable property market. As such, we have imposed ABSD on foreigners’ and Singapore Permanent Residents’ residential property purchase, and a Singapore Citizen’s second and subsequent residential property purchase. Therefore, a Singapore Citizen who owns two residential properties and sells one of them to purchase another residential property will be required to pay ABSD on the new purchase."
cases of fraud in productivity and innovation credit scheme,"Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for Finance (a) how many cases has IRAS investigated for fraud under the Productivity and Innovation Credit (PIC) scheme since the inception of the scheme; (b) how many court convictions for PIC fraud have been obtained and what are grant amounts involved in these cases; (c) how many cases of suspected PIC fraud are pending before the courts; and (d) how many and in what percentage of cases in (a), (b) and (c) are consultants the subject of proceedings.","Mr Heng Swee Keat: As at 31 December 2015, Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) investigated 488 cases for fraud under the PIC scheme. To date, eight cases, involving a total of $213,000 of cash payouts, have been prosecuted. Three cases are pending trial. The 11 court cases do not involve consultants."
statistics on eldershield premium payers and payouts,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the current number of ElderShield premium payers; (b) to date, what is the number of people who have received ElderShield payouts; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider setting up a coordinating office to help elders with ElderShield matters such as that of signing up, paying premiums and getting payouts.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: ElderShield is an insurance scheme that provides basic protection against the costs of long-term care arising from severe old-age disability. Depending on the policyholder’s plan, the scheme provides cash payouts of either $300 a month for up to five years, or $400 a month for up to six years.As at end 2015, there were 1.2 million ElderShield policyholders, or about 65% of the resident population aged 40 to 83. Those aged 84 and above would not have qualified for ElderShield as they had exceeded maximum entry age when ElderShield was introduced in 2002. Instead, they can apply for financial assistance under the government-funded Interim Disability Assistance Program for the Elderly (IDAPE) if they meet the income and disability criteria.Since ElderShield was launched in 2002 till end-2015, there have been about 12,500 successful claims, with around $90 million paid out.Today, to ensure participation in the scheme is made as easy as possible, all Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents with Medisave accounts are automatically covered under ElderShield at the age of 40, unless they choose to opt-out. As the scheme is operated by three MOH-appointed insurers (Aviva, Great Eastern and NTUC Income), the insurers will send premium notice letters once a year, before policy renewal. Premiums are usually paid via direct deduction from the policyholder or their family member’s Medisave account. For those without Medisave account when they reach 40 years old, the Central Provident Fund (CPF) Board will send an invitation letter to them to invite them to open a CPF account, so that they could be automatically covered under ElderShield. The insurers are also responsible for responding to queries on premiums and supporting the policyholder through the claims process.MOH will continue to review the processes for ElderShield sign-up, premium payment and claims, including working with other organisations such as the Pioneer Generation Office, to help Singaporeans with ElderShield processes and their long term care needs."
priority seats for the elderly and pregnant women on public transport systems,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the Ministry will consider (i) conducting a campaign or public education on giving up seats for the elderly and pregnant women on public transport systems (ii) taking enforcement action against commuters who take up priority seats; (b) how many complaints have the train operators received about such cases in the past three years; and (c) whether the train operators will make more frequent public announcements on reminding commuters to give up seats to those who need them more.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: In the past three years, SMRT and SBST have received about 130 instances of feedback relating to passengers not giving up their seats.The Land Transport Authority (LTA) and Public Transport Council conduct an annual Graciousness Campaign with the public transport operators. One key message of the campaign is to encourage commuters to give up their seats to those who need them more, such as the elderly and pregnant women. Members of the House may recall Phua Chu Kang and the Dim Sum Dollies extolling commuters to give up their seats. The current campaign features cartoon characters, including one called Stand-Up Stacey. Our survey indicates that the message recall rate of the current campaign is very high - 95%.Changing behaviour takes time but there are encouraging signs. In LTA’s perception survey, the percentage of commuters noticing that people are giving up seats has risen from 42% in 2012 to 63% in 2014. We will continue to push ahead with our efforts to promote gracious behaviour. Hopefully, public education will lead to more sustained improvements in such behaviour, rather than using regulations and fines."
subsidies for diabetes and cervical cancer tests at polyclinics and gp clinics,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry will consider providing higher subsidies for detection tests conducted at polyclinics and GP clinics for diabetes and cervical cancer so as to increase early detection for these diseases.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Health screening plays an important role in helping individuals detect diseases early, and seek treatment to manage these diseases promptly. Screening tests for diabetes and cervical cancer are available at affordable rates through the Health Promotion Board’s (HPB’s) Screen for Life programme. Singaporeans can visit General Practitioner (GP) clinics participating in Screen for Life, to enjoy a package rate of $10 for chronic disease screening (which includes diabetes screening), and $10.25 for cervical cancer screening. Since 2014, individuals who hold the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) or Pioneer Generation (PG) card can receive these tests for free at Screen for Life GPs, and receive subsidies for their doctor’s consultation fee, if they are due for screening. With these subsidies, CHAS and PG patients paid an average of only $2 per visit last year. In addition, eligible Singaporeans can receive subsidised cervical cancer and chronic disease screening at the polyclinics.The Ministry will continue to review these subsidies from time to time to ensure that screenings and follow-up consultations remain affordable for Singaporeans."
detentions under section 160 of women's charter,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) how many women and girls have been detained in the last five years under section 160 of the Women's Charter; and (b) in each of the last five years what has been the longest and mean duration of detention respectively.,"Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: Under Section 160 of the Women’s Charter, the Director of Social Welfare can admit a woman or girl below the age of 21 years into a place of safety for reasons such as ill treatment or moral danger. The Director of Social Welfare must be satisfied that doing so is in their best interest.Each of such cases will be thoroughly investigated by MSF within a month of placement. To ensure that the women and girls do not remain in the place of safety unnecessarily, an independent Discharge Committee reviews such cases every six months.Over the last five years, a total of 10 women and girls were admitted. Three of them were discharged within a month after the investigations. Seven continued their stay at the places of safety mainly because of continued protection concerns and lack of suitable caregivers. The mean duration of stay was two years, while the longest was for four years."
enforcement action against unlicensed tour guides,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (a) how many unlicensed tour guides has the Ministry taken enforcement action against from 2013 to date; and (b) what are the measures that the Ministry have and will be taking to regulate against unlicensed tour guides from diluting the quality of tour guide services in Singapore.,"Mr S Iswaran: The Singapore Tourism Board (STB) takes a serious view against unlicensed tourist guides. The STB (Amendment) Act 2014, which came into effect in October 2014, strengthened the powers to investigate and compound offences by STB enforcement officers and increased the penalties for unlicensed guiding offences, to more effectively deter illegal tourist guiding activities.Over the past few years, STB has stepped up enforcement action against unlicensed tourist guides. Enforcement checks have increased by more than five times from 225 in 2013 to 1,245 in 2015. Since 2013, one licensed travel agent and its director were convicted and fined for engaging unlicensed tour guides to conduct tours, while six unlicensed tourist guides were convicted and fined $1,500 or more for each offence.STB will continue to closely monitor the situation and take firm action against companies and individuals who do not comply with the regulatory requirements."
use of caregivers training grant,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Health (a) in the past year, how many caregivers who have benefitted from the Caregivers Training Grant are specialised caregivers who provide care for specific illnesses or disabilities; (b) how much do the specialised caregivers receive on average; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider increasing the grant quantum for specialised caregivers.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Caregivers’ Training Grant was introduced in 2007 to support caregivers of seniors who are 65 years or older and persons with disabilities with up to $200 each year to attend caregiver training courses. To date, more than 32,000 caregivers have benefited from this grant.In FY2015, caregivers who used the grant to attend courses pertaining to conditions such as dementia, autism, dyslexia or intellectual disabilities made up about 40% of the 6,000 caregivers who have used the grant to-date. The average annual utilisation by these caregivers was $116 per grant recipient in FY2015.We do not have plans to increase the grant quantum at the moment, as the current grant of $200 per annum is generally adequate. Today, about 80% of all approved caregiver training courses cost $200 or less. The average annual utilisation per grant recipient has remained at about $160 for the past five years.We will continue to monitor the adequacy of the grant."

vehicles and stations under car-sharing scheme,Miss Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the current number of vehicles and stations under the car-sharing scheme; (b) what has been the utilisation rate; and (c) whether there are plans to increase the number of car-sharing vehicles and locations.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: There are currently three operators running car-sharing schemes, with about 300 cars amongst them. The Government supports them by making available to them lots in Government-managed car parks. The Housing and Development Board has allocated more than 300 car park lots for their use.The utilisation rate is competitive information for the operators. However, they have shared that it is healthy, growing, and tends to be higher during weekends and public holidays.The Land Transport Authority and the Economic Development Board are currently evaluating proposals from car-sharing operators for an electric vehicle car-sharing programme that will see up to 1,000 electric cars deployed nationwide within 10 years."
maternity leave for single mothers,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Social and Family Development whether the Government will consider increasing the amount of maternity leave for single mothers considering that they need more time to take care of their children.,"Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: Currently, single unwed mothers are eligible for eight and four weeks of paid and unpaid maternity leave, respectively.We are in the midst of reviewing the support provided to single unwed parents, as part of the Ministry’s efforts to better support children from vulnerable families. We will announce the outcome of our review soon."
review of additional housing grant,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry will be reviewing the Additional Housing Grant which was last enhanced in 2009.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The Additional CPF Housing Grant (AHG) Scheme was introduced in March 2006 to help low-income families own their first home. The AHG can be used to buy a new flat from HDB or a resale flat from the open market.We have enhanced the AHG twice – first in August 2007 and then in February 2009, to benefit more households and to increase the subsidy amount. Today, first-timers earning up to $5,000 a month can apply for the AHG of up to $40,000. Since the Scheme was introduced, $1.6 billion has been given out to more than 83,000 households. There are no immediate plans to further enhance the AHG Scheme.On top of the AHG, first-timers buying a new flat can also receive the Special CPF Housing Grant (SHG). We recently enhanced the SHG in August 2015 to include households earning up to $8,500, and doubled the maximum grant quantum to $40,000. This means that eligible first-timer families can now receive up to $80,000 in housing grants when they buy a new flat from HDB.Meanwhile, we also introduced the Proximity Housing Grant (PHG) of $20,000 in August 2015 to help families buying a resale flat live closer to their parents or married child for mutual care and support. Together with the AHG and the CPF Housing Grant of $30,000, eligible first-timer families can now receive a total of $90,000 in housing grants when they buy a resale flat.We will continue to ensure that public housing remains affordable, and are prepared to do more if necessary."
appeals for public rental flats and interim rental housing,"Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for National Development for each year between 2013 and 2015 (a) how many cases of appeals have been received from the respective Members of Parliament on behalf of their residents for public rental flats and interim rental housing respectively; (b) of the total number of appeals, what is the number of successful appeals; (c) what are the main considerations for favourably granting these appeals; and (d) whether for complex cases, referrals will be made to Family Service Centres or voluntary welfare organisations to have the respective cases further assessed before a decision on their appeals are made.","Mr Lawrence Wong: From 2013 to 2015, HDB received requests from around 8,700 appellants a year for public rental flats. These included appeals made through Members of Parliament and appeals made directly to HDB.Over this same period, a total of 6,900 households were successful in their requests for public rental flats. Another 510 households were assisted with Interim Rental Housing.HDB assesses each appeal on its own merit. For needy households who do not meet the eligibility criteria, HDB will exercise flexibility and offer public rental if they are unable to buy a flat, and have no other housing options or family support.HDB may also refer complex cases to a Family Service Centre (FSC) for a social worker’s assessment if the client consents. Apart from exploring their housing options, HDB will then work with the social service agencies to help the families with counselling, financial assistance and employment support to address the underlying causes of housing instability."
breakdown of account balances by gender of cpf members,Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for Manpower how does the average CPF balances of members vary by gender and what is the breakdown of gender differences by the respective age groups.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: In 2015, the average net CPF balances1 of males and females across all ages was $86,000 and $76,000 respectively. The difference between male and female CPF balances has narrowed from 21% in 2005 to 14% in 2015.Table 1 shows the male-to-female ratio of average net CPF balances across different age groups. The male-to-female ratio is lower for younger age groups and increases for older age groups."
productivity growth of government over 10 years,Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for Finance about (a) the productivity growth of the Government over the last 10 years and (b) the areas which showed the most improvement.,"Mr Heng Swee Keat: The Public Service is constantly seeking to be more productive, doing more with the same or less resources, and ensuring that we continue to be effective and efficient in delivering our services. However, unlike the private sector, it is difficult to measure productivity growth in public services, as the outcomes achieved and value created from the diverse range of public services are often intangible and not easily quantifiable.Nevertheless to give a sense of the numbers, our population and real GDP grew by 2.6% and 5.3% per annum on average over the past 10 years. During the same period, we have maintained our public sector manpower growth at an average of 1.8% per annum to serve the population and support the economy. The lower public sector headcount growth is a result of a deliberate policy to constrain Ministries’ headcount growth under the Manpower Management Framework. As a result, the public sector’s share of the total labour force has also decreased from 4.30% in 2006 to 3.97% in 2015. This is one of the lowest internationally; it is the same as that in Hong Kong (4%) and lower than in countries such as New Zealand (7%) and the UK (12%) -- in all these cases, the numbers exclude defence personnel.To drive productivity and innovation in the Public Service, our agencies have been tapping on technology and ICT extensively. Compared to 10 years ago, there are now more e-services on multiple channels, which have made it more convenient and efficient for both the users as well as for the agencies. For example, through electronic tax-filing and the no-filing scheme, IRAS has saved time for taxpayers. It was also able to redeploy 100 officers to doing new and other areas of work, despite the tax base growth of 32% from 2009 to 2014. Another example would be ACRA’s Bizfile which has enabled businesses to be registered and companies to be incorporated online in just 15 minutes or less, compared to the manual process which would have taken 24 hours for businesses and five days for companies.We have also sought to drive productivity gains through organisational restructuring. For example, we setup the Municipal Services Office (MSO) in 2014 to improve the Government’s overall coordination and delivery of municipal services; often, these services involve multiple agencies. Since its establishment, MSO has worked with these agencies to improve inter-agency work flows, processes and SOPs to reduce the average time taken to respond to feedback, especially for complex cases. MSO has also worked with agencies to improve the adoption of structured digital channels such as mobile apps and web portals. This has allowed feedback to be routed quickly and automatically to the correct agency for attention.Beyond tapping on IT and organisational restructuring, we have also started to harness data analytics to innovate and improve services. For example, the National Library Board analysed borrowing data to understand library users and their borrowing behavior. This has enabled the NLB to determine the type and number of books it should purchase, and improve its mix of book collections to make library services better."
role of district mayors given transfer of functions to social service offices,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Prime Minister (a) what is the role of district Mayors in the respective Community Development Councils (CDC) and whether their role is still relevant given that the ComCare assistance programmes have been transferred to the Social Service Offices under the care of the Ministry of Social and Family Development; and (b) what is the annual income of a Mayor.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing (for the Prime Minister): The Community Development Councils (CDCs) were set up in 1997 to foster community bonding and strengthen social cohesion in Singapore.The Mayor, as the Chairman of the CDC, plays a key role in strengthening the social infrastructure in the community. The CDCs bring together various community stakeholders across the 3P (people, public and private) sectors to serve the residents in each District. This engenders community ownership and builds community resilience. For example, by partnering the Law Society, CDCs have provided residents with greater accessibility to legal advice, and better awareness of legal issues through legal talks by pro bono lawyers. By partnering the National Arts Council (NAC), the CDCs have made arts programmes more accessible to the vulnerable. By working with SPRING Singapore and the Business Associations to set up the five Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SME) Centres@CDCs, the CDCs have helped to promote greater awareness of the Government’s help schemes for and offer business advice to SMEs.In the same spirit, the CDC mobilises the local resources of community and corporate organisations to complement the national assistance schemes to meet the needs of the residents. For example at North East (NE) District, the NE CDC coordinates among Grassroots Organisations, Social Service Offices and Workforce Development Agency to help the residents achieve self-reliance from receiving financial assistance to getting employment. In 2015, the CDCs helped over 100,000 beneficiaries.Mayors are appointed by the Chairman of PA who is the Prime Minister. Each Mayor is in charge of a District where the number of residents in the District is not less than 500,000. As chairman of the CDC, the Mayor maintains the focus of the CDCs to serve the residents and ensures the efficient running of the CDC. He / She advises the PA Board on matters affecting the well-being of the residents in the District, the provision and use of public facilities and services within the District. From time to time, they will be asked to represent Singapore at official international conventions or meetings in their capacity as Mayors.Mayors hold responsibilities which are comparable in scale and complexity to that of office holders at the Ministries. The norm annual salary of a Mayor is $660,000, pegged between the salary range of a Senior Parliamentary Secretary and that of a Minister of State. A Mayor who also holds a concurrent appointment in the Ministry will only receive one salary."
property pledges by cpf members to allow for fund withdrawal beyond basic retirement sum,"Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for Manpower (a) in 2016 so far, what is the number of CPF members who choose to pledge their properties in order to withdraw their Retirement Account savings above their Basic Retirement Sum; and (b) how much of the amount withdrawn has been used to top up their spouses' CPF accounts.","Mr Lim Swee Say: CPF members aged 55 and above can withdraw their Retirement Account savings above their Basic Retirement Sum if they have a sufficient existing charge on their property. Those who do not have a sufficient existing property charge can still make such a withdrawal after making a pledge on their property. This property charge or pledge does not affect the ownership of the property and is intended to ensure that the member’s Retirement Account is restored up to the Full Retirement Sum if the property is sold in the future.In January and February 2016, 1,200 CPF members withdrew their Retirement Account savings above their Basic Retirement Sum through a property charge or pledge. 700 of them turned 55 in January and February 2016 and became eligible to make such withdrawals. These members had withdrawn their Retirement Account savings in cash. We do not track whether any of them subsequently make cash top-ups to their spouses' CPF accounts.CPF members can also directly transfer their CPF savings above their Basic Retirement Sum to their spouse’s Special or Retirement Account, without the need for a property charge or pledge."
review full-day bus lane implementation,"Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the Ministry will consider imposing the full-day bus lane traffic rule only for stretches of roads which face heavy congestion, instead of all bus lanes in the city area as per the current regulations; and (b) whether taxis will be allowed to pick up and alight passengers along roads marked for bus lanes during bus lane operation hours, as vehicles providing public transportation services.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Not all bus lanes in the city area are full-day bus lanes. Only roads with high bus volumes throughout the day have full-day bus lanes.Allowing taxis to stop within bus lanes during operation hours will hamper bus speeds and timeliness, to the detriment of many bus commuters."
extension of operating hours of mrt station pedestrian walkways,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for Transport whether the underground pedestrian walkway at the Potong Pasir and other affected MRT stations can remain open for public use even after the MRT stations have stopped their operations in the early morning hours.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Pedestrian links are kept open round the clock for the convenience of pedestrians. This is the default position, unless there are strong reasons not to do so.In the case of Potong Pasir MRT Station, the underground pedestrian link leads directly to the station’s platform. If it is kept open after MRT operating hours, it can pose security issues such as vandalism of station property."
reason for delay in completion of sheltered linkway at woodleigh close,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the reason for the delay in completion of the sheltered linkway at Woodleigh Close under the Walk2Ride programme; and (b) what is LTA's estimated date of completion of these works.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: It was originally estimated that the sheltered linkway at Woodleigh Close would be completed by May 2016. Since then, Land Transport Authority (LTA) has found that it needs more time to ensure that the linkway’s construction does not affect existing utilities infrastructure and adjacent trees. The expected completion date is now August 2016."
illegal parking at taxi stands,Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for Transport (a) how many cases of illegal parking or misuse of taxi stands and taxi stops have there been over the last three years; (b) what is the breakdown in terms of the number of such cases committed by taxis and non-taxis; and (c) what efforts will the Ministry embark on to reduce such cases.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Over the last three years, there were 4,329 cases of illegal parking at and misuse of taxi stands and taxi stops. Of these, 325 were committed by taxis.The Land Transport Authority (LTA) will continue to deploy enforcement officers to deter motorists from misusing taxi stands and taxi stops."
justification for building sheltered pedestrian overhead bridges,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the reason why some pedestrian overhead bridges are sheltered while others are not; and (b) whether shelter can be provided for the pedestrian overhead bridge at Braddell Road near Carmichael Road and its linked walkways to the surrounding bus stops.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: In building shelters for pedestrian overhead bridges, Land Transport Authority (LTA) prioritises those bridges that are more frequently used. We will review the case for the bridge at Braddell Road."
sole tenancy of public rental housing,"Mr Alex Yam asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the breakdown of categories of exceptions made for sole tenancy of public rental housing over the last five years, (b) how many rentals of single-tenanted flats are due to disputes between tenants; and (c) whether there is a potential loophole where tenants create a living atmosphere that is detrimental to potential co-tenants.","Mr Lawrence Wong: There are currently two broad categories of public rentals - those who apply as a family unit, and those apply as a singles under the Joint Singles Scheme (JSS). For the families staying in rental flats, HDB will typically exercise flexibility in allowing the tenant to stay on as sole occupant in the event of the passing of a family member. For the JSS, the tenant will have to find another person to stay together, if his co-tenant passes away or withdraws from the tenancy. However, on a case-by-case basis, HDB does make exceptions for JSS rental tenants to live alone. These are mostly due to medical reasons, for instance having illnesses that leave them with low immunity to infections.There are currently about 2,000 flats occupied by only one tenant under the JSS. Their co-tenants withdrew from the tenancy for various reasons, including marriage, death or having found alternative accommodation, and not necessarily due to disputes. HDB does not keep specific records of the reasons for the co-tenants' withdrawal.Tenants are given six months to find another co-tenant. We encourage them to look for someone they know, like a relative or friend. HDB also provides them with a list of single applicants, or introduces them to other single tenants of a similar profile, whom they may contact before mutually agreeing to jointly rent a flat.If a rental tenant creates a living environment that makes joint occupation difficult, HDB can take action against the tenant under the Tenancy Agreement, including not allowing further renewal of their tenancy, and recovering the rental flat as a last resort."
personal protection orders and family violence cases,"Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) in each of the last five years, how many applications for personal protection orders have the Family Justice Courts received; (b) how many orders have been issued; and (c) what is the breakdown of the orders issued in terms of the family relationship between the complainant and respondent.","14 Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) in each of the last five years, how many cases of family violence have the Family Services Centres and the Family Violence Specialist Centres handled; and (b) what is the breakdown of the cases in terms of the family relationship between the abuser and victim.Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: Victims affected by family violence may seek assistance and support at various touch points, including MSF-funded Family Service Centres (FSCs) and Family Violence Specialist Centres (FVSCs). Family violence may co-exist with other issues such as family and marital disputes.Over the last five years, FSCs reported an average of 1,400 cases annually where family violence was one of the presenting problems. FSCs may refer cases to the three FVSCs for more specialised intervention. Victims can also approach the FVSCs directly. In recent years, FVSCs have worked on an average of 900 family violence cases annually.Persons who require legal protection in addition to community support can apply for a Personal Protection Order (PPO) at the Family Justice Courts. Over the last five years, the Family Justice Courts received an average of about 3,000 PPO applications annually. An average of 1,200 applications (or about 40% of applications) were issued with an order each year. The remaining applications were withdrawn, struck out or dismissed. The details are provided in Table 1.On average, 72% of the PPOs issued were made against the applicant’s spouse or former spouse (mainly husband or ex-husband). About 11% of orders were made against children/children-in-law. Orders made against siblings, parents and other relatives made up the rest. While detailed breakdowns are not available for the FSC and FVSC cases, the profiles are broadly similar."
funding given to schools,"Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Acting Minister for Education (Schools) for each of the years from 2013 to 2015, what is the lowest and highest amount of funding given to schools, broken down by primary, secondary, and independent schools.","Mr Ng Chee Meng: MOE resources schools, based on the needs of their students, the programmes that they offer, and their enrolment, so that each school has adequate resources to develop the students under its charge. As such, resourcing can vary, both across different groups of schools as well as between schools within each group. It would not be meaningful to make comparisons based on the amount of funding given to each school.At the broader level, the Government remains committed to invest in all schools to develop our students fully and holistically. The Government's investment in education, as reflected in the funding for the operating expenses per student, or per capita funding per student, increased from 2013 to 2015.The per capita funding of primary education was $8,500 in FY2013 and $9,700 in FY2015. For a secondary student, the funding was $11,400 in FY2013 and $13,400 in FY2015. For independent schools4, the per capita funding was $14,100 in FY2013 and $14,700 in FY2015. Within the group of independent schools, the specialised schools like NorthLight School, Assumption Pathway School, Crest Secondary School and Spectra Secondary School received the highest per capita funding support from MOE. On average, in FY2015, these four specialised schools received funding at $25,900 per capita, enabling them to provide the specialised support and programmes to meet the needs of their students."
population of stray animals,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for National Development in each of the past five years (a) what is the estimated population of stray dogs, stray cats and wild monkeys respectively; (b) what is the number of stray dogs, stray cats and wild monkeys respectively which have been culled; and (c) what is the number of stray dogs, stray cats and wild monkeys respectively which have been trapped and subsequently re-homed or relocated.","Mr Lawrence Wong: The estimated populations of stray dogs, stray cats and wild monkeys are about 7,000, 60,000 and 1,900 respectively.AVA is the first responder agency on animal matters. When there are safety concerns from the public, AVA has to impound the stray animals. AVA works closely with animal welfare groups to rehome the animals, if they are deemed suitable. Those which are not rehomed, including the aggressive and sick animals, will be humanely euthanised as a last resort.The AVA annual report contains the number of stray animals that are impounded and rehomed annually. Last year, AVA euthanised 942 dogs, 888 cats and 623 monkeys. At the same time, AVA rehomed 265 dogs and 129 cats. AVA will continue to work with animal welfare groups to rehome stray animals."
physical education lessons in schools,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Acting Minister for Education (Schools) how many hours of Physical Education lessons do school children have currently and whether this is adequate.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: As announced in 2010, Physical Education (PE) has been increased to 2-2.5 hours per week, from 1-1.5 hours per week.During PE, students acquire movement competencies, health-related knowledge and sports skills, and understand the value of physical activities and keeping fit. Schools also organise recreational sports competitions, sports carnivals and outdoor camps to supplement PE.With these knowledge, skills and values, students will have the capability to participate and enjoy a wide variety of physical activities and sports outside of school hours and beyond their schooling years."
paternity and childcare leave policies,Mr Desmond Choo asked the Prime Minister (a) whether the Government will consider legislating (i) a second week of paternity leave for fathers and (ii) an increased share of maternity leave that mothers can share with their husbands; and (b) what are the measures or incentives that the Government is further considering to implement to improve the participation rate by companies to provide paternity leave.,"2 Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Prime Minister (a) whether the Government will be reviewing childcare leave policies; (b) whether it will consider increasing the amount of extended childcare leave; and (c) whether it will consider pegging the amount of childcare leave to not only the age of the children but also the number of children one has.Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): The Government is strongly committed to supporting Singaporeans in their marriage and parenthood aspirations. Leave is one of the range of measures to support parenthood and like many other countries, Singapore has legislated leave provisions to support parents’ infant and child caregiving needs. These provisions have been progressively enhanced over the years to help parents better manage both their work and family commitments.Childcare leave provisions were increased in 2008 from two days to six days per parent per year, for those with children below the age of seven. We extended these provisions further in 2013 so that parents with children aged seven to 12 can also enjoy two days of Government-paid childcare leave each year.Parents with more children are able to enjoy the annual childcare leave entitlement of six days per parent for a longer period of time, until their youngest child has turned seven years old. They continue to enjoy two days of childcare leave per parent per year, until their youngest child is aged 13.Beyond this, we have also enhanced our leave schemes to enable fathers to play an active role in raising their children. International studies have shown that children with more involved fathers have better physical, cognitive and emotional developmental outcomes. Greater paternal involvement in child-raising also helps mothers to stay active in the workforce.In 2013, we introduced one week of legislated Government-paid Paternity Leave, as well as one week of Government-paid Shared Parental Leave, which allows fathers to share a week of their spouses’ Maternity Leave entitlement. This is in addition to unpaid infant-care leave of one week which both parents may take.Last year we enhanced Government-paid Paternity Leave by an additional week, which employers may offer voluntarily. Taken together with infant-care and childcare leave provisions, fathers can enjoy up to five weeks of leave upon the birth of their child to bond with their new-borns and care for their wives2.In considering whether to provide parents with more leave to care for their children, we are mindful of the possible impact on businesses’ operational and manpower needs. In particular, given that childcare leave is provided for 12 years after birth, we are careful not to inadvertently affect parents’ employability. Further enhancements to these leave provisions have to be considered, balancing both the needs of parents and concerns of employers and employees.This is why the second week of Government-paid Paternity Leave was introduced on a voluntary basis. The Government is now considering when to legislate the second week of Paternity Leave, with a view to providing a reasonable amount of time for businesses to make the necessary adjustments.At the same time, some parents have provided feedback that they would like more flexibility for mothers to share their Maternity Leave entitlement with fathers, even as overall leave provisions remain unchanged. This would enable fathers to play a larger role in caring for their new-borns, and allow parents to decide flexibly how best to care for the child according to their family circumstances. We are considering this proposal carefully.The Government will continue to encourage companies to do their part by providing a family-friendly work environment, including the provision of flexible work arrangements (FWAs). Such measures can also help employers to attract and retain talent. Employers can tap on the Work-Life Grant administered by Ministry of Manpower, under which eligible companies can receive up to $160,000 to help them defray the costs of developing, piloting and sustaining FWAs."
corruption trend,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Prime Minister (a) what is the trend of corruption in Singapore over the past five years; (b) whether the trend is expected to rise in the near future; and (c) why is there a need to set up the Corruption Reporting Centre at Whitley Road.,"Mr Chan Chun Sing (for the Prime Minister): In the five-year period from 2010 to 2014, the number of corruption complaints received and cases registered for investigations by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) have remained stable.The CPIB will be releasing its latest annual corruption statistics in April 2016. This will incorporate latest corruption statistics from the year 2015.The Corruption Reporting Centre at Whitley Road, which will be co-located with CPIB's Heritage Gallery, is set up to provide an accessible and convenient platform outside of the CPIB Headquarters for members of the public to make corruption-related complaints or to find out more information about corruption.Based on CPIB's statistics, complaints lodged in person are significantly more pursuable and are three times more likely to result in investigation compared with other modes of complaints such as through phone calls or written correspondence. This new facility will provide an additional access point for members of the public to come forward with information on suspected graft cases."
accidents involving e-bikes,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Transport for each of the years from 2010 to 2015, what is the number of accidents involving e-bikes that have been reported.",Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The number of road accidents involving power-assisted bicycles from 2010 to 2015 is in Table 1 below.
basis of yearly medisave claim limits,Ms Foo Mee Har asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the basis upon which the yearly Medisave claim limits are set; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider allowing Singaporeans suffering from chronic illnesses to fully fund their medical bills using their Medisave.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Medisave withdrawal limits are set such that basic, subsidised healthcare expenses are affordable for all Singaporeans, after taking into account government subsidies, and MediShield Life payouts where applicable. These withdrawal limits are reviewed regularly.Under the Chronic Disease Management Programme (CDMP), Singaporeans can use up to $400 per Medisave account per year to pay for their chronic disease treatment. 19 chronic conditions are covered under CDMP, which accounts for more than 90% of chronic attendances seen at polyclinics today. In 2014, the $400 CDMP limit was sufficient for about eight in 10 subsidised patients with common chronic conditions. In addition, affordability will improve further with the introduction of Flexi-Medisave in 2015, where elderly Singaporeans can use an additional $200 per patient per year to pay for their outpatient treatments, including for chronic conditions, at public healthcare institutions and participating CHAS GP clinics.Medisave withdrawal limits are necessary to avoid premature depletion of limited Medisave savings, which were mostly sized for inpatient treatment. Nonetheless, we understand the needs of patients with chronic illnesses. Hence, we carefully set the Medisave limits, to strike a balance between their ongoing chronic treatment needs and their future needs such as hospitalisation and insurance premiums. Therefore, it would not be prudent to allow patients to use Medisave to fully pay for all their medical bills for chronic illnesses, regardless of amount. However, for patients whose bills exceed the $400 cap, they can use the Medisave of their family members to pay, or apply for Medifund at the polyclinics or subsidised specialist outpatient clinics in public hospitals if they face financial difficulties.We will continue to monitor the affordability of subsidised care, especially for chronic diseases, and ensure that the Medisave withdrawal limits continue to be sufficient."
"government bodies oursourcing it, hr, customer contact centre functions","Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Finance (a) how many Government bodies have outsourced their IT, HR, customer contact centre or other functions to private sector shared service providers; and (b) in cases where the outsourced facility remains in Singapore, whether Government agencies routinely take into consideration the salaries of those employed in such outsourced facilities versus the salaries earned by civil servants performing the same function before the outsourcing as one consideration in awarding the outsourcing tender.","Mr Heng Swee Keat: Government agencies may outsource certain functions because (a) it is more efficient to do so to reap economies of scale, and/or (b) the private sector has the professional expertise and resources to better perform the functions.This approach allows Government agencies to focus on its key priority of public service delivery, and tap into private sector expertise, experiences and resources, when needed. For instance, Government agencies requiring infocomm technology services may either be supported by the Infocomm Development Authority (IDA), or have a core in-house IT unit augmented by the private sector to develop and maintain more specialised IT systems.When outsourcing, agencies will typically procure services through an open tender. The award decision will be based on quality factors such as the tenderer’s track record, innovative solutions, and technical competencies, in addition to the price competitiveness of the bid.While it is not a government practice to scrutinise the salary terms of their outsourced suppliers, the suppliers are expected to comply with the existing labour laws. For sectors such as cleaning, security and landscape services, the Government has committed to buying only from providers that pay their workers according to the Progressive Wage Model."
extending wage credit scheme,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Finance whether the Ministry will consider (i) extending the Wage Credit Scheme beyond 2017 in light of the global economic slowdown and (ii) increase the quantum of 20% co-funding by the Government.,"Mr Heng Swee Keat: The Wage Credit Scheme (WCS) was introduced in Budget 2013, as part of a Transition Support Package, to help businesses cope with rising wage costs in a tight labour market, so that they can free up resources to invest in productivity and share the productivity gains with employees. Under this scheme, the Government co-funds 40% of wage increases for Singaporean employees earning gross monthly wages of $4,000 and below, over the period 2013 to 2015.To provide more time for firms to restructure, the WCS was extended in 2015 for another two years from 2016 to 2017. This was in recognition that some businesses may require more time to adjust to rising business and wage costs. The support level was reduced to 20% to avoid Government support becoming a crutch even as we extended help to ease the transition within a tight labour market.In the past few years, we have also stepped up targeted support for restructuring, through enhancements to schemes such as the Capability Development Grant and the Partnership for Capability Transformation. We will continue to monitor business conditions closely and calibrate our support for businesses, taking into account both short-term cost concerns and the need to sustain the impetus for restructuring."
extending parent-care and childcare leave schemes to family care,"Dr Tan Wu Meng asked the Prime Minister whether the Public Service Division will consider (i) extending parent-care and childcare leave schemes to include family care for other immediate family members such as siblings, grandparents and children above 12 who require care and attention; and (ii) increasing the total number of days of such leave.","Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): As an employer, the Public Service provides family-care leave for our officers, separate from their vacation leave. Our officers enjoy up to 15 days of childcare leave, two weeks of paternity leave, four months of maternity leave and two days of parent-care leave. Where the job allows, our officers may also apply for flexible arrangements in the forms of staggering their work hours, telecommuting or working part-time.We have progressively enhanced our family-care leave benefits over the years. We introduced two days of parent-care leave in 2012. In 2015, we took the lead to enhance paternity leave from one week to two weeks ahead of national legislation.As a large employer in Singapore, any change we make to our family-care leave benefits will put pressure on private sector employers to follow suit. Even as we support pro-family initiatives, we will have to carefully consider the implication of more generous family-care leave benefits on private sector business cost and on the employability of private sector workers."
breakdown of new citizens,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Home Affairs if he can provide a breakdown of the number of new citizens each year between 2006-2015 listed according to their previous nationality prior to becoming Singapore citizens.,"Mr K Shanmugam: From 2006 to 2015, an average of 18,795 persons was granted Singapore citizenship (SC) annually. Of this, the significant majority came from Asia, mainly from Southeast Asia.In 2013, in answer to Ms Sylvia Lim in Parliament, DPM Teo Chee Hean had said ""In some cases, we provide aggregated information or data instead of a more detailed breakdown because it may not be in our interest to do so. It may have implications on specific groups of persons or create sensitivities in the countries of origin for those who are working here or those who have migrated here… For similar reasons, we provide data on the number of immigrants by broad categories of the regions they have come from but have not provided the detailed breakdown of immigrants by specific countries of origin. I think Members understand that there may be some sensitivity with regard to this.""That remains the position. Disclosing a detailed breakdown of the data may, among other issues, have implications/sensitivities for specific groups of persons, and create sensitivities in the countries of origin."
companies benefitting from flexi-work arrangements incentive under work-life grant,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how many companies have benefited from the Flexi-Work Arrangements Incentive under the Work-Life Grant; (b) how many of the companies are SMEs; and (c) how many Singaporean employees are utilising Flexi-Work Arrangements in these companies.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: The proportion of employers with at least 25 employees providing at least one form of flexible work arrangement (FWA) has steadily increased from 28% in 2008 to 47% in 2014. The FWA Incentive under the Work-Life Grant was introduced in April 2013 to support employers who are able to sustain regular utilisation of FWAs for more than 20% of their employees.As of December 2015, 224 applications have been received. A large majority, about 95%, of the applications were from SMEs.SMEs would typically take a year or more to track and monitor the FWA utilisation. So far, a quarter of the applicants have claimed the FWA Incentive, covering about 900 Singaporean employees3."
companies benefitting from developmental grant under work-life grant,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how many companies have benefited from the Developmental Grant under the Work-Life Grant since the scheme was started; (b) how many of the companies are SMEs; and (c) how many of the companies have formalised the Flexi-Work Arrangements.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: More employers are now adopting flexible work arrangements (FWAs) such as flexi-time, flexi-place and/or flexi-load for their employees. The proportion of employers with at least 25 employees providing at least one form of FWA has steadily increased from 28% in 2008 to 47% in 2014. The Developmental Grant under the Work-Life Grant was launched to help defray the implementation costs of formal adoption of FWAs.From the launch of the Development Grant in April 2013 to December 2015, there have been 325 applications. A large majority, about 95%, of the applications were from SMEs. SMEs would typically require a year or more to pilot and formalise FWAs. So far, 39 companies have formalised FWAs and claimed the grant. We expect more companies to do so in 2016."
"singapore start-ups receiving government grants exiting via ipo, merger or acquisition","Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (a) in each year from 2010 to 2015, how many Singapore start-ups that have received Government grants have managed to successfully exit via IPO, merger or acquisition; (b) whether the exits, as a percentage of funded start-ups, on par with the ratios seen in other cities that are hotbeds of start-up activity.","Mr S Iswaran: From 2010 to 2015, SPRING and MDA supported a total of 562 start-ups through the Technology Enterprise Commercialisation Scheme (TECS), ACE Start-ups grant and the IDM Jumpstart and Mentor (iJAM) scheme. Over the same period, a total of nine start-ups that had previously received one of these grants successfully exited through an IPO, merger or acquisition.Agencies do not have equivalent data for comparison with other cities."
prosecutions for illegal use of electric bicycles,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Transport for each year from 2010 to 2015, what is the number of prosecutions for illegal use of electric bicycles.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The number of general cycling offences and the number of electric-bicycle specific offences from 2010 to 2015 are in Table 1 and Table 2 respectively. The offenders were issued warnings, offered composition fines or charged in court."
actions by case against errant vendors and retailers,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) how many legal actions have been brought by CASE against errant vendors and/or retailers in 2005 to 2015 and what proportion resulted in the courts taking action against these vendors/retailers.,"Mr S Iswaran: From 2005 to 2015, the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) filed six injunction applications in the courts against recalcitrant errant suppliers. All six applications resulted in the courts issuing injunction orders on the suppliers restraining them from carrying out the specified unfair practices such as making untrue statements to consumers about the availability or origin of the goods which the supplier was selling.Injunctions are the last resort in a spectrum of actions that can be taken against errant retailers under the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act. Before filing an injunction application in the courts, CASE may facilitate mediation between suppliers and consumers to reach mutually agreed outcomes. CASE may also propose that suppliers enter into voluntary compliance agreements (VCAs) to stop the specified unfair practices and compensate consumers. In most cases, errant retailers cease the unfair practices after mediation and/or entering into a VCA. In such instances, CASE does not need to file for injunctions against them. Over the same period, from 2005 to 2015, CASE facilitated about 1,700 mediation cases and entered into 17 VCAs."
experiment and sale of genetically-modified fish in singapore,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry will permit local fish farmers and scientists to experiment and sell genetically modified fish locally.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: Parties that wish to conduct research on genetically modified (GM) animals, including fish, must first obtain the approval of the Genetic Modification Advisory Committee (GMAC). The GMAC is a national committee, comprising representatives from government agencies, research bodies, and other supporting organisations overseeing the research and development, production, use, handling and release of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) in Singapore. In deciding whether to allow the proposal to proceed, GMAC will consider whether appropriate measures are in place for the safe containment, handling and transport of the GM animals, in accordance with the Singapore Biosafety Guidelines for Research on GMOs. This is to keep research safe and ensure public and environmental safety.Should any party wish to sell GM fish in Singapore for human consumption, they must first seek approval from the Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority (AVA). The AVA will assess the food safety of the fish in consultation with GMAC, and with reference to the food safety guidelines for GM foods, established by United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organisation and World Health Organisation."
update on electric vehicle (ev) phase 1 test-bed,Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the information gathered from the Electric Vehicle (EV) phase 1 test-bed has provided sufficient data to review our existing policies and infrastructure plans to support greater EV adoption in Singapore; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider rolling out a series of support measures for the adoption of EV.,Mr Khaw Boon Wan: The first phase of the electric vehicle test-bed was held from June 2011 to December 2013 to understand the technicalities of deploying electric vehicles in Singapore. The second phase will test fleet-based operations. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) and the Economic Development Board had issued a Request for Information (RFI) in December 2014 to invite proposals for a nationwide electric vehicle car-sharing programme. The proposals are in the final stages of evaluation. The LTA is also studying the feasibility of using electric vehicles for taxi services. These fleet-based trials will help Government agencies determine the optimal charging infrastructure required to support more widespread use of electric vehicles and the costs involved.
appeals for higher hdb loan quantum,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for National Development (a) how many appeals for a higher HDB loan quantum have been made from 2010 to 2015; (b) what is the median loan quantum that applicants appealed for; (c) what has been the success rate of such appeals; and (d) what is the breakdown of reasons for cases where the appeal has been rejected.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: HDB approved over 200,000 applications for an HDB Loan Eligibility letter between 2012 and 2015. Of these, about one in five (or 40,000) appealed for a larger housing loan. Generally, appellants asked for a larger loan to widen their flat choices, without specifying a loan quantum.Over one in three of such appeals were successful. HDB was unable to accede to the rest of the appeals as the applicants were unable to provide evidence of their ability to service the larger loan. As a flat purchase is a long-term financial commitment, it would not be prudent for potential home-buyers to take on additional financial burdens that they are unable to sustain."
number of persons' criminal records rendered spent,"Mr Ang Wei Neng asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) since the Registration of Criminals (Amendment) Act 2005 came into operation, how many persons have had their criminal records rendered spent as of 31 December 2015, with breakdowns by year; and (b) of these persons, how many are Singaporeans.","Mr K Shanmugam: The annual breakdown of persons who have had their criminal records rendered spent from 2005 to 2015 is provided in Table 1.Under the Registration of Criminals Act, sections 7B and 7C provide that a record in the Register of Criminals will automatically be marked as spent if the ex-offender satisfies certain criteria.To qualify for a record to be spent, the ex-offender must not have been sentenced to an imprisonment term exceeding three months or to a fine exceeding $2,000. The ex-offender must also satisfy a five-year crime-free period, among other criteria.Based on these criteria, those who have had their records spent since 2005 include ex-offenders who committed minor offences, such as shop theft. They also include foreign offenders, the majority of whom are immigration offenders.Of the 157,369 persons who have had their criminal records rendered spent as of 31 December 2015, 68,792 persons are Singaporeans and Permanent Residents (PRs). Of the 88,577 foreigners who have had their criminal records rendered spent as of 31 December 2015, more than half (47,836 persons) were convicted for entering or attempting to enter Singapore without a valid pass; or in other words, illegal immigrants.All of these illegal immigrants have been repatriated. Their convictions were recorded in the Register of Criminals and their criminal records would be automatically rendered spent after a five-year period. Notwithstanding the spent records, they are still required to seek prior written permission from the Controller of Immigration if they wish to enter Singapore."
statistics on foreigners given dependant passes and letter of consent to work in singapore,"Mr Chen Show Mao asked the Minister for Manpower (a) from 2011 to 2015, what is the number of foreigners given Dependant Passes; and (b) what is the number of Dependant Pass holders who are given the Letter of Consent granting them permission to work.",Mr Lim Swee Say: The increase in Dependant Passes (DP) and Letters of Consent issued to DPs from 2011 to 2015 are as follows:
update on dependants' protection scheme,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what has been the claims experience of the Dependants' Protection Scheme in the last five years; (b) how many CPF members have opted out of the scheme since its inception and what are their income profiles; (c) whether there are plans to review the scheme so that lower-income Singaporeans are protected in view of its opt-out nature; and (d) whether the scheme can be extended beyond the current age cap of 60 years to 67 years.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: The Dependants' Protection Scheme (DPS) is a term insurance scheme that mitigates the impact of a loss of future income, in the event of the member's untimely permanent incapacity or death. It provides his dependants with a sum of money to tide over the initial period.In the last five years from 2011-2015, the average number of claims approved under DPS was about 2,800 per year. The corresponding claim amount paid was about $141 million per year.On average, less than 1% of eligible CPF members opted out of DPS each year since its inception in 1989. About half of those who opted out were younger members aged 30 and below, and may have done so because they did not have dependants. Of the members who opted out, about 40% were not working, 40% with monthly income of more than $2,000 and remaining 20% with monthly income of less than $2,000.Today, DPS coverage stops at age 60. The need for DPS is expected to decline as the member approaches retirement. This is because the member’s children are more likely to have attained financial independence and the member would have accumulated more savings to support his dependants in the event of his untimely demise or incapacitation. Extending DPS coverage beyond age 60 will provide longer insurance protection but will also mean much higher premiums because of higher mortality. We will review the DPS age limit periodically, bearing in mind the need to strike a balance between providing insurance protection for the CPF members' dependants and preserving their CPF savings for their own retirement needs. CPF members who wish to have life insurance coverage beyond age 60 may consider obtaining it from private insurers."
additional assistance for retrenched pmets to retrain and upgrade for reemployment,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Manpower whether there will be any additional assistance, besides the $500 SkillsFuture grant, available for retrenched PMETs to re-train and upgrade themselves for re-employment.","Mr Lim Swee Say: The Ministry of Manpower is committed to actively support retrenched workers, including Professionals, Managers, Executives and Technicians (PMETs), to secure new employment. Besides helping them to improve skills through the SkillsFuture Credit, the Government also offers the SkillsFuture Mid-career Enhanced Subsidy for Singaporeans aged 40 and above to receive up to 90% subsidy of course fees for WDA-supported courses and at least 90% of programme cost for MOE-subsidised full-time and part-time courses.PMETs, including those retrenched, who wish to undergo skills conversion and change their professions, can tap on Professional Conversion Programmes (PCPs). Salary support of up to 70% of the monthly salary (subject to a cap of $2,000) is given to employers who hire them, with enhanced funding support for mature and long-term unemployed PMETs.To help match job-seeking PMETs with suitable positions in SMEs, the P-Max programme supports SMEs in the recruitment, training and management of PMETs with job-matching services, workshops, and an Assistance Grant of $5,000.In addition, the Career Support Programme (CSP) launched in October last year, helps Singaporean PMETs aged 40 and above to have better access to mid- and higher-level jobs while learning on-the-job. Under this programme, employers are given wage support for employing mature PMETs who have been actively searching for jobs for at least six months with a monthly gross salary of at least $4,000.Above all, WDA and e2i also help connect retrenched and at-risk PMETs to potential employers through platforms such as the Jobs Bank portal, job fairs, recruitment and networking events. The Ministry is also monitoring the current economic and labour market situation closely, and stands ready to strengthen employment support for all workers."
freelancers and self-employed workers in workforce,Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how many freelancers and self-employed workers are there currently in the workforce; (b) what is the number of freelancers and self-employed workers that make regular contributions to their Medisave accounts; and (c) whether the Work Injury Compensation Act can be extended to workers who are freelancers and self-employed.,"Mr Lim Swee Say: As of June 2015, 300,500 (or 14%) of employed residents (2,147,800) were self-employed persons (SEPs). Of these SEPs, 169,500 (or 8% of employed residents) were own account workers, who operate their own business or trade without employing any paid worker.Today, SEPs are required to contribute to their Medisave Accounts so as to save for their healthcare needs. As of December 2015, 82% of SEPs have made regular contributions to their Medisave accounts. To encourage more SEPs to make timely and regular Medisave contributions, the CPF Board reaches out to SEPs via annual mailers and road shows, and allows SEPs to make their Medisave contributions via instalments. The CPF Board also works with various Licensing Authorities to ensure that self-employed licensees make regular Medisave contributions.The Work Injury Compensation Act (WICA) requires employers to compensate their employees who have work-related injuries. As self-employed persons operate their own business or trade, there is no employer-employee relationship between them and their clients. As such, they are not covered under the WICA. Nonetheless, we encourage self-employed persons to purchase adequate insurance to protect themselves in the event of a work injury. I am heartened to note that NTUC's Freelancers and Self-Employed Unit (FSEU) has been engaging various freelancer groups, such as taxi drivers and sports coaches, on this matter."
traffic diversion plans to handle major traffic jams,Mr Ang Hin Kee asked the Minister for Transport (a) what are the traffic diversion plans to handle events of major traffic jams caused by road accidents or incidents; and (b) whether LTA will consider putting mobile columns as road dividers that are similar to the movable potted plants placed along ECP so that traffic diversions and U-turns can be made in such events.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Traffic diversions are managed by the Traffic Police, with support from the Land Transport Authority. Typically, the Traffic Police would deploy officers to divert traffic away from the accident site and ensure that motorists continue to drive safely. The Land Transport Authority would facilitate the traffic diversion by adjusting traffic light timings along diversion corridors, and disseminating incident information on the Expressway Monitoring and Advisory System (EMAS) and various online and radio channels.The Member suggested the use of mobile columns like those in ECP as road dividers so that in the event of an accident, they could be flexibly removed to allow for traffic diversion. However, these mobile columns cannot be easily reconfigured at short notice."
"mrt line to connect punggol, sengkang, fernvale, buangkok, yio chu kang, nee soon and sembawang","Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for Transport whether the Government will consider constructing a MRT line to connect the estates of Punggol, Sengkang, Fernvale, Buangkok, Yio Chu Kang, Nee Soon and Sembawang.","Mr Khaw Boon Wan: One of the MRT lines that the Government is currently studying is the Cross Island Line (CRL). If and when it is completed, the CRL will, among other benefits, connect the estates in Punggol, Sengkang, Fernvale and Buangkok. In the meantime, commuter travel between the north and north-east regions is being supported by public buses."
complaints of unauthorised salary deductions,Mr Chen Show Mao asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how many complaints of unauthorised salary deductions have been registered every year from 2010 to 2015; and (b) in how many of these cases are the complaints found to have been justified.,Mr Lim Swee Say: MOM received and investigated an average of 50 complaints per year from 2010 to 2015 involving allegations of unauthorised salary deductions under the Employment Act (EA). About a third of these cases were found to have contravened the EA following MOM's investigations.
update on preparations for national day parade's return to national stadium,Mr Vikram Nair asked the Minister for Defence if he will provide an update on the preparations for the National Day Parade's return to the National Stadium and the Government's estimated total expenditure on the National Day Parade 2016.,"Dr Ng Eng Hen: In response to separate but similar Parliamentary Questions on 29 February 2016, the Minister for Defence has provided an update on the preparations for the National Day Parade's return to the National Stadium and the Government's estimated total expenditure on the National Day Parade 2016. Please refer to that reply. [Please refer to Questions No *14 and No *15 in the Oral Answers to Questions section on 29 February 2016.]"
number of persons' criminal records rendered spent,"Mr Ang Wei Neng asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) since the Registration of Criminals (Amendment) Act 2005 came into operation, how many persons have had their criminal records rendered spent as of 31 December 2015, with breakdowns by year; and (b) of these persons, how many are Singaporeans.","Mr K Shanmugam: The annual breakdown of persons who have had their criminal records rendered spent from 2005 to 2015 is provided in Table 1.Under the Registration of Criminals Act, sections 7B and 7C provide that a record in the Register of Criminals will automatically be marked as spent if the ex-offender satisfies certain criteria.To qualify for a record to be spent, the ex-offender must not have been sentenced to an imprisonment term exceeding three months or to a fine exceeding $2,000.

applications for legal aid,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Law (a) what is the number of persons who applied to the Legal Aid Bureau for legal aid in each year from 2010 to 2015; and (b) what is the number of successful applicants in each of those years.,"Mr K Shanmugam: The Legal Aid Bureau monitors the number of applications it receives and the number of cases which qualify for legal aid on a Financial Year (FY) basis, that is, from April to March the following year. The data for FY 2010 to FY 2014 are set out in the following table:"
measures to retain nursing graduates in public sector,"Ms Cheng Li Hui asked the Minister for Health (a) for the last three years, what have been the percentages and numbers of nursing graduates who remain in the public sector after five years; and (b) what measures are there to retain them in the public sector in terms of their salaries, working hours, career opportunities and social recognition.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Among nursing graduates from the 2008, 2009 and 2010 cohorts who joined the public sector, 76% remained in the public sector after five years.Since 2014, we have been progressively implementing the ""Care"" package recommended by the National Nursing Taskforce (NNT) to strengthen the development of the nursing profession in the areas of Career, Autonomy, Recognition and Education.As part of the package, nurses in public healthcare institutions and MOH-subvented intermediate and long-term care sectors have received base salary increases of between 3% and 10% each year in 2014 and 2015, as well as a Nurse Special Payment of 0.5 month of their monthly base salary in December 2014 and 2015.To better enable nurses to balance their work with other family commitments, the public healthcare institutions are striving to make flexible and part-time work arrangements more accessible. After successful pilots of more flexible shift start times at Changi General Hospital, KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital, Singapore General Hospital and Tan Tock Seng Hospital, we are working to scale up the innovations across all public hospitals.To enhance the career progression of nurses in the public sector, the eligibility criteria for Enrolled Nurses (ENs) to undergo bridging studies has been revised. This has provided ENs with more opportunities to upgrade to become Registered Nurses, in line with the SkillsFuture initiative. In 2015, close to 180 ENs have enrolled in the bridging courses at NYP and NP as compared to 45 in 2014. In addition, we have introduced the Assistant Nurse Clinician role in 2015 to enable experienced Senior Staff Nurses to take on a clinical leadership role. We are nurturing more Advanced Practice Nurses through greater support for their training. We are also increasing funding support to the public healthcare sector to provide more opportunities for nurses to undergo skills upgrading for their professional development.Beyond salaries, working hours and career opportunities, another important area is for all of us, as a society, to continue to show appreciation, recognition and support for our nurses, not only on Nurses’ Day but every day."
efficacy of social service offices,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what has been the efficacy of the Social Service Offices since their inception; (b) what are the top five support schemes provided; and (c) whether there is a stable trend observed in the social assistance and services sought.,"Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: MSF established the Social Service Offices (SSOs) in 2013 to bring about more accessible and coordinated social help for Singaporeans. The SSOs provide financial assistance to low-income families who need help. They also work with Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs) and community partners to coordinate social services within each HDB town.With the full network of 24 centres up, some 95% of SSO beneficiaries living in HDB towns can access an SSO within 2 kilometres of where they live or work. Based on a 2015 MSF survey, nine in 10 SSO beneficiaries were satisfied with the SSOs’ location and service quality.The SSOs are also working with community partners such as the Family Service Centres to better coordinate help for families with more complex needs. This is a work in progress. Part of it includes piloting new service delivery models. For example, the SSOs at Taman Jurong and Kreta Ayer offer financial assistance, employment assistance and family services under one roof.When delivering financial assistance, the SSOs adopt a needs-based approach. The assistance can be classified into a few categories. In order of decreasing number of beneficiaries, these would be (i) short-to-medium-term assistance for those looking for work or temporarily unable to work; (ii) long-term assistance for those permanently unable to work; and (iii) interim assistance for those who require immediate or one-off assistance.With better accessibility and greater awareness, the SSOs have helped more Singaporeans. For example, the number of households that received ComCare short-to-medium term and long-term financial assistance has increased from 23,992 in FY2012 to 31,307 in FY2014."
plans for paediatric and neonatology services for residents in northern sector,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for Health (a) whether there are plans to offer paediatric and neonatology services for residents living in the northern sector; and (b) if so, whether there is a timeframe as to when residents can expect these services to be ready.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: Paediatric services are provided at various levels ranging from primary to tertiary care. At the primary healthcare level, general practitioners (GPs) and polyclinics manage common paediatric and neonatal conditions as well as provide well child services such as developmental assessment and childhood vaccinations. There are already existing healthcare facilities in the north providing care for women and children at the primary care level, including the two polyclinics at Yishun and Woodlands and some General Practitioner (GP) clinics, out of around 130 GP clinics in the north. In addition, there are nine specialised clinics that provide Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Paediatric services in the community in the north.Over the next few years, residents in the north can look forward to new service developments and healthcare facilities. We will be opening Woodlands Integrated Healthcare Campus (WIHC), which includes a new acute hospital, in phases from 2022 to complement the existing Khoo Teck Puat Hospital in Yishun. MOH is currently in the process of planning the clinical services for WIHC.Services planning for this new campus will be based on both regional healthcare needs and the optimisation of clinical expertise and manpower resources across the national healthcare system. We will ensure that good quality healthcare services are accessible to patients."
"payments made to sports hub partner per year for building, maintaining and operating facility","Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) to date, how much payments has the Government made to the Sports Hub partner per year for building, maintaining, and operating the facility; and (b) what is the estimated total amount that will be paid at the end of the 25 years.","Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: Sports Hub Pte Ltd (SHPL) was contracted to design, build, finance and operate the Sports Hub for 25 years under the public-private partnership (PPP) arrangement.Under the PPP arrangement, Sport Singapore is contracted to pay SHPL an annual availability payment of $193.7 million (subject to inflation) from the commencement of operations.The Government began making the full annual availability payments to SHPL in July 2014. At the end of the concession period, SHPL is required to hand back the facilities to the Government.The availability payments under the PPP arrangement help to spread the total project cost evenly over the duration of the contract. It also requires the private partner to bear the construction and operational risks of the project. For instance, SHPL had to manage at its own cost, the challenges of poor soil conditions during the construction phase, as well as rectify early issues with the National Stadium pitch and roof.Sport Singapore closely monitors the performance of SHPL to ensure that they remain accountable for the goals of the project and seek to maximise the value of the Sports Hub for Singaporeans."
teenager holding dual citizenship seeking exemption from national service,"Mr David Ong asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether the Ministry has entered into discussions with New Zealand on the issue of the teenager holding dual citizenships of Singapore and New Zealand who is seeking exemption from National Service and, if so, what is the progress of these discussions.","Dr Vivian Balakrishnan: The New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (NZ MFAT) made a request for Singapore to provide a point of contact on the case of a teenager who holds dual citizenship. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) has informed NZ MFAT of the point of contact from the Ministry of Defence.MFA has conveyed our citizenship laws and the principles underlying our National Service (NS), to MFAT. Pursuant to the Enlistment Act, all Singapore Citizens and PRs above the age of 18 years are required to serve NS. As the teenager in question is a Singapore Citizen, he has to fulfil his NS obligations. Even if he were to subsequently apply for renunciation of his citizenship after he attains the age of majority, he would still remain liable for any breaches of the Enlistment Act. He is advised to return to Singapore as soon as possible to resolve the matter.Singapore adheres to the fundamental principles of universality and equity for NS. All Singaporeans are expected to fulfil our NS obligations as citizens. It would not be fair to allow citizens to avoid NS just because they reside overseas."
number and profile of stateless persons living in singapore,"Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) as of January 2016, what is the number of stateless residents living in Singapore; (b) what is the gender profile of these residents; and (c) what is the number of such residents who are aged 50 and above.","Mr K Shanmugam: As at 31 January 2016, there were 1, 411 stateless persons living in Singapore.Of these, 59% are male and 41% female.One thousand and forty-eight or 74% of them are aged 50 and up.The majority came from other countries to live and work in Singapore. Others were born in Singapore but were not eligible for Singapore Citizenship (SC) at birth as their parents were not Singapore Citizens at the time of their birth and did not obtain foreign citizenship for them from their home countries.Many of the stateless persons have since become Permanent Residents (PRs). As PRs, they can enjoy the various benefits such as healthcare, housing and education, that are accorded to PRs. Stateless PRs can also acquire SC if they meet the requirements for the grant of SC."
permanent residents renouncing pr status before age 21,Mr David Ong asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether the Ministry will consider allowing permanent residents to renounce their PR status before the age of 21 years especially if they are not residing in Singapore.,"Mr K Shanmugam: There are currently no age restrictions imposed on Permanent Residents (PRs) who intend to renounce their PR status.Being a PR is a step towards citizenship and only those who intend to take up Singapore Citizenship should apply for PR.Male PRs who renounce their PR status before fulfilling their National Service obligations will face serious adverse consequences when they subsequently apply to study, work, or live in Singapore. Any subsequent PR or citizenship applications will be affected. In addition, any renewal of Re-Entry Permits (REPs) by PR's parents and immediate family members may be affected."
change in income profile and consumption of public utilities by housing type,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked the Minister for National Development for the past 10 years (a) what has been the change in (i) average income per household and (ii) per capita income for each housing type of 2-room, 3-room, 4-room, and 5-room or more in public, private and landed properties; and (b) what has been the average consumption of public utilities (water and electricity) for each housing type.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Based on data published by the Department of Statistics, the change in average monthly household income for each housing type over the past 10 years is shown in Table 1.The change in average monthly per capita household income over the same period for each housing type is shown in Table 2.The Household Expenditure Survey provides data on the average consumption of water and electricity for each housing type. This does not account for Government rebates on utilities, which would have helped to reduce household expenditures. The consumption data is shown in Table 3."
implementation of reverse mortgages for hdb flats,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the progress of HDB's study on implementing reverse mortgages for HDB flats; (b) what are the benefits of this mortgage scheme over the current HDB Lease Buyback Scheme; and (c) whether HDB will consider allowing owners to make use of reverse mortgages on a case-by-case basis especially for those who find this more suited for their needs.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: MND has completed its study on reverse mortgages for HDB flats. A reverse mortgage is a loan taken up by a property owner using his property as collateral. However, unlike a conventional mortgage, the borrower does not need to make cash repayment during the loan tenure. He only needs to repay the loan with accumulated interest upon loan termination or death, typically from the sales proceeds of his property. A reverse mortgage thus allows the property owner to unlock some equity while retaining the financial upside from any appreciation in property value.A reverse mortgage is a complex financial product with inherent risks. First, as it does not require periodic cash repayments, the loan balance grows with interest. Second, the flat owner has to bear property risks. If the market value of the property becomes less than the outstanding loan, the owners may have to sell the property prematurely to repay the loan, resulting in them having to look for alternative accommodation at an old age.We note that NTUC Income offered reverse mortgage for HDB flats in 2006. As only 24 households signed up, NTUC Income has since stopped offering the product. The take-up overseas is also not high.There are various other monetisation options for HDB flat owners today, such as the Lease Buyback Scheme (LBS). The LBS is an equity sale scheme where flat owners sell the tail-end lease of their flat to HDB and retain a shorter lease. This enables elderly households to receive a lifelong stream of income to supplement their retirement income. As compared to reverse mortgage, while LBS owners cannot sell their flat in the open market, they do not face any property equity risks. We recently enhanced the LBS in April 2015, and this was well received.Besides LBS, elderly flat owners may take up the Silver Housing Bonus if they right-size to a 3-room or smaller flat. They also have other options of subletting either a bedroom or the entire flat, and staying with their family members.Thus, MND has no plans to introduce reverse mortgage for HDB flats for now. MND will continue to regularly review and adjust our various schemes to meet the needs of our elderly."
applications by homeless singaporeans for hdb rental flats,"Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for National Development (a) from 2013 to 2015, how many applications have been made by homeless Singaporeans for a flat under (i) HDB's public rental scheme and (ii) HDB's interim rental housing scheme; (b) how many of such applications are successful; and (c) what follow-up measures are being put in place to ensure that unsuccessful applicants have a roof over their heads.","Mr Lawrence Wong: From 2013 to 2015, the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) provided shelter to about 900 individuals and families. Among them, 400 applied for a public rental flat. Around half of these applications were successful. This includes several who were provided with Interim Rental Housing (IRH), which is offered on a case-by-case basis and is not open for public application.Those who were unsuccessful in their rental flat applications mostly had other housing options when they applied, such as being able to afford a flat or having family support. Some were existing owners, tenants or authorised occupiers of HDB flats, but who were no longer living in their current homes for a variety of reasons, for example, due to family disputes. For those who have no place to stay, MSF will work with the social service agencies to provide temporary shelter while they find alternative accommodation.HDB, MSF and the social service agencies also work together to help individuals and families address the underlying causes of their housing instability. This may include counselling, financial assistance, employment support, and advice on their housing options. HDB will continue to exercise flexibility to provide rental flats for deserving cases."
"early intervention services for children with speech delay, autism and at risk of moderate to severe disabilities","Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) how many children below the age of 7 years with speech delay, autism and at risk of moderate to severe disabilities are currently receiving and awaiting early intervention services at Government-funded voluntary welfare organisations; and (b) what is the current waiting time for these early intervention programmes.","Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: The Early Intervention Programme for Infants and Children (EIPIC) serves children with moderate to severe disabilities with speech delay, Autism and other developmental needs. Subsidised by the Government, EIPIC services are available at 17 Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWO) located across Singapore. About 2,600 children benefited from EIPIC in 2015. Of these, 6% were diagnosed with speech and language delays, and 47% were diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD).Children currently have to wait an average of five to six months to enrol in an EIPIC centre. Some centres have a longer wait time due to parents' preferences. MSF will continue to work with VWOs expand capacity to meet the demand. There will be 28% more EIPIC places, or a total of 3,200 places, by 2018.As children are best served in their natural settings, children with milder needs are served in mainstream preschools that offer the Development Support Programme (DSP). In 2015, about 1,200 children benefited from the DSP. The capacity and capability of these preschools will be further developed to meet demand."
disbursements from open door fund,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) how many awards under the Open Door Fund have been disbursed each year since the fund was launched; (b) what is the average quantum of the disbursal; and (c) what results have been reported in terms of the number of persons with disabilities hired in cases where the funds have been applied.,"Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: In 2014, the Open Door Fund (ODF) was enhanced, and renamed the Open Door Programme (ODP). The ODP is supported by the Singapore Workforce Development Agency and Ministry of Social and Family Development, and administered by SG Enable. It encourages the employment of persons with disabilities, through a range of initiatives, including apprenticeships, training, job and workplace re-design. Since 2014, 140 companies have applied for ODP support for the employment of persons with disabilities. The average claim per company is $3,000.Besides the ODP, there are other initiatives to promote the employment of persons with disabilities. For example, SG Enable works with Voluntary Welfare Organisation partners to provide job placement and support services for persons with disabilities. Collectively, they have placed about 650 persons with disabilities in employment over the past two years, some with the support of the ODP."
flats available under hdb's interim rental housing scheme,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the number of rental flats that are presently made available under HDB's Interim Rental Housing Scheme (IRH); (b) how many families can the existing IRH scheme accommodate; and (c) whether the present number of rental flats is adequate to ensure that the most vulnerable in our society has a roof over their heads.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: There are currently about 500 IRH flats which provide housing for 1,000 families on a flat-sharing basis.HDB reviews its rental flat supply regularly to ensure that there are sufficient flats. This is why HDB has progressively increased the public rental flat supply from 42,000 in 2007 to the present 53,000 units, with the aim of reaching 60,000 by 2017. In addition, HDB evaluates applications carefully to ensure that rental flats are safeguarded for the lower income and vulnerable households."
upgrading under home improvement programme,Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for National Development (a) how many flats have yet to be announced for upgrading under the Home Improvement Programme (HIP) for each Town Council; and (b) whether HDB is on track to complete the announcement of all eligible flats for HIP by 2018.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The Home Improvement Programme (HIP) was introduced in 2007 with about 300,000 eligible flats.To date, HIP has been announced for slightly over 200,000 flats. The remaining 100,000 or so flats have not been selected or announced. All Town Councils would be aware of the blocks in their constituencies which would meet the HIP nomination and selection criteria.HDB is still working to complete the selection of the remaining HIP-eligible flats by FY2018. But as with all publicly-funded programmes, this will be contingent on the Government's fiscal position and budget availability."
hdb flats eligible for neighbourhood renewal programme,Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for National Development how many flats are eligible for the Neighbourhood Renewal Programme (NRP) for each Town Council and whether HDB plans to increase the tempo of this programme.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The Neighbourhood Renewal Programme (NRP) was launched in 2007 and will benefit about 200,000 eligible flats. In September 2014, the age criteria for the NRP was extended to include blocks built up to 1995, increasing the number of eligible flats by another 100,000. Thereafter, HDB had informed all Town Councils of the blocks that are eligible for the NRP. The pace of the NRP is dependent on the availability of resources to fund these programmes, and also the ability of the Town Councils to effectively implement and manage these projects on the ground."
review of property cooling measures,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for National Development whether he will consider reviewing the property cooling measures by removing the Additional Buyers Stamp Duty (ABSD) for Singaporeans but retaining the ABSD for foreigners.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The property market cooling measures are intended to keep the market stable and sustainable. It is too early to relax the measures now. Doing so could result in a market rebound.The Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty (ABSD) was introduced to moderate the demand for residential property from investors, non-citizens and corporate entities. Singapore citizens who do not own any residential property do not need to pay ABSD."
update on pilot moe kindergarten project,Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Acting Minister for Education (Schools) if he will provide an update on the Ministry's pilot MOE Kindergarten project and the response to the Ministry's recruitment of pre-school educators.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: The MOE Kindergartens (MKs) were first set up in 2014 with the intent to provide quality and affordable pre-school education (PSE) to Singaporeans and catalyse quality improvements in kindergarten education. To date, there are 15 MKs of which 12 are located within our primary schools and the remaining three in community sites. All are situated in HDB heartlands for accessibility to children from a variety of backgrounds. The MKs currently serve a total of almost 1,700 children.The MK positions, comprising Centre Heads, Deputy Centre Heads and teachers, have attracted the interest of both trained teachers from the sector, as well as fresh graduands from early childhood and care education courses. To better meet the manpower needs of the MKs and other providers in the pre-school sector, MOE has also partnered Singapore Polytechnic to pilot a full-time place and train programme to select suitable candidates and put them through the Diploma in Kindergarten Education. MOE will continue its efforts to attract and retain good MK educators.Over the past two years, we have received consistent favourable feedback from parents that their children enjoy the learning activities and are eager to attend the MK. They shared that their children are better able to express themselves and are more independent, and conveyed their appreciation for the dedication of the teachers in providing a fun and engaging learning environment for their children.MOE will continue to monitor the progress of the MKs in delivering a quality curriculum that is relevant to the Singaporean child and work towards sharing good practices with the pre-school sector."
availability of student care places,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Acting Minister for Education (Schools) (a) how many student care places are currently available at schools; (b) how many places are available at places outside of schools; (c) what is the mean and median waiting list for student care places; and (d) what are the Ministry's plans to gauge demand and adapt supply to fit demand in future.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: The Ministry of Education (MOE) recognises that Student Care Centres (SCCs) provide important after-school support for students. Over the last four years, we have steadily increased the number of school-based SCCs from fewer than 50 to 127, and the overall student enrolment from around 3,000 to more than 15,000.Amongst SCCs registered with the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), around 300 are in community spaces, with a combined enrolment of over 12,000 students. These centres complement school-based SCCs in the provision of after-school care.The average and median number of waitlisted students in school-based SCCs is smaller than 10. However, the waitlist situation varies from school to school. MOE will continue to work with MSF to monitor the demand for SCC places both in our schools and in the community. We will also work with our schools to facilitate the setting up of new SCCs as well as expanding enrolment for existing ones, at a pace that does not cause quality to be compromised."
criteria for edusave merit award,Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Acting Minister for Education (Schools) (a) what is the number of students in 2015 who are eligible for the Edusave Merit Award but who did not qualify because they exceeded the income eligibility criteria; and (b) whether the Ministry can consider giving these certificates to the students to affirm their achievements for being in the top 25% of the cohort stream.,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: In 2015, about 47,000 students who met the Edusave Merit Bursary (EMB)’s academic criterion, i.e., they were in the top 25% of their level and course in school, did not apply for the EMB, likely because their families exceeded its income criterion.All students who are eligible to apply for the EMB based on its academic criterion are currently issued a Certificate of Academic Achievement to recognise them for their good performance, regardless of whether they meet the income criterion. They receive this certificate when they are informed of their eligibility to apply for the EMB. Furthermore, students who perform well in various academic and non-academic domains can also strive for other Edusave Awards, which have no income criterion, such as the Edusave Scholarship, Edusave Good Progress Award, Edusave Character Award, and Edusave Award for Achievement, Good Leadership and Service (EAGLES)."
number of junior college students not proceeding to universities after graduation,"Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked the Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) for the past five years (a) how many junior college students do not go on to universities after their graduation; and (b) of these students, how many are male students who do not go on to universities after completing their national service.","Mr Ong Ye Kung: About three in 10 A-Level students who graduated from junior colleges from 2007 to 2011 chose not to or were unable to progress to a full-time programme in a local autonomous university (AU). This is about 4,400 students per year. Of which, about 1,600 per year, or two in five, were male students who have served their National Service. Most of the students who do not progress to the AUs have been pursuing other upgrading options based on their interest and strengths, such as polytechnics, arts institutions, overseas universities and private education institutions, or proceed to work."
stateless people living in public rental flats,"Mr Png Eng Huat asked the Minister for National Development as of January 2016, what is the number of stateless people who are living in public rental flats.","Mr Lawrence Wong: As of January 2016, there are 613 stateless persons living in HDB public rental flats. Most live with their Singapore Citizen (SC) family members or another SC single."
breakdown of local and foreign pmes in singapore by industry and sector,"Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Minister for Manpower what is the breakdown of Singaporean, permanent resident and foreign professionals, managers and executives in Singapore annually from 2013 to 2015 according to the various industries/sectors which include manufacturing, construction, services, banking and finance, IT and communications.","Mr Lim Swee Say: A breakdown of Professionals, Managers, Executives & Technicians (PMETs) from 2013 to 2015 by residential status and sectors is provided in Table 1."
unemployment rate of singaporean and singaporean pr pmes,"Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Minister for Manpower what is the unemployment rate of Singaporeans and Singaporean permanent residents who are professionals, managers and executives from 2011 to 2015 broken down by age and gender.","Mr Lim Swee Say: The unemployment rates of residents in Professional, Managerial, Executive & Technical (PMET) occupations by age and gender, from 2011 – 2015, are provided in Table 1."
nwc dollar quantum payouts for low-wage workers,"Mr Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how many low-wage workers, and what percentage of them, have received the dollar quantum payouts of $60, recommended by the National Wages Council (NWC) in 2015; and (b) whether these payouts can be made compulsory for workers from the bottom 10th percentile of the workforce.","Mr Lim Swee Say: Since the NWC quantitative guidelines were introduced in 2012, the proportion of full-time employed resident employees earning basic monthly salary of up to $1,000 is estimated to have decreased from 9.8% in 2012 to 6.8% in 2014.The Ministry's Survey on Annual Wage Changes showed that, nearly 6 in 10 (59%) private establishments with employees earning a basic monthly salary of up to $1,000, had given or decided to give wage increases to these employees in 2014. This included 3 in 10 (31%) which gave the NWC's recommended built-in wage increase of at least a $60 to this group of workers. Data for 2015 is not yet available.The NWC Guidelines are arrived at through tripartite consultation and consensus, which recommend that businesses take into account economic conditions, business performance and employees’ contribution in determining wage increases. Such consensus-building helps facilitate the acceptance and implementation of guidelines. While NWC Guidelines are not mandatory, they are widely referred to by companies in both the unionised and non-unionised sectors. They are also gazetted under the Employment Act and form the basis for wage negotiations between unions and management."
early voting by postal ballot in general elections,"Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Prime Minister whether the Government will consider allowing early voting by postal ballot at the general elections, given that there are more than 200,000 Singapore citizens living abroad and most do not vote using the current overseas voting facilities.","Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): In postal voting, there are risks with security and secrecy of the ballot as it may be lost or tampered with during postal delivery. In addition, ballot papers have to be sent to the voter at their registered overseas addresses and they have to mail back the marked ballot papers to the Returning Officer by a certain date. It is difficult to ensure that the ballots will get back on time to be counted. Late votes and missing votes will result in controversies. For now, voting by paper ballot at polling stations is still the simplest and most transparent method of voting that can ensure the integrity and secrecy of the voting process."
career support progrmme,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what are the types of jobs thus far identified in the Career Support Programme (CSP) that pay at least $4,000 a month; (b) whether the Ministry will be monitoring the employment status of those on the programme after the period of wage support ends so as to assess the value and sustainability of the CSP.","Mr Lim Swee Say: The Career Support Programme (CSP) was launched as a pilot programme on 1 October 2015 to provide Singaporeans aged 40 and over, who have been looking for jobs for at least six months, greater opportunities to access mid-level and above jobs. Under the CSP, wage support is provided to support employers who hire such individuals in any job that pays a gross salary of at least $4,000 a month. Jobs that have been supported by the CSP so far include jobs in functions such as Business Development, Project Management, Sales & Marketing, Finance, Operations, and Information Technology. WDA will be monitoring the employment status of the individuals who have been placed through CSP."
mid-career pmes hired by ministries and statutory boards,"Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan asked the Prime Minister how many mid-career professionals, managers and executives aged 40 years and above have Ministries and statutory boards hired as (i) permanent and (ii) contract staff each year from 2011-2015.","Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister): Between 2011 and 2015, about 7,100 mid-career Professionals, Managers and Executives (PMEs) aged 40 years and above were recruited by the ministries and statutory boards, or an average of about 1,400 of such officers recruited each year. This is about 11% of all new hires during this period.Most new hires in the Public Service are placed on contracts to assess their suitability for the job. If they have performed well in the job and are assessed to be suitable for a long-term career with the Service, they will be placed on permanent positions after one or two years."
applications for off-peak bus/mrt travel pass,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Transport what has been the total cumulative number of applicants for the off-peak bus/MRT travel pass thus far.,"Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Since the launch of the off-peak pass in July 2015, about 21,000 commuters have purchased the off-peak passes."
resale levy on new hdb flat buyers,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for National Development (a) how many new HDB flat buyers were made to pay the resale levy in 2010-2015; (b) of these buyers, how many paid up in full; (c) how many buyers requested to have the levy wholly or partially waived; (d) what were the main reasons given for requesting these waivers; and (e) what proportion of these requests was successful.","Mr Lawrence Wong: Singaporeans enjoy a housing subsidy when they buy a new flat from HDB or a resale flat in the open market with a Central Provident Fund (CPF) housing grant. Flat owners who have sold their first subsidised flat have to pay a resale levy when they buy another subsidised flat from HDB.The resale levy policy aims to ensure a fair distribution of subsidies between first- and second-timers, and prioritise the allocation of subsidies to groups that need them most, such as first-timer citizen families seeking to buy a subsidised new flat to start their families.From 2010 to 2015, about 7,900 second-timer households had paid the required resale levy amount. Over the same period, HDB received about 3,500 requests to waive the resale levy totally and about 4,100 requests to waive the resale levy partially.HDB assesses the appeals based on the merits of each case and advises the buyers accordingly. HDB does not allow for full waiver of the levy. For those applying for partial waiver, HDB has acceded to about one-third of the appeals. These are usually second-timer households who sold their flats some time ago, and have accrued high interest amounts and face significant financial hardship. So HDB will take into account their family situations and circumstances, and see how best to help them. In some cases where buyers lack the cash to pay the resale levy, HDB would help by incorporating the resale levy into the purchase price of the second subsidised flat the appellant is buying so that the appellant can subsequently pay the levy by instalments."
water supply disruption in clementi town,Dr Tan Wu Meng asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what are the causes leading to the water supply disruption in Clementi Town on 28 October 2015; and (b) what are the actions taken by PUB to prevent a similar occurrence from recurring.,"11 Dr Tan Wu Meng asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources how does PUB determine the deployment of water wagons and an onsite technical team during a water supply outage.Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The water supply disruption in Clementi Town on 28 October 2015 was caused by an unexpected closure of a valve on a key pipeline supplying water to the Clementi Town. PUB was carrying out upgrading works of the control system to the valve when a software glitch occurred. This resulted in the unexpected closure of the valve and interrupted water flow into the distribution network.For such upgrading works, PUB follows the industry practice of factory testing, followed by site-testing prior to the commissioning of the works. Following this incident, PUB has tightened its testing and commissioning processes to prevent the recurrence of a similar incident. The upgraded control system has since been commissioned.On the deployment of water wagons, PUB operates a 24-hour centre to receive, respond and monitor customers' feedback. Water wagons are deployed by the centre when there is a water supply disruption affecting a large number of customers. PUB's technical crew is deployed for all water supply-related feedback which requires on-site attention, for example, to check water pressure and quality.In the incident on 28 October 2015, the customers affected were located at the lower floors, which receive water directly from the PUB mains. Upon receiving feedback at 5.40 pm, PUB had immediately deployed service vans and water wagons to the premises. The water supply was progressively restored from 6.40 pm, after PUB officers re-opened the affected valve. Customers on higher floors were not affected as they get their supply from the rooftop water tanks."
difference in cost of medication in local and overseas hospitals and pharmacies,"Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the rationale for the difference in the cost of medication in local hospitals and pharmacies as compared with those in neighbouring countries; and (b) whether there will be a review of pricing policy in order to balance out the cost between the two, if possible, so as to make medication more affordable for Singaporeans.","Mr Gan Kim Yong: The cost of medicines differs across countries due to factors such as operating costs as well as pharmaceutical firms’ pricing strategy for the various markets, which takes into account the size and purchasing power of the respective markets.To reduce the cost of medicines, our public healthcare institutions undertake joint group procurement for about 90% of our drugs to enjoy economies of scale. The savings are reflected in the prices of medicines sold to patients.To keep drugs affordable for subsidised patients, the Ministry of Health regularly reviews the subsidies of medications which were recently enhanced to improve their affordability. Since 1 January 2015, lower- to middle-income patients at the Specialist Outpatient Clinics (SOCs) and polyclinics can receive 75% subsidy for drugs listed on the Standard Drug List (SDL), up from 50% previously. This effectively halves the patients’ share of the cost of their medications. Pioneers enjoy a further 50%-off their subsidised outpatient drugs.Besides helping patients pay for their drugs, the Ministry also regularly reviews the coverage of subsidised drugs. In 2015, 12 new drugs were added into the SDL and Medication Assistance Fund, including drugs used to treat colorectal cancer and Alzheimer’s disease. We will continue to review our policies to keep healthcare affordable."
harassment and intimidation by licensed moneylenders,"Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Law given the increasing number of cases of harassment and intimidation by licensed moneylenders (a) whether stronger measures can be introduced to protect borrowers; and (b) whether the time has come to introduce clear guidelines or regulations on acceptable debt collection practices and behaviour, as was recommended by the Advisory Committee on Moneylending in its Final Report.","Mr K Shanmugam: The number of reports filed at the Registry of Moneylenders against licensed moneylenders for debt collection-related activities has fallen significantly from 124 in 2013 to 45 in 2015. Borrowers who encounter criminal behaviour from licensed moneylenders or their debt collectors should report the matter to the police or the Registry of Moneylenders. Moneylenders found to have committed offences may have their licences suspended, not renewed, or revoked by the Registry.There are sufficient safeguards currently to protect debtors from unreasonable or illegal conduct by creditors, including licensed moneylenders or their debt collectors. For example, the Protection from Harassment Act 2014 provides for criminal sanctions and civil remedies against unreasonable harassing behaviour.The Ministry of Law has implemented some of the recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Moneylending and will be implementing other recommendations in the coming months. The recommendation to introduce a set of guidelines for licensed moneylenders on acceptable debt collection practices will be reviewed at a later date, to give the moneylending industry some time to adjust to other regulatory changes."
medical bills of foreign workers,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked the Minister for Health (a) what has been the trend of medical bills for foreign workers in the last five years; and (b) what has been the average size of these bills and the arrears incurred in our restructured hospitals especially for those with more serious diagnoses.,"Mr Gan Kim Yong: Hospital bills of foreigners are not subsidised. The median bill size for foreign workers increased by about 7% a year from 2011 to 2014, and was about $2,000 in 2014. Employers are required to purchase healthcare insurance coverage of at least $15,000 for their employees on Work Permits and S passes. This is sufficient to fully pay for 96% of day surgery and inpatient bills incurred by foreign workers at the public hospitals in 2014.All foreigners, including foreign workers, account for about 14% of the arrears cases that are outstanding for more than two months at the public hospitals, in all settings."
disbursements of comcare interim assistance and short-to-medium term assistance,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Social and Family Development what is the percentage, by number and dollar value of disbursements, of ComCare interim assistance and Short-to-Medium Term Assistance disbursals in 2010-2015 to recipients who have sought financial assistance due to retrenchment or early termination of contract employment.","Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: Some ComCare applicants are unemployed and seeking employment. The percentage of households receiving ComCare Short-to-Medium Term Assistance (SMTA) and the proportion of assistance disbursed where the main applicant is unemployed and seeking employment are shown in Table 1. These individuals could be unemployed due to a variety or combination of reasons. MSF does not currently have a breakdown on who amongst them are unemployed due to retrenchment or early termination of contract employment.ComCare Interim Assistance schemes provide small amounts of urgent and temporary assistance to families with immediate needs. These could be provided through a number of agencies, including the Social Service Offices and Family Service Centres. Given the nature of the scheme, MSF does not have the breakdown of the detailed reasons for seeking assistance."
gic and temasek holdings' investments in haze-linked companies,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Finance (a) whether the Government monitors if GIC and Temasek Holdings (TH) have investments in haze-linked companies; (b) if so, how much are the total investments of GIC and TH in these companies; and (c) how will GIC and TH ensure that their investment monies do not support haze activities.","Mr Heng Swee Keat: The individual investments of GIC and Temasek are the responsibility of their respective management teams, while the Government monitors the performance of their overall portfolio. GIC and Temasek operate on a purely commercial basis in order to maximise long-term risk-adjusted returns, and the individual investment decisions are fully independent of any Government interference or influence. This is an important governance principle that we seek to maintain.The investment activities of GIC and Temasek are oriented towards generating long-term returns on a sustainable basis. Investing in companies with environmentally unsustainable practices could negatively impact the commercial value of the investments over the long term.Temasek has stated3 that it fully supports zero-burning policies for land clearance, and would urge palm oil companies and plantation owners to do the same. GIC has also informed the Government that the palm oil companies in Indonesia that GIC invests in have confirmed that they observe zero-burning policies for their plantations. GIC’s investment teams engage actively with the companies’ management and highlight that such responsible actions are important for maintaining the long-term value of the companies."
agriculture productivity fund disbursements,Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for National Development (a) how much of the Agriculture Productivity Fund has been disbursed in each year since 2009; (b) what categories of projects have attracted the largest funding amounts; (c) what are the criteria for determining the size of the grants received; and (d) how does the Ministry ensure that these recipients perform as expected.,"Mr Lawrence Wong: The Agriculture Productivity Fund (APF) was launched in end-2014 to help our farmers boost their yields and raise productivity. The APF co-funds initiatives such as farm capability development to support productivity improvements, and research and development (R&D) in innovative production technologies.About $0.69 million was disbursed from APF in 2015. As the scheme is still new, we can expect higher take-up and greater disbursement of funds over the coming years. Before the introduction of the APF, there was a Food Fund scheme, which served a similar purpose, and which had disbursed about $18 million from 2009 to 2014.Thus far, the projects receiving the highest APF funding have been those that involve the purchase of advanced, high-technology production systems. The size of grants depends on the nature and scale of the project. Generally, farms can receive up to 50% co-funding for basic capability upgrading, up to 70% co-funding for productivity enhancements, and up to 90% co-funding for R&D projects, with varying quantums for the different farm types.AVA works closely with recipients to ensure successful project outcomes at key milestones during the project timeline. AVA also conducts Post-Implementation Reviews together with APF recipients upon project completion to ensure that productivity deliverables are met before final funding amounts are disbursed."
display of trailers for horror or violent movies in public places,"Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Communications and Information whether measures can be taken to prohibit trailers for horror or violent movies with ratings of PG13 and above, like ""Pay the Ghost"", ""The Activity"" and ""Crimson Peak"", from being displayed in public places which are frequented by young children such as MRT stations.","Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim: Similar to films, trailers of films meant for exhibition must be submitted to the Media Development Authority (MDA) for classification. The trailers will be classified under one of the film classification ratings, i.e. General (G), Parental Guidance (PG), Parental Guidance 13 (PG13), No Children Under 16 (NC16), Mature 18 (M18) or Restricted 21 (R21). The rating for a trailer may differ from rating for the film itself because a trailer comprises snippets of the film, which collectively may have a different overall impact on viewers. Where a trailer may not be suitable for children, a higher rating is imposed so that children are not exposed to them. MDA disallows trailers classified PG13 or higher, such as the trailer for ""Pay the Ghost"", to be shown prior to the screening of films rated G or PG, or in public places such as video walls. MDA is investigating the matter and will take action if there has been a violation."
use of portable airconditioners and air purifiers in school classrooms when psi > 100,Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Acting Minister for Education (Schools) whether the Ministry will consider utilising portable airconditioners and air purifiers in school classrooms whenever the Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) reading reaches the Unhealthy range and beyond (PSI readings of > 100).,"Mr Ng Chee Meng: Following the completion of our haze management review, the Ministry of Education (MOE) will be deploying air purifiers to all school classrooms to further enhance the well-being of our students and staff during a haze situation.MOE will deploy about 25,000 air purifiers to all primary and secondary schools in Singapore by July 2016. Similarly, VWO-run special education schools and MOE Kindergartens – which take reference from and are guided by haze management measures taken by our schools – will also be equipped with air purifiers. Schools will be provided guidelines on the use of the air purifiers.This enhancement to our haze management measures takes into account the unusually prolonged haze season of 2015 as a possible forerunner of future haze seasons, and is introduced in consultation with the National Environment Agency (NEA) and Ministry of Health (MOH)."
retrenchments caused by redundancies,"Mr Leon Perera asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether cases of employees being terminated with notice are included in the definition of redundancies in the redundancy data published in the Ministry's Labour Market Survey; (b) if not, what is the Ministry's estimate of the number of employees who have been made redundant by way of termination with notice in 2013-2015; and (c) what percentage of employees made redundant in 2013-2015 in the Ministry's published data have been made so as a result of publicly announced retrenchment exercises by employers.",Mr Lim Swee Say: Redundancy data collected from MOM’s Labour Market Survey include employees terminated with notice. The data includes all retrenchment exercises regardless of whether they were announced publicly by employers.
